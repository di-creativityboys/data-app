      Suspect in Maine shooting rampage is dead from apparent self-inflicted gunshot, authorities say
    "," 
  Editor’s Note: Follow along with CNN’s latest coverage of the shootings in Lewiston, Maine.
 
      A US Army reservist accused of killing 18 people and injuring 13 others in a shooting rampage in Maine this week was found dead Friday evening – apparently from a self-inflicted gunshot – after a two-day manhunt, a state official said.
   
      Robert Card, accused of committing Wednesday’s massacre at a bowling alley and a restaurant in Lewiston, Maine, was found dead around 7:45 p.m. Friday near the Androscoggin River in the Lisbon Falls area, some 10 miles Lewiston, state Public Safety Commissioner Michael Sauschuck told reporters.
   
      Maine Gov. Janet Mills said she is “breathing a sigh of relief tonight knowing that … Card is no longer a threat to anyone.”
   
      “Now is a time to heal,” Mills, who said Maine State Police found the body, told reporters at the news conference. “Tonight, the city of Lewiston and the state of Maine begin to move forward on a long road to healing.”
   
      Card’s body was found in an area near a recycling center from which he had recently been fired, a law enforcement source told CNN. Earlier this week, authorities had found Card’s vehicle abandoned after the shooting near a boat launch in the Lisbon area.
   
      Details about when Card died still were being investigated, Sauschuck said, and authorities haven’t announced a motive in the shooting. Authorities intend to release more information Saturday morning about Card and the investigation, they said.
   
      The discovery of Card’s body ends an intense two-day search that saw hundreds of officers scour parts of southern Maine by land, water and air, and finishes a period in which communities were simultaneously grieving and riddled with anxiety about the suspect’s location. Shelter-in-place orders for Androscoggin and northern Sagadahoc counties were in place from Wednesday night until they were lifted Friday afternoon, and schools, businesses and facilities were closed much of that time.
   
      Part of the reason the search for Card was expanded to waterways: Authorities found a note from Card that indicated that he did not expect to be alive when the note was found, a law enforcement official told CNN.
   
      The note essentially gave information to others about where things could be found and how things could be disposed of, the official said. Authorities had executed at least three search warrants Thursday on his vehicle, home and another property, the source said, which informed their search procedures Friday.
   
      Wednesday evening’s shooting was the deadliest US mass shooting since last year’s massacre at a school in Uvalde, Texas.
   
      Earlier Friday, multiple law enforcement sources told CNN the gun investigators believe Card used to carry out the massacre was purchased legally just days before he was hospitalized and ordered to undergo a psychiatric evaluation in July.
   
      In mid-July, New York State Police were called to Camp Smith in Cortlandt, New York, the military base where Card served, because he was acting “belligerently and possibly intoxicated,” according to a source briefed on the matter. Three law enforcement sources confirm state police brought Card to a nearby hospital, where he was treated for suspected intoxication and released the next day. When asked for information about the encounter, a New York State Police spokesperson told CNN: “This is an active investigation, and the New York State Police does not comment on active investigations.”
   
      A federal law enforcement source told CNN the army gave Card a “Command Referral” to seek treatment after he told army personnel at Camp Smith Card had been “hearing voices” and had thoughts about “hurting other soldiers.” A National Guard spokesperson confirmed to CNN Card was transported to the nearby Keller Army Community Hospital at the United States Military Academy for “medical evaluation,” after Army Reserve officials reported Card for “behaving erratically.”
   
      Card’s encounters with New York State Police and his National Guard superiors occurred just 10 days after Card had purchased the high-powered rifle at a Maine gun store, according to law enforcement sources. The rifle was a Ruger SFAR chambered for high-powered .308 ammunition, the sources added. The .308 round is favored by military snipers firing at long distances and big game hunters. It is larger and more powerful than the regular ammunition carried in the rifles of soldiers and SWAT teams.
   
      Sources say the weapon found inside Card’s 2013 white Subaru Outback appears to be the same one fired by the gunman at the bowling alley and a local bar, though a ballistics match has not been confirmed. The weapon will be processed by the FBI and ATF for fingerprints and DNA and then run through laboratory testing to determine if the bullets and shell casings found at the scene match.
   
      In the same July purchase, along with the rifle, sources say Card also bought a Beretta 92-F 9mm semi-automatic pistol. It is the standard pistol of the US military.
   
      The horror began around 7 p.m. Wednesday in Lewiston, where authorities say Card opened fire at Just-in-Time Recreation and then later at Schemengees Bar & Grille. Police were on the scene within just minutes of 911 calls made from the shooting locations, they said.
   
      In addition to the 18 people killed, 13 others were injured, the Maine governor said Thursday.
   
      Authorities identified all deceased victims Friday and said all their families had been notified. The oldest killed was a 76-year-old man and the youngest was a 14-year-old boy bowling with his father.
   
      The victims are Tricia Asselin, William Frank Brackett, Peyton Brewer-Ross, Thomas “Tommy” Conrad, Michael Deslauriers II, Jason Walker, Keith Macneir, Bryan MacFarlane, Ronald “Ron” Morin Arthur “Artie” Strout, Joseph “Joey” Walker, Joshua Seal, Maxx Hathaway, Robert “Bob” Violette, Lucille Violette, Stephen “Steve” Vozzella, William “Bill” Young and his son Aaron Young.
   
      Authorities searched two days across southern Maine for the suspect. Before Card’s body was found, authorities Friday still were urging residents across a 700-square-mile area to be vigilant as authorities raced to apprehend him.
   
Live Updates: Manhunt continues after Maine shooting rampage
 
      Before Card was found dead, investigators had recovered a cell phone that belonged to Card, a law enforcement official said Friday. It added to the challenges for investigators, who routinely track cell phones to find suspects.
   
      During the search, a CNN team saw officers surrounding a greenhouse late Friday morning at Springworks Farm in Lisbon, which is less than a mile from a boat launch where Card’s vehicle was found. Officers cleared the scene by noon.
   
      And while the motive for the massacre remained unannounced Friday evening, a key theory about why the bowling alley and the restaurant were targeted emerged during the investigation, law enforcement sources say.
   
      Card recently broke up with a longtime girlfriend, and investigators are pursuing a theory that Card went to the bowling alley and the bar because they were places the couple used to frequent, law enforcement sources told CNN’s John Miller.
   
      Investigators believe the ex-girlfriend had signed up to play in a tournament at the bar Wednesday night, the sources said. According to the Facebook page for Schemengees Bar and Grill, Wednesday is “Industry Night,” which draws employees from other bars and restaurants in the Lewiston area.
   
      Now that authorities know Card is dead, a hunting restriction that was in place for four communities because of the manhunt has been lifted, Sauschuck said Friday night. The lifting of the restriction in Lewiston, Lisbon, Bowdoin and Monmouth comes in time for Saturday’s opening of Maine’s rifle hunting season. 
 
      Card was a petroleum supply specialist in the Army Reserve and first enlisted in 2002, according to records provided by the Army. 
 
      Even though he was a certified firearms instructor, law enforcement officials told CNN, his time in the Army did not include training as a firearms instructor “nor did he serve in that capacity for the Army,” spokesperson Bryce Dubee said in a statement to CNN.
   
      Still, Card had extensive training, including land navigation, making him “very comfortable in the woods,” said Clifford Steeves, who told CNN he knew Card when they both served in the Army Reserve.
   
      He said Card is a skilled marksman who was one of the best shooters in his unit.
   
      Investigators searched the suspect’s car Thursday and recovered a .308-caliber AR15 rifle. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives will conduct tests to determine whether the gun can be matched to bullets and shell casings recovered at the two shooting scenes.
   
      Steeves met Card in the early 2000s when they served together and knew him until about a decade ago, he said. Steeves said he didn’t notice any concerning behavior from Card, who he described as an “outdoors type of guy.”
   
      “He was a very nice guy – very quiet. He never overused his authority or was mean or rude to other soldiers,” Steeves said. “It’s really upsetting.”
   
      Katie O’Neill, Card’s sister-in-law, told CNN he didn’t have a long history of mental health challenges.
   
      “This is something that was an acute episode. This is not who he is,” O’Neill said, referring to his July hospitalization. “He is not someone who has had mental health issues for his lifetime or anything like that.”

      Why teachers in South Korea are scared of their pupils – and their parents

      When fighting broke out in Kang Hyeon-joo’s elementary school classroom, her heart would beat so fast she could not breathe and her vision would blur.
   
      “They were throwing punches and kicking faces, throwing chairs and tables around,” she recalled, adding she had been hurt trying to intervene.
   
      For two years, Kang struggled to discipline her students – or cope with the parental backlash when she did. She claims her principal did nothing to help and would tell her simply to “just take a week off”.
   
      The strain took a dangerous toll. Kang says she started feeling the urge to jump in front of a bus. “If I just jumped at least, I would feel some relief. If I just jumped off a tall building, that would at least give me some peace.” 
   
      Kang is currently on sick leave but is far from alone in her experiences.
   
      Tens of thousands of teachers have been protesting in recent months, calling for more protection from students and parents. At one protest in Seoul last month, 200,000 gathered, according to organizers, forcing the government to take notice and action.
   
      The unified stand by the country’s teaching staff comes after the suicide of a first-grade teacher, in her early 20s, in July. She was found dead in her classroom in Seoul. Police have mentioned a problematic student and parental pressure while discussing her case, but have not given a definitive reason for her suicide.
   
      Several more teachers have taken their own lives since July and some of these cases have reportedly been linked to school stress, according to colleagues of the deceased and bereaved families.  
   
      Government data shows 100 public school teachers killed themselves from January 2018 to June 2023, 11 of them in the first six months of this year, but does not specify what factors contributed to their deaths.
   
      Sung Youl-kwan, a professor of education at Kyung Hee University, says the speed and size of the protests took many by surprise. “I think there has been like a shared feeling that this can happen to me too,” he said.
   
      Teachers point to a 2014 child abuse law, intended to protect children, as one of the main reasons they feel unable to discipline students. They say they are fearful of being sued by a small percentage of parents for causing emotional distress to their child and being dragged through the courts.
   
      “School is the last barrier to let students know what is okay in society and what is not. But we couldn’t do anything, if we teach them, we could be accused,” said Ahn Ji-hye, an elementary school teacher who helped organize previous protests.
   
      Ahn says parents have called her mobile phone some days from 6 a.m. until 11 p.m., wanting to talk about their child or complain.
   
      South Korea’s education minister Lee Ju-ho initially warned teachers that a mass strike would be an illegal act. That position was swiftly reversed, and a set of legal revisions passed the National Assembly on September 21, a fast piece of legislation.
   
      One of the key changes is providing teachers some protection from being sued for child abuse if their discipline is considered a legitimate educational activity. Also, the responsibility for handling school complaints and lawsuits brought by parents now rests with the principal. 
   
      “So far we have a culture where the school principal tended to pass those responsibilities to teachers,” said Professor Sung.
   
      The new law will also protect teachers’ personal information, such as their mobile phone numbers, and require parents to contact the school with concerns or complaints rather than the teacher directly.
   
      In the past, Ahn said, “If I could not give my personal phone number to them, sometimes some parents would come to the parking lot and watch and see and take a note of my phone number from my car, then they would text message me.” It is customary for Koreans to display their phone number in the bottom corner of their windscreen.
   
      Ahn welcomes the legal changes as “meaningful,” but insists higher-level laws like the Child Welfare Act and Child Abuse Punishment Act also need to be revised. “It is still possible to report teachers based on suspicion alone according to these laws,” she said.
   
      She says that, for now at least, the protests will continue. 
   
      One is planned for outside the National Assembly on October 28. Ahn says she would like to see penalties for parents who make unfounded accusations against teachers or practical measures put in place so that mandated changes can be adopted in classrooms, such as removing a disruptive student elsewhere to allow teaching to continue.
   
      Professor Sung believes the revisions will help in the short term, but cautions that the law should be seen as a safety net not a solution.
   
      Critics say South Korean society places a disproportionate level of importance on academic success so it should not be surprising that parents put teachers – and the wider education system – under so much pressure.
   
      It is the norm for students to attend a cram school, called hagwon, after their regular school hours, not as an extra but as a basic and expensive requirement to succeed. 
   
      On the day of the national college entrance exam, known as Suneung in Korean, airplanes are grounded, and commuting hours are adjusted to ensure that students taking the exams are not disturbed.
   
      “We have a culture in which parents have usually one child and they are ready to pour every financial resource and opportunity into this child,” Sung said. 
   
      “This pressure or obsession with education, sometimes with a high score, high achievement (mindset), is not a good environment for teachers (because) they are taking the pressure from the parents.”
   
      Sung says the days of a teacher being automatically respected are long gone, not just in South Korea but elsewhere in the world, and the teacher-parent dynamic is unrecognizable from just a decade or two ago.    
   
      “In educational policies, parents are regarded as like a consumer, with consumer sovereignty, and school and teachers are regarded as service providers”, he said, adding parents believe they “have the right to demand many things from schools.”
   
      In a country where education is considered central to success, teacher satisfaction is low. A survey by the Federation of Teachers’ Labor Union in April found 26.5% of teachers polled said they had received counseling or treatment for psychological issues due to their job. Some 87% said they have considered moving job or quitting in the past year.

      ‘Tombstone tourists’ find the beauty and joy in cemetery visits
    "," 
      Until she left for college, film historian Karie Bible spent almost her entire childhood living next to a cemetery.
   
      It’s where the Texas native rode her bike, played with her brother and passed by nearly every day. Other kids may have traded creepy stories about cemeteries or swore they’re haunted, but Bible was convinced of their value.
   
      “Being right next to a cemetery was normal for me,” she told CNN. “I always thought they were extremely beautiful.”
   
      Years later, after landing in Los Angeles as an adult, she ended up in one of the most famous cemeteries in the country: Hollywood Forever, a paean to Old Hollywood and the people who built it. There, visiting the graves of silent film star Marion Davies, famed director Cecil B. DeMille and ingénue icon Judy Garland, she found countless stories to tell.
   
      That was more than 20 years ago. She’s been the cemetery’s official tour guide ever since, leading visitors on monthly treks across the grounds to visit elaborate mausoleums, humbler headstones and various tributes to major stars and Hollywood everymen.
   
      “I love these people, and it gives me so much joy to keep their memories alive and their legacies going,” she told CNN.
   
      Bible spends her days with “tombstone tourists” — fans of cemeteries who travel across the country and world to significant cemeteries to commune with those buried there and bask in the history. (Philip Stone, founder and executive director of the Institute of Dark Tourism Research at the University of Central Lancashire in the United Kingdom, likened tombstone tourism to “sightseeing the mansions of the dead.”)
   
      Cemeteries aren’t conventional tourist destinations, but they’ve become essential stops for history buffs, aesthetes and curious visitors looking to learn more about the community they’re visiting. And “tombstone tourists” are always encouraging more to consider a cemetery’s the macabre beauty.
   
      “For me, a cemetery is like an art museum,” said Joy Neighbors, an author who writes  about her cemetery obsession in the blog A Grave Interest. “It’s always an adventure and always an experience to go in, dig around and see what you can find.”
   
      People often visit cemeteries for a connection to the past and to probe their own interest in death and the afterlife, said Sue Slocum, an associate professor of hospitality at George Mason University.
   
      Cemetery tourism is considered a form of “dark tourism,” or travel that involves visiting sites associated with death, she said. Dark tourism is predicated on a “preoccupation with death,” she said.
   
      “These are things that are part of being human,” said Slocum, who’s currently teaching a course on the subject. “(Cemeteries) celebrate community and the people buried there.”
   
      For the history-curious, cemeteries are rich resources. Tombstones themselves are monuments to the past and to the people buried beneath them, Neighbors said. Their design tells stories about the era in which they were produced — if it’s elaborate and well-kept, for example, it may mark the grave of a well-known and wealthy community member.
   
      Symbols on gravestones tell stories, too: In the 19th and 20th centuries, it was common for gravestones to bear symbols of religion or groups to which they belonged, like the Masonic square and compass. Children are often represented by lambs, Neighbors said, and some tombstones resemble trees from which limbs are cut, symbols of the deaths of family members.
   
      Even the birth and death dates can tell rich, devastating stories without words, she said.
   
      “It really makes you respect your heritage and the past,” Neighbors said.
   
      Many gravesites have become popular tourist destinations for their architecture, famous “residents” or historic significance: The Bonaventure Cemetery in Savannah, Georgia, is the Southern Gothic home to hundreds of Confederate soldiers and men who fought in the Spanish-American War, along with members of Savannah’s prominent 19th-century families. St. Mary Magdalene Churchyard in East Ham outside of London was a Roman burial site, discovered in the 19th century after hundreds of years of dormancy. And New Orleans’ St. Louis Cemetery No. 1 is home to dozens of locals who’ve since become urban legends, such as Voodoo queen Marie Laveau.
   
      “Cemeteries kind of have personalities,” Bible said. “They all have their own set of history and style — none of them are really the same experience.”
   
      In some places, Neighbors said, cemeteries function almost like parks: In Edinburgh, Scotland, the Greyfriars Kirkyard cemetery is open 24 hours a day, and people visit to knit, read, eat lunch and meet friends around its historic tombstones. (It’s also the home of the memorial for Greyfriars Bobby, a terrier who was said to have stood guard at his owner’s grave for 14 years. Visitors often bring him a stick to play fetch, Neighbors said — a way to “draw people in” to a cemetery instead of casting them out.)
   
      “To me, that’s what a cemetery should be,” she said.
   
      Bible sees her fair share of unruly cemetery guests: “There’s a reason why they have bike racks around Jim Morrison’s (grave),” she said, noting the barriers at Père Lachaise cemetery in Paris that surround The Doors’ frontman’s headstone.
   
      She has sympathy, though, for people whose interest in cemeteries is complicated. Sometimes, a visit to a cemetery can revive painful memories or pangs of grief for a lost loved one, she said.
   
      Cemeteries have often been considered places of quiet reverence, not venues for tourism or leisure. It’s a “very American concept” to maintain an air of solemnity in cemeteries, Slocum said. For years it was considered almost “sacrilegious to (visit) just to enjoy it,” Neighbors said.
   
      “You held your breath when you passed the cemetery,” Neighbors said of her grandparents’ view.
   
      Increasingly, though, historic cemeteries across the country and world are encouraging visitors to tour the grounds and learn the stories of the people buried there. Neighbors said she’s noticed families, joggers, even musicians start to spend time regularly at her local cemeteries when that was rare even 10 years ago. Some, like Atlanta’s Oakland Cemetery, have become community hubs where people walk their dogs or picnic — not just tourist destinations but resident mainstays.
   
      “People started realizing this is a gorgeous location we can utilize for other things than just visiting the dead,” Neighbors said. “There’s a wealth of experiences waiting to be discovered.”
   
      “There is a way to maintain your respect and curiosity,” Bible said of visiting a cemetery. “I think if you go in with the right attitude and realize why you’re there, there’s absolutely a way.”
   
Go with a purpose. 
 
      Cemeteries are sites for reflection and remembrance, not so much for littering, loitering or partying like the doomed teens of many a scary story. While you can visit public cemeteries on your own, many offer tours to teach visitors about its history and some of the people buried there — Slocum suggested taking a guided tour of a cemetery to get the most out of the experience.
   
Respect the space. 
 
      Even some of the best-known gravesites are working cemeteries, like Hollywood Forever, which still hosts funerals and performs burials and cremation services. It’s best to enter cemeteries, even those that offer tours or events, peacefully in case there are active funereal services taking place, Bible said.
   
      So, even on a tour themed to Halloween that leans into the spookier elements of cemeteries, it’s important to maintain “common decency for the dead, victims and their families,” Stone said.
   
Don’t tread where unwelcome.
 
      Not all cemeteries appreciate guests. If a gravesite is private or culturally significant and discourages visiting if you’re not a community member, it’s best to heed that guidance, Slocum said.

      Jenni Hermoso scores the winner on triumphant Spain return after unwanted kiss
    "," 
      Spain’s Jenni Hermoso scored a late winning goal on Friday in a glorious return to the national team following the unwanted kiss controversy that overshadowed La Roja’s World Cup win in August.
   
      The forward struck a left-footed drive in the 89th minute to give the world champions a 1-0 victory after coming on as a second half substitute in the UEFA Women’s Nations League match against Italy in Salerno.
   
      Television broadcasts showed traveling Spanish fans jumping for joy as Hermoso was surrounded by her celebrating teammates.
   
      “When Italy sat deep, we needed someone like Jenni to step up with her shooting boots,” Spain’s head coach Montse Tomé said after the game. “That Jenni scored the goal makes us all very happy. We’ve seen her smile and she’s everyone’s smile.”
   
      Hermoso, 33, who plays for Mexican club Pachuca Femenil, was not part of the Spain squad for their previous two games against Sweden and Switzerland in September. Tomé had explained her absence by saying she wanted to protect the star.
   
      Hermoso received an outpouring of global support after Spanish Football Federation President Luis Rubiales forcibly kissed her during the medal ceremony following Spain’s Women’s World Cup final victory over England in Sydney two months ago.
   
      The fallout over Rubiales’ behavior triggered a crisis in Spanish soccer and sparked condemnation in Spain and across the world.
   
      Following weeks of fierce criticism, Rubiales, 46, resigned last month as the country’s soccer president. He is now under investigation for “the crimes of sexual assault and coercion,” in a case being brought by Spanish prosecutors.
   
      Rubiales’ actions partly “ruined” the tournament and “derailed” Spain’s joyous celebrations, a senior official at soccer’s governing body FIFA said.
   
      “I didn’t take one second to realize that, oh, that was very inappropriate,” FIFA’s outgoing Secretary General Fatma Samoura told CNN Senior Sports Analyst Darren Lewis at the recent Best of Africa Awards in London.
   
      Spain next travel to Switzerland on October 31.

      Iran may not want a full-blown war with Israel, but it may be dragged into one
    "," 
  Editor’s Note: A version of this story appears in CNN’s Meanwhile in the Middle East newsletter, a three-times-a-week look inside the region’s biggest stories. Sign up here.
 
      A day after Palestinian militant group Hamas launched its brutal attack on Israel, a curious video emerged out of Tehran’s Azadi stadium. Hundreds of soccer fans, gathered to watch a match between Perspolis FC and Gol Gohar Sirjan FC, chanted in unison: “Shove the Palestinian flag up your a**.”
   
      The vulgar protest came in response to officials attempting to raise a Palestinian flag in the stadium to show support for the October 7 attack. But for the fans, it was another unwelcome mixing of politics and soccer, and a stark reminder of the Iranian government’s involvement in proxy battles in far-flung arenas.
   
      Hamas’ attack, which killed 1,400 people according to Israeli authorities, prompted a fierce aerial campaign on Gaza that has so far killed more than 7,000 people, according to the health ministry in Hamas-controlled Gaza. And there are now concerns that more fronts will open in the war, including one with Iran.
   
      Experts say that while Iran is wary of being dragged into the Israel-Hamas war, it may not be in full control if the militias it backs in the region independently intervene as Hamas suffers heavy blows and the death toll in Gaza continues to mount.
   
      “What connects all these groups to Iran is their anti-Israel policies,” said Sima Shine, head of the Iran program at the Institute for National Security Studies (INSS) in Tel Aviv, noting that while Iran has varying levels of influence over the groups, it doesn’t dictate all their actions.
   
      In the early days after the October 7 attack, questions were raised about Iran’s potential involvement in the killings. Tehran at the time commended the operation but was quick to deny any hand in it . Initial US intelligence also suggested that Iranian officials were surprised by Hamas’ attack, and that Tehran was not directly involved in its planning, resourcing or approval, CNN has reported.
 
      Despite its denial, however, Iran has ramped up its rhetoric against its arch enemy.
   
      Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian has warned that Israel’s bombardment of Gaza could have far-reaching consequences, saying that if Israel does not halt its airstrikes, “it is highly probable that many other fronts will be opened.”
   
      “This option is not ruled out and this is becoming increasingly more probable,” he told Al Jazeera last week.
   
      On Monday Abdollahian said the US has sent Iran two messages regarding escalation in the region.
   
      “The first message said that the United States is not interested in expanding the war, and the second message asked Iran to have self-restraint and insisted that Iran should also ask other countries and other sides to have self-restraint,” Abdollahian said during a news conference in Tehran Monday, without saying how and when the messages were delivered.
   
      He added that while the US says it wants to de-escalate, it has contradicted itself by continuing to support Israel.
   
      Trita Parsi, vice-president of the Quincy Institute in Washington, DC, said there is no appetite or desire from either Iran, the US or Israel for a wider war, but that Washington’s failure to restrain Israel may inadvertently drive the region towards escalation.
   
      US President Joe Biden last week pledged continued support for Israel, which has hardened Arab sentiment across the region and translated to mass protests against Israeli and American policies.
   
      “The only actor that has a clear interest in (a wider conflict) is Hamas, given that an enlargement of the war could change the dynamics in a favorable way for them,” Parsi said. In the absence of US efforts to rein in Israel, “many (regional) actors are going to feel compelled to step in… because of their own strategic calculations.”
   
      “When Israel is mobilizing 300,000 (troops), it is not likely that Hezbollah is going to sit there and assume that this is done only to go after Hamas,” he said, adding that it will factor in the risk of Israel going after the Lebanese group as well.
   
      An Iran-backed armed group and powerful regional force, Hezbollah has been trading fire with Israel’s military since the October 7 attack by Hamas. The fighting has been the worst since the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war, but it has so far been restricted to the border between Lebanon and Israel.
   
      Israel’s defense minister last week said that Israel was not interested in another war with Hezbollah. Israel has nonetheless turned the area of 4-kilometer radius near its border into a closed military zone, and evacuated residents from 28 communities within 2 kilometers of the Lebanese border.
   
      Hezbollah’s influence spans beyond Lebanon, however. It also operates alongside Iran’s elite Revolutionary Guard Corps in Syria, where the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights separates Israel from Tehran-aligned fighters.
   
      The Lebanese group also has its own channels with Hamas. Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah met Wednesday with top officials from Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, it said in a statement, without revealing where the meeting took place.
   
      “An assessment was made of…what the parties of the resistance axis must do at this sensitive stage to achieve a real victory for the resistance in Gaza and Palestine and to stop the treacherous and brutal aggression against our people,” it said.
   
      The Hamas-Israel conflict has also led to skirmishes in Syria and Iraq, from which Iran-backed militias have launched multiple drone attacks on US forces. And the US now has specific intelligence that those same groups could escalate even further as the war between Israel and Hamas continues, CNN reported this week.
 
      The US continues to warn Tehran against taking advantage of the current situation or encouraging its proxies to escalate. On Tuesday, Secretary of State Antony Blinken urged the United Nations Security Council to warn Iran against any further involvement.
   
      “Tell Iran, tell its proxies in public, in private, through every means: Do not open another front against Israel in this conflict. Do not attack Israel’s partners,” Blinken said, noting that a “broader conflict would be devastating, not only for Palestinians and Israelis, but for people across the region, and indeed, around the world.”
   
      The US on Thursday carried out airstrikes targeting two facilities linked to Iranian-backed militias in eastern Syria, according to a statement from Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin. The strikes came after a series of drone and rocket attacks against US forces in the region. The statement said the targeted facilities have been used by Iran’s IRGC and affiliated groups.
   
      Shine, of the INSS, said that Iran does not want a direct war with Israel because that would mean a direct war with the US. “It is very obvious that Iran does not want to be directly involved, and would prefer that (only) the proxies are involved.”
   
      But that may not play out exactly how Iran wants, added Shine, who previously served in the Israeli intelligence community for most of her career.
   
      “Iran has to take into account that the world is not operating according to what Iran decides or wants,” she told CNN. “So, if they decide to use their proxies too much, they might find themselves in a war they don’t want.”
   
      Parsi of the Quincy Institute said that the Iranian government is nonetheless preparing its population for war.
   
      Iranian media has been brimming with news of the Gaza war, with officials across Iran’s political spectrum expressing solidarity with Palestinians.
   
      “They’re already preparing the public opinion for this eventuality by essentially trying to make the argument that this is something that is brought to their doorstep because of what the Israelis are doing and because of the American support for it,” Parsi said.
   
      This shows there are already concerns in the Iranian government about how citizens will react to a war in which Iran is directly involved, he added.
   
      Even if there is a widener war that is still “below the threshold of a direct US-Iran engagement” – where it is restricted to Iranian proxies fighting Israel – it would still be an extremely unstable situation, he said. “No one can even control the current situation and make sure it doesn’t escalate.”

      IDF announces expanded ground operation in Gaza, amid communications blackout in the enclave
    "," 
      Israeli airstrikes rocked Gaza during a night of heavy bombardment after the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said Friday it is “expanding ground operations” in the besieged enclave, where communications links have reportedly been severed.
   
      In a statement Saturday, the IDF said its warplanes hit 150 underground targets in northern Gaza overnight, striking what it called terror tunnels and underground combat spaces and killing several Hamas operatives.
   
      Among those killed was Asem Abu Rakaba, the man in charge of Hamas’ aerial assets, who had taken part in planning the October 7 attacks on Israel and “directed the terrorists who infiltrated Israel on paragliders,” the IDF said.
   
      The IDF is “operating forcefully” on all fronts and will “continue striking Gaza City,” IDF spokesperson Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said Friday, repeating previous warnings that civilians should evacuate as he announced the intensified ground operation.
   
      Gaza residents told CNN that the evening’s airstrikes were the most intense they have experienced since Israel began to retaliate against Hamas’ October 7 terror attack around three weeks ago.
   
      Speaking to CNN by phone from near Gaza’s Al Aqsa Martyrs Hospital, one eyewitness, Salem Ahmad Ammar, told CNN that he and his wife had decided to separate in hopes that one would survive to care for their kids.
   
       “Don’t know if I (will) live to see the daylight tomorrow morning,” Ammar said. “I split from my wife, and the kids went to her parents’ house, and I came to the hospital here in the event we die in different places and maybe one of us would live and our kids will live. Difficult choices we are making.”
   
      A substantial ground offensive has been expected ever since the attacks, in which Hamas killed more than 1,400 people and saw some 200 people taken to Gaza as hostages. However, it is not yet clear whether the IDF announcement of an expanded operation signals the start of that push.
   
      Mark Regev, senior adviser to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, told CNN that an “expansion” of ground operations in Gaza means Israel’s army is “beefing up the pressure on Hamas.” He told CNN’s Jake Tapper “that pressure will increase and continue to increase until we achieve our goal.”
   
      This is the third night of Israeli ground actions in Gaza, as it amasses thousands of troops on the border with the enclave. It comes after weeks of bombardment and blockading Gaza, precipitating what aid agencies call a humanitarian crisis.
 
      Hamas has vowed to retaliate if Israeli ground troops enter Gaza. Izzat al-Rishq, a senior member of the Hamas political bureau, vowed that Hamas is ready to defeat Israeli soldiers if they enter the territory.
   
      Ghazi Hamad, a senior Hamas official, told the Associated Press on Thursday that Hezbollah and other allies were expected to play a bigger role as the Israel-Hamas war rages. “Hezbollah now is working against the occupation,” he said, adding a rare public appeal: “We appreciate this. But … we need more in order to stop the aggression on Gaza … We expect more.”
   
      Concerns have risen that Israel’s army may target Gaza hospitals after it alleged that the enclave’s largest medical center, Al Shifa, is the site of a Hamas command and control center – a claim that Palestinian authorities in Gaza and Ramallah, as well as doctors at the hospital, have denied.
   
      Hagari claimed Hamas of directing rocket attacks and commanding Hamas operations from bunkers underneath the hospital building, and appeared to suggest such hospitals could be on Israel’s target list. “When medical facilities are used for terror purposes, they are liable to lose their protection from attack in accordance with international law,” Hagari said.
   
      The Director General of the Gaza Health Ministry, Dr. Medhat Abbas, told CNN’s Eleni Giokos that Gaza’s hospitals, “are used to treat patients only” and are not being used “to hide anyone.” Hamas also rejected the claim, calling on “the United Nations, Arab and Islamic countries to immediately intervene to stop the madness of bombing and destroying the medical system.”
   
      Mustafa Barghouti of the Palestine National Initiative based in Ramallah said Israel was lying. “They keep lying to justify criminal acts against a civilian population, now they want to justify attacking people in a hospital” he told Sky News.
   
      And Mads Gilbert, a Norwegian physician who has worked at the Shifa hospital on several occasions, including during three periods of open hostilities between Hamas and Israel, called the allegations “old.”
   
      “We heard these unsubstantiated claims during the 2009 and 2014 attacks. We have never seen any single sign or proof, we’ve had zero restrictions on filming and photographing in Shifa, and have never been controlled in any ways,” he told CNN.
   
      The intensified bombardment began Friday evening, local time. A CNN team on the ground in southern Israel, close to the border with Gaza, reported a series of large explosions rocking Gaza City in the north of the enclave, and “unusual, intense and sustained” military activity and hearing heavy machine gunfire.
   
      Gaza appears largely cut off from the world, with communications in the enclave badly disrupted by airstrikes, according to Palestinian telecoms company Jawwal. London-based monitoring firm NetBlocks has also reported that the last standing major internet operator in the region, Paltel, has experienced damage to its international routes.
   
      Palestinian Authority Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh accused Israel of cutting communications and internet to Gaza on Friday in an “attempt to create darkness so that crimes can be committed” in preparation for an IDF ground operation.
   
      “The world is facing a historic moment” Shtayyeh told CNN, and called on the global community to act to stop “aggression and massacres” to come.
   
      Several aid organizations and UN agencies say they have now lost contact with local staff in Gaza.
   
      Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the organization had been unable to communicate with its staff and “health facilities, health workers and the rest of our humanitarian partners on the ground.”
   
      Catherine Russell, executive director of UNICEF, said on X, formerly Twitter, that she is “extremely concerned” about her team in Gaza after losing touch with them. “All humanitarians and the children and families they serve MUST be protected,” Russell added.
   
      Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), also known as Doctors Without Borders, said it had lost contact with some Palestinian colleagues in Gaza, while the International Committee of the Red Cross said it was “deeply worried” for the safety of its staff and civilians.
   
      “Without information in a communication blackout, people don’t know where to go for safety. Blackouts impede humanitarian and medical personnel from working safely and effectively,” the Red Cross said.
   
      International news agencies also expressed concern after the IDF said it cannot guarantee the safety of journalists reporting from Gaza, Reuters reported on Friday.
   
      At least 29 journalists have been killed during the Israel-Hamas war since October 7, making it the deadliest period for reporters covering conflict in decades, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ).
   
      The continuous bombardment of Gaza since hostilities broke out after the bloody October 7 attack has led to a crisis in the impoverished and densely-populated enclave.
   
      More than 2 million people are affected, the UN Relief Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) – the main UN agency in Gaza – warned on Friday, adding that amid food and water shortages, sewage is overflowing on the streets. More than 7,300 people have been killed and 18,500 more injured in Israeli attacks on Gaza since October 7, according to figures released Friday by the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Ramallah drawn from sources in the Hamas-controlled enclave.
   
      The ministry says children, women and the elderly make up 70% of those killed.
   
      Fifty-three UN staffers have also been killed since fighting began, with 14 dead in the past 24 hours, according to an UNRWA statement Friday.
   
      Gaza hospitals have been forced to work with dwindling resources and power shortages; eyewitnesses at Al Aqsa Martyrs hospital said on Friday the institution had been plunged into darkness.
   
      One eyewitness said Gaza has been “left in the dark with no connection to the outside world,” adding the hospital has received the bodies of 11 people killed and dozens injured from the intensified bombardment. They expect casualties to rise.
   
      Another eyewitness, Alla Majhool, said she came to the hospital because her 4-year-old niece was injured in a previous strike.
   
      “I am terrified and shaking, I can’t call my family and sisters to check on them, all we hear is explosions,” Majhool said. “It’s dark and there are no communications, we don’t know where the airstrikes and artillery shelling is hitting.”
   
      The Palestine Red Crescent Society said it has “completely lost contact with the operations room in Gaza and all our teams operating there.”
   
      Phillipe Lazzarini, the head of UNRWA said earlier on Friday that while aid has begun to trickle into Gaza from Egypt through the Rafah crossing, deliveries so far amounted to “nothing more than crumbs.”
   
      As the intensified bombardment began, Jordanian foreign minister Ayman Safadi urged nations to vote for a UN resolution calling for a halt to the fighting, saying on social media that the outcome of any Israeli ground operation “will be a humanitarian catastrophe of epic proportions for years to come.”
   
      “Millions will be watching every vote,” he said. “History will judge.”
   
      An overwhelming majority of 120 nations voted for the resolution, which calls for an immediate cessation of hostilities in the war between Israel and Hamas and for aid to be allowed to flow unrestricted into Gaza. The US and Israel sharply criticized the resolution text, however, for not explicitly criticizing Hamas.
   
      Israel’s ambassador to the UN Gilad Erdan asked the assembly, “Why are you defending murderers?”
   
      “Israel just endured the largest massacre of Jews since the Holocaust, and according to a majority of the so-called family of nations, Israel has no right to defend itself,” he said.
   
      Israel’s expanded ground operation comes amid ongoing efforts to free hostages held by Hamas in Gaza. Earlier on Friday, a source touted “significant progress” in negotiations.
   
      When asked about a possible deal, IDF spokesperson Hagari told reporters to “disregard rumors.” He dismissed reports that a hostage deal was close to being brokered as “psychological terror and a cynical use of Israeli civilians by Hamas.”
   
      The White House said it would not be appropriate to weigh in on Israel’s expanded military campaign.
   
      “We have, of course, certainly seen Israel undertake varied operations on the ground in the last couple of days,” National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters Friday. “But again, we’re not going to get into the habit of chiming in from the sidelines here on what they’re trying to do on the ground.”
   
      Kirby declined to say if Israel had informed the US before launching an expanded ground operation into Gaza Friday. He also declined to say if the Biden administration has confidence that Israel has fully considered the ramifications of a ground incursion.
   
      But Kirby said the US had held “active conversations” with Israel about a humanitarian pause to allow for the release of hostages. “We are working as hard today as we were yesterday and the day before and the day before to get these hostages home,” Kirby told CNN.

      ‘You get home and then start crying’: Israel’s body collectors encounter horrors beyond their worst nightmares
    "," 
Editor’s Note: The following story includes graphic material. Audience discretion is advised.
 
      Yanir Ishay has thrown away three boxes of cigarettes in the past two weeks.
   
      He said he thought he could smell death on them, having carried the packets in his pockets while collecting human remains from the sites of Hamas’ terror attack in southern Israel. Then his wife told him they were brand new — he’d just bought them.
   
      “That’s when I realized the smell was in my mind, not in the box,” he told CNN.
   
      Ishay is one of 120 volunteers – all of them men – working with ZAKA, a religious search and rescue organization, to recover the bodies of people killed near the Israel-Gaza perimeter by Hamas militants on October 7. Israeli authorities say more than 1,400 people were killed in the attack.
   
      In response, Israel declared war on Hamas, pounding Gaza with airstrikes that have killed more than 6,850 Palestinians, according to information published by the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Ramallah, drawn from sources in the Hamas-controlled enclave.
   
      Weeks on, as the war continues to rage, ZAKA volunteers are still collecting remains.
   
      “With all the preparations and with all the experience, never in our worst nightmares have we ever imagined we would see anything like what we have seen here,” Snir Elmalih, a longtime ZAKA member, told CNN at a cemetery in Ashdod, where he was working on Friday.
   
      He and other volunteers told CNN the victims of the massacre included whole families, little children, babies, even pregnant women, and that their bodies were found in a horrific state – mutilated and burnt.
   
      ZAKA has long worked in Israel and around the world, responding to terror attacks, accidents and disasters. Most of its members are deeply religious orthodox Jewish men and their mission is driven by the desire to ensure everyone, no matter what the circumstances of their death, can get a proper Jewish burial.
   
      “We believe that the respect for the dead is no less important – and sometimes more important – than the respect for the living,” Elmalih said. “We know how significant the idea of burying the dead is because God himself was involved in the burial of Moses.”
   
      On Friday morning, Elmalih was working at a cemetery in Ashdod, a city about 20 miles north of the Gaza Strip. A row of freshly dug graves in the burial grounds gets longer and longer each day, as more victims are identified and laid to rest. The cemetery has received so many bodies in the past two weeks that Elmalih needed to bring in extra refrigerated storage.
   
      He was preparing yet another funeral when Yossi Landau, one of ZAKA’s founding members, came by to say hello and drop off a care package. They spent a few minutes chatting, then gave each other a hug.
   
      Landau, chief of the group’s southern command, says he tries to provide emotional support for his men, but the trauma cuts deep and there is only so much he can do to help.
   
      “I know them more than anyone else. The size of their shoes. I know when they get up in the morning. I know if they have any problems. I know when they need help and when they need to step aside,” he told CNN.
   
      The aftermath of the attack is so gruesome that only the most experienced ZAKA volunteers are allowed to take part in body collection.
   
      And even for them, it is often too much.
   
      “Everybody cries,” said Eli Landau, Yossi’s son and fellow volunteer. He spoke to CNN in Be’eri, one of the kibbutzim communities close to the perimeter fence that Hamas militants rampaged through. At least 130 of its 1,100 residents were murdered and dozens were kidnapped, according to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF).
   
      “You can cry and everybody will understand. It’s not stuff that I want to talk about and with these guys, I don’t need to talk. We understand each other,” Eli Landau said.
   
      On Friday, he and other ZAKA volunteers were combing through homes in Be’eri for the second time, finding more victims and collecting remains left behind during their first visit.
   
      Jewish tradition requires the body to be buried in its entirety, which means the volunteers painstakingly search sites for even the smallest fragments of the victims’ remains and traces of blood.
   
      “It’s important to collect the whole body. Even the blood that has left the body. That’s why the work is not done yet. We’re going to go back to each and every community to clean everything, all the blood, so it can be buried,” Elmalih explained.
   
      It’s a task that is becoming more and more difficult as time goes by. “These volunteers, they are exposed to the most difficult parts of the war. They are getting to the scenes, smelling the smells, seeing the horrific sights,” Elmalih added.
   
      As ZAKA volunteers worked in Be’eri, several busloads of foreign journalists arrived, escorted by the IDF. Yossi Landau stood in front of them, repeating over and over again what he saw when he first got there, answering questions, occasionally pausing to collect himself. He said he has made it his mission to spread the message.
   
      Eli, his son, watched from afar, crying. “I don’t know why is he doing what he is doing, talking about this again and again and again. He is going to lose his mind. It’s not healthy for him, it cannot be good for any soul,” he said.
   
      ZAKA volunteers Yanir Ishay, Yitzhak Ben-Shibrit and his son Aharon spent much of their Sunday working just a few hundred feet from the Gaza border fence, trying to recover the remains of people who were killed there.
   
      “The military were protecting us, but we came under fire and there was nowhere to hide,” Aharon Ben-Shibrit said, showing CNN a video of the volunteers lying pinned to the floor in as Hamas rockets flew overhead.
   
      The job is dangerous – physically and mentally.
   
      “The mental side is worse though,” Ishay said. “When you die, you die, there’s nothing after that. It’s different with your mind,” he said.
   
      Ishay said he trusts his fellow volunteers completely – not just when they are dealing with a difficult scene, but also when they tell him it’s time to step away. Last week, he took a day off after spending his birthday collecting the dead. It was too much, he said.
   
      Most ZAKA volunteers say that they haven’t begun to process the trauma, and when they can step away, they don’t want to think.
   
      “We disconnect ourselves from the world. You come to the field, you start working and nothing else matters. You get home and then start crying,” Yitzhak Ben-Shibrit said.

      Suspect in Maine shooting rampage is dead from apparent self-inflicted gunshot, authorities say
    "," 
  Editor’s Note: Follow along with CNN’s latest coverage of the shootings in Lewiston, Maine.
 
      A US Army reservist accused of killing 18 people and injuring 13 others in a shooting rampage in Maine this week was found dead Friday evening – apparently from a self-inflicted gunshot – after a two-day manhunt, a state official said.
   
      Robert Card, accused of committing Wednesday’s massacre at a bowling alley and a restaurant in Lewiston, Maine, was found dead around 7:45 p.m. Friday near the Androscoggin River in the Lisbon Falls area, some 10 miles Lewiston, state Public Safety Commissioner Michael Sauschuck told reporters.
   
      Maine Gov. Janet Mills said she is “breathing a sigh of relief tonight knowing that … Card is no longer a threat to anyone.”
   
      “Now is a time to heal,” Mills, who said Maine State Police found the body, told reporters at the news conference. “Tonight, the city of Lewiston and the state of Maine begin to move forward on a long road to healing.”
   
      Card’s body was found in an area near a recycling center from which he had recently been fired, a law enforcement source told CNN. Earlier this week, authorities had found Card’s vehicle abandoned after the shooting near a boat launch in the Lisbon area.
   
      Details about when Card died still were being investigated, Sauschuck said, and authorities haven’t announced a motive in the shooting. Authorities intend to release more information Saturday morning about Card and the investigation, they said.
   
      The discovery of Card’s body ends an intense two-day search that saw hundreds of officers scour parts of southern Maine by land, water and air, and finishes a period in which communities were simultaneously grieving and riddled with anxiety about the suspect’s location. Shelter-in-place orders for Androscoggin and northern Sagadahoc counties were in place from Wednesday night until they were lifted Friday afternoon, and schools, businesses and facilities were closed much of that time.
   
      Part of the reason the search for Card was expanded to waterways: Authorities found a note from Card that indicated that he did not expect to be alive when the note was found, a law enforcement official told CNN.
   
      The note essentially gave information to others about where things could be found and how things could be disposed of, the official said. Authorities had executed at least three search warrants Thursday on his vehicle, home and another property, the source said, which informed their search procedures Friday.
   
      Wednesday evening’s shooting was the deadliest US mass shooting since last year’s massacre at a school in Uvalde, Texas.
   
      Earlier Friday, multiple law enforcement sources told CNN the gun investigators believe Card used to carry out the massacre was purchased legally just days before he was hospitalized and ordered to undergo a psychiatric evaluation in July.
   
      In mid-July, New York State Police were called to Camp Smith in Cortlandt, New York, the military base where Card served, because he was acting “belligerently and possibly intoxicated,” according to a source briefed on the matter. Three law enforcement sources confirm state police brought Card to a nearby hospital, where he was treated for suspected intoxication and released the next day. When asked for information about the encounter, a New York State Police spokesperson told CNN: “This is an active investigation, and the New York State Police does not comment on active investigations.”
   
      A federal law enforcement source told CNN the army gave Card a “Command Referral” to seek treatment after he told army personnel at Camp Smith Card had been “hearing voices” and had thoughts about “hurting other soldiers.” A National Guard spokesperson confirmed to CNN Card was transported to the nearby Keller Army Community Hospital at the United States Military Academy for “medical evaluation,” after Army Reserve officials reported Card for “behaving erratically.”
   
      Card’s encounters with New York State Police and his National Guard superiors occurred just 10 days after Card had purchased the high-powered rifle at a Maine gun store, according to law enforcement sources. The rifle was a Ruger SFAR chambered for high-powered .308 ammunition, the sources added. The .308 round is favored by military snipers firing at long distances and big game hunters. It is larger and more powerful than the regular ammunition carried in the rifles of soldiers and SWAT teams.
   
      Sources say the weapon found inside Card’s 2013 white Subaru Outback appears to be the same one fired by the gunman at the bowling alley and a local bar, though a ballistics match has not been confirmed. The weapon will be processed by the FBI and ATF for fingerprints and DNA and then run through laboratory testing to determine if the bullets and shell casings found at the scene match.
   
      In the same July purchase, along with the rifle, sources say Card also bought a Beretta 92-F 9mm semi-automatic pistol. It is the standard pistol of the US military.
   
      The horror began around 7 p.m. Wednesday in Lewiston, where authorities say Card opened fire at Just-in-Time Recreation and then later at Schemengees Bar & Grille. Police were on the scene within just minutes of 911 calls made from the shooting locations, they said.
   
      In addition to the 18 people killed, 13 others were injured, the Maine governor said Thursday.
   
      Authorities identified all deceased victims Friday and said all their families had been notified. The oldest killed was a 76-year-old man and the youngest was a 14-year-old boy bowling with his father.
   
      The victims are Tricia Asselin, William Frank Brackett, Peyton Brewer-Ross, Thomas “Tommy” Conrad, Michael Deslauriers II, Jason Walker, Keith Macneir, Bryan MacFarlane, Ronald “Ron” Morin Arthur “Artie” Strout, Joseph “Joey” Walker, Joshua Seal, Maxx Hathaway, Robert “Bob” Violette, Lucille Violette, Stephen “Steve” Vozzella, William “Bill” Young and his son Aaron Young.
   
      Authorities searched two days across southern Maine for the suspect. Before Card’s body was found, authorities Friday still were urging residents across a 700-square-mile area to be vigilant as authorities raced to apprehend him.
   
Live Updates: Manhunt continues after Maine shooting rampage
 
      Before Card was found dead, investigators had recovered a cell phone that belonged to Card, a law enforcement official said Friday. It added to the challenges for investigators, who routinely track cell phones to find suspects.
   
      During the search, a CNN team saw officers surrounding a greenhouse late Friday morning at Springworks Farm in Lisbon, which is less than a mile from a boat launch where Card’s vehicle was found. Officers cleared the scene by noon.
   
      And while the motive for the massacre remained unannounced Friday evening, a key theory about why the bowling alley and the restaurant were targeted emerged during the investigation, law enforcement sources say.
   
      Card recently broke up with a longtime girlfriend, and investigators are pursuing a theory that Card went to the bowling alley and the bar because they were places the couple used to frequent, law enforcement sources told CNN’s John Miller.
   
      Investigators believe the ex-girlfriend had signed up to play in a tournament at the bar Wednesday night, the sources said. According to the Facebook page for Schemengees Bar and Grill, Wednesday is “Industry Night,” which draws employees from other bars and restaurants in the Lewiston area.
   
      Now that authorities know Card is dead, a hunting restriction that was in place for four communities because of the manhunt has been lifted, Sauschuck said Friday night. The lifting of the restriction in Lewiston, Lisbon, Bowdoin and Monmouth comes in time for Saturday’s opening of Maine’s rifle hunting season. 
 
      Card was a petroleum supply specialist in the Army Reserve and first enlisted in 2002, according to records provided by the Army. 
 
      Even though he was a certified firearms instructor, law enforcement officials told CNN, his time in the Army did not include training as a firearms instructor “nor did he serve in that capacity for the Army,” spokesperson Bryce Dubee said in a statement to CNN.
   
      Still, Card had extensive training, including land navigation, making him “very comfortable in the woods,” said Clifford Steeves, who told CNN he knew Card when they both served in the Army Reserve.
   
      He said Card is a skilled marksman who was one of the best shooters in his unit.
   
      Investigators searched the suspect’s car Thursday and recovered a .308-caliber AR15 rifle. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives will conduct tests to determine whether the gun can be matched to bullets and shell casings recovered at the two shooting scenes.
   
      Steeves met Card in the early 2000s when they served together and knew him until about a decade ago, he said. Steeves said he didn’t notice any concerning behavior from Card, who he described as an “outdoors type of guy.”
   
      “He was a very nice guy – very quiet. He never overused his authority or was mean or rude to other soldiers,” Steeves said. “It’s really upsetting.”
   
      Katie O’Neill, Card’s sister-in-law, told CNN he didn’t have a long history of mental health challenges.
   
      “This is something that was an acute episode. This is not who he is,” O’Neill said, referring to his July hospitalization. “He is not someone who has had mental health issues for his lifetime or anything like that.”

      Anxious Maine communities feel relief after man accused of killing 18 people is found dead
    "," 
      A sense of relief washed over a grieving Maine community that endured two days of fear after authorities announced the man accused of killing 18 people at a bowling alley and a restaurant earlier this week was found dead on Friday evening.
   
      The body of Robert Card, 40, was discovered near a river some 10 miles from the shattered community of Lewiston with an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound, Maine Public Safety Commissioner Michael Sauschuck said at a news conference Friday night.
   
      The discovery ended a roughly two-day manhunt that left many residents in the serene, picturesque area living on edge and fearful to leave their homes.
   
      Maine Gov. Janet Mills said she, like others, was relieved that the manhunt and the fear that came attached to it was over.
   
      “Like many people, I’m breathing a sigh of relief tonight knowing that Robert Card is no longer a threat to anyone,” Mills said at a news conference Friday evening. “I know there are some people – many people – who share that sentiment, but I also know that his death might not bring solace to many.”
   
      She said the discovery would allow the community to move on and begin “a long and difficult road to healing – but we will heal together.”
   
      The extensive manhunt started Wednesday night after gunshots rang out at Just-in-Time Recreation and later at Schemengees Bar & Grille in Lewiston, according to officials. The 18 people killed, whom officials identified Friday, ranged in age from 14 to 76. They included a boy who was bowling with his father, contestants in a cornhole tournament for the deaf, and several fathers who leave behind young children. The shooting rampage left 13 others injured, officials said.
   
      A survivor of the massacre, whose cousin Tricia Asselin was killed in the shooting, was relieved to hear the suspect was found dead so the “community itself can definitely move on without the fear of him out there,” she told CNN’s Kaitlan Collins on Friday night, adding she was “sad because we have so many questions left unanswered.”
   
      Tammy Asselin, who was separated from her 10-year-old daughter as the shooting began at the bowling alley at Just-in-Time Recreation, continued: “I know it does give my daughter some peace to know that he has been caught, because that was a fear of hers – that he’s still out there.”
   
Here’s more of the latest in Maine:
 
• Authorities plan to hold a news conference Saturday at 10 a.m. ET to discuss more about the suspect, the discovery of his body and their search efforts.
   
• The gun investigators believe Card used to carry out the massacre was purchased legally in July, just days before he was hospitalized and ordered to undergo a psychiatric evaluation, according to multiple law enforcement sources.
   
• Card’s body was found near a recycling center from which he had recently been fired, a law enforcement source told CNN.
   
• All 18 victims in the attack were identified Friday by officials. They range in age from 14 to 76.
   
      Law enforcement officials say Card, a US Army reservist and certified firearms instructor, had extensive training that included land navigation and firearms. He was described as a skilled marksman and one of the best shooters in his unit by someone who served with him.
   
      Tammy Asselin, the woman whose cousin Tricia was killed, told CNN Friday she wants to know why the gunman targeted the locations, and why he fired when children were there, among other questions she said might never be answered now.
   
      “You know, it is just those ‘why’ questions that unfortunately are left unanswered and we will probably never have those answers to.”
   
      People across the community, state and country have echoed a sense of relief for those in area after days of uncertainty.
   
      President Joe Biden said he is grateful Maine residents are safe “after spending excruciating days hiding in their homes.”
   
      Biden, in a statement Friday night after the suspect was found dead, said his administration will continue “to provide everything that is needed to support the people of Maine.” He also reiterated his call to Congress to address gun violence.
   
      “Americans should not have to live like this,” Biden said. “I once again call on Republicans in Congress to fulfill their obligation to keep the American people safe. Until that day comes, I will continue to do everything in my power to end this gun violence epidemic. The Lewiston community – and all Americans – deserve nothing less.”
   
      Even before the discovery of Card’s body, the Lewiston community showcased its strength Friday. People trickled onto the streets of downtown Lewiston, covered in fall leaves, amid the lingering sense of uncertainty over Card’s whereabouts and alarming messages from authorities to be vigilant.
   
      A steady stream of people walked the sidewalks, and entered and exited buildings. Several drivers traveled through the area even before the shelter-in-place order, which authorities enacted early in the manhunt, was lifted early Friday evening, just hours before authorities said Card’s body had been found.
   
      Someone decorated trees with supportive paper-hearted messages like “to my community” and “to my neighbors” on trees in downtown Lewiston.
   
      Several businesses remained closed throughout the afternoon, but some owners, like the Halal markets serving the area’s immigrant community, said they opened their doors for a shortened period Friday due to safety concerns.
   
      An emotional Deborah Roy, still grieving from the loss of her 92-year-old mother a few weeks ago, tried to hold back tears as she told CNN she’d been at home for three days before visiting a grocery store earlier Friday in Lisbon, a town 15 minutes away from Lewiston.
   
      “I just wanted to go for a ride to get away,” Roy said. A line of customers stretched to the back of the store that afternoon as several other businesses remained closed during the shelter-in-place order.
   
      Roy said she saw “people, cars everywhere, (and) cameras” while en route to the store.
   
      “When I came down over that bridge and I saw all the officers, it hit home,” Roy said tearfully.
   
﻿“I’m just blown away to see this happening in our own little town,” she said. “How one person can tip the world upside down, it’s devastating.”
   
      Just over 48 hours after the manhunt began, authorities found Card’s body at 7:45 p.m. Friday near the Androscoggin River in the Lisbon Falls area, some 10 miles from Lewiston, said Sauschuck, the state public safety commissioner.
   
      Card’s body was found near a recycling center from which he had recently been fired, a law enforcement source told CNN. Earlier this week, authorities had found Card’s vehicle abandoned after the shooting near a boat launch in the Lisbon area.
   
      The body was in a wooded area, multiple sources told CNN.
   
      Details about when Card died “remains to be seen,” Sauschuck said Friday, and authorities haven’t announced a motive in the shooting.
   
      While no motive has been announced, a key theory about why the bowling alley and the restaurant were targeted emerged during the investigation, law enforcement sources told CNN Thursday. Card recently broke up with a longtime girlfriend, and investigators are pursuing the theory Card went to the bowling alley and the bar because they were places the couple used to frequent, law enforcement sources told CNN’s John Miller.
   
      Before Card’s death was announced, authorities found a note from Card that indicated that he did not expect to be alive when the note was found, a law enforcement official told CNN on Friday.
   
      The note’s discovery prompted the manhunt’s shift to include a water search in the Androscoggin River near where investigators found Card’s abandoned vehicle in Lisbon. But after an extensive search that included divers, underwater vessels and aircraft – Card was still not found.
   
      Over two days, law enforcement officers with long guns surrounded and searched various areas across the typically quiet area, from a greenhouse at Springworks Farm in Lisbon to homes and places connected to the suspect.
   
      Law enforcement officers twice visited Card’s home on Thursday, surrounding the home that night ordering any occupants to come out, though it was unclear whether anyone was inside.
   
      Investigators had earlier executed a search warrant Thursday at the home, looking for computers, notes, weapons and any evidence that might indicate a plan for the shootings, law enforcement sources told CNN.
   
      A law enforcement official said Friday that investigators have also recovered a cell phone that belonged to the suspect.
   
      Investigators said they believe the gun Card used in the massacre was legally bought  just days before he was hospitalized and ordered into undergoing a psychiatric evaluation in mid-July, according to multiple law enforcement sources.
   
      Card, who first enlisted in the Army Reserve in 2002, was reported by Army Reserve officials for “behaving erratically,” prompting New York State Police to respond to the Camp Smith military base where Card served in Cortlandt, New York.
   
      Card was reportedly acting “belligerently and possibly intoxicated,” according to a source briefed on the matter, and state police transported him to a nearby hospital for suspected intoxication. He was released the next day, authorities said.
   
      When asked for information about the encounter, a New York State Police spokesperson told CNN: “This is an active investigation, and the New York State Police does not comment on active investigations.”
   
      The Army gave Card a “Command Referral” to seek treatment after a federal law enforcement source told Army personnel that Card had been “hearing voices” and had thoughts about “hurting other soldiers,” the source told CNN.
   
      The encounters happened 10 days after Card purchased the high-powered rifle at a Maine gun store, law enforcement sources said. The powerful rifle was a Ruger SFAR chambered for high-powered 308 ammunition, according to the sources.
   
      Sources also say the weapon found inside Card’s vehicle appears to be the same fired by the gunman at the bowling alley and a bar, though a ballistics match has not been confirmed.
   
      The weapon will be processed by the FBI and ATF for fingerprints and DNA and then run through laboratory testing to determine if the bullets and shell casings found at the scene match.
   
      Along with the rifle, sources say Card also bought a Beretta 92-F 9mm semi-automatic pistol in July. It is the standard pistol of the US military.
   
      Shortly before 7 p.m. on Wednesday, Card began shooting at a Lewiston bowling alley, and later at a bar in the largely working-class community, authorities say.
   
      Officers responded to the shooting locations in Lewiston within minutes of 911 calls, police said.
   
      The initial 911 call from Just-In-Time Recreation came in at 6:56 p.m., and the first Lewiston police officer arrived at 7 p.m., Sauschuck said Friday.
   
      People ran from the bowling alley as police cruisers responded to the scene, video obtained by CNN showed.
   
      About 12 minutes after the first calls, authorities received multiple 911 calls about a shooter at Schemengees Bar and Grille Restaurant, roughly 4 miles from the bowling alley.
   
      The shooting and subsequent manhunt for Card prompted shelter-in-place orders for Androscoggin and northern Sagadahoc counties, where Lewiston, Auburn and Lisbon are located.
   
      Investigators executed a search warrant on Thursday at Card’s home, looking for computers, notes, weapons and any evidence that might indicate a plan for the shootings, law enforcement sources told CNN.
   
      Authorities say they found the suspect’s car abandoned about 8 miles from Lewiston in Lisbon.
   
      The 18 victims from the shooting rampage were identified Friday – with victims ranging in age from 14 to 76.
   
      Father and son Bill and Aaron Young were enjoying a night of bowling when the shooting occurred. They were both killed.
   
      Aaron, 14, was an honor student who took pride in his grades, Aaron’s sister and Bill’s stepdaughter, Kayla Putnam, told CNN affiliate WCVB.
   
      Bill was an auto mechanic, Putnam said, and the rock of the family.
   
      “It’s going to be very hard for the family right now to deal without him because he was kind of the center of the family and everything,”  Putnam told WCVB.
   
      Bob Violette, 76, was days away from turning 77 when he was shot and killed at the bowling alley, according to CNN affiliate ﻿WBZ.
   
      Violette’s relatives say he was teaching a youth bowling league when gunfire erupted, and they believe he died protecting his students, WBZ reported. His wife, Lucille, also died in the attack.
   
      “Bob’s helped with the youth league for as long as I can remember,” Violette’s friend Brandon Dubuc told WBZ. “If he was there with those kids, he was protecting those kids. I have no doubt about that.”

      What we know about the victims of the Maine mass shooting
    "," 
      For the victims of the mass shooting Wednesday night in Lewiston, Maine, it was an ordinary night out.
   
      Some were participating in a cornhole tournament while others were enjoying a meal.  Then a shooter ended their fun.
   
      And now another American community is grieving as the identities of those friends and loved ones whose lives were lost emerge.
   
      The suspect in the shooting rampage that left 18 people dead and 13 others wounded at a restaurant and bowling alley was found dead Friday evening after a two-day manhunt, authorities said. Robert Card was found dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound along a river in nearby Lisbon Falls, according to state Public Safety Commissioner Michael Sauschuck.
   
      All the victims were identified Friday by officials. The oldest killed in the shootings was a 76-year-old man and the youngest was a 14-year-old boy bowling with his father.
   
      It is the deadliest mass shooting in the United States this year, and the worst since a gunman killed 19 students and two teachers at a school in Uvalde, Texas, last year. Overall, at least 566 mass shootings have happened this year across the country, with four or more shot excluding the shooter, according to the Gun Violence Archive.
   
      Here’s what we know so far about the victims:
   
      Tricia Asselin, 53, was the heart of her tight-knit family and worked as a part-time employee at the bowling alley, Just-in-Time Recreation, her siblings told CNN.Even on her night off on Wednesday, Asselin was at Just-in-Time, her brother told CNN.“What I’m told is that when it all started happening, she ran up to the counter and started to call 911, and that’s when she was shot,” DJ Johnson told CNN. “That was just her. She wasn’t going to run. She was going to try and help.”
   
      His other sister was also there and was able to escape, Johnson said.
   
      Stephen Vozzella was an active member of the New England Deaf Cornhole community and someone who brought excitement and a smile to competitions, according to statements from his brother and The National Association of Letter Carriers, which represents city delivery letter carriers employed by the U.S. Postal Service. 
   
      “Brother Vozzella was only 45 years old,” NALC President Brian L. Renfroe said in a statement. “He had much more life to live before it was stolen from him in an all-too-common senseless act of gun violence.”
   
      In a statement about the tragedy, the Governor Baxter School for the Deaf noted Vozzella’s death and said the attack took the lives of several in their community. 
   
      “We lost four of our cherished community members in last night’s Lewiston shootings. Including two fathers of children in our programs,” the school’s executive director, Karen Hopkins, said in a Facebook post. “Some of our staff were very close to these members of our community.”
   
      Vozzella, who was an active cornhole player, also participated in several tournaments in the region organized by the New England Deaf Cornhole league.
   
      “With sadly and heavy hearts, NEDC has lost a member of our community, Steve Vozzella. He was one the victims lost in the shooting in Maine,” the organization wrote in a Facebook post Thursday. It noted he’d brought “excitement” and a “huge smile” to competitions. “He will be missed on and off the courts!”
   
      The New England Deaf Cornhole league plans to hold a moment of silence in Vozzella’s honor during an upcoming tournament in November, the group said in their post.
   
      Peyton Brewer-Ross, 39, was participating in a cornhole tournament at Schemengees Bar & Grille Restaurant when he was killed, his brother Ralph Brewer told CNN. Brewer-Ross loved playing cornhole and enjoying hanging out with friends at Schemengees.
   
      Brewer-Ross “loved being a dad more than anything else,” his brother said. Two weeks ago, Brewer-Ross celebrated the second birthday of his daughter, Elle.
   
      Tommy Conrad, 34, was identified as one of the victims of the Lewiston mass shootings. Conrad was the manager at the bowling alley and is survived by his 9-year-old daughter, his family confirmed to CNN affiliate WMTW.
   
      Michael Deslauriers II, 51, was killed while attempting to charge at the shooter at the bowling alley, his father, Michael Deslauriers Sr., said on Facebook.
 
      Deslauriers Sr., who is the chairman of the Sabattus Historical Society, announced on the organization’s Facebook page that his son and his friend died trying to stop the shooter.
   
      “They made sure their wives and several young children were under cover then they charged the shooter,” Deslauriers Sr. said.
   
      Deslauriers Sr. described making the announcement as the “hardest news for a father to ever have to share.”
   
      Jason Walker, 51, was identified as one of the victims in the shooting rampage, according to Department of Public Safety Commissioner Mike Sauschuck.
   
      Bryan MacFarlane, 40, was participating in the cornhole tournament at Schemengees when he was killed, his sister Keri Brooks told CNN.
   
      MacFarlane, who’s part of the local deaf community, usually goes to Schemengees on Wednesdays where people from the deaf community gather to play cornhole, Brooks said.
   
      Arthur “Artie” Strout, 42, was at Schemengees during the shooting, his father, Arthur Bernard, told CNN affiliate WBZ.
   
      Bernard said he had just left Schemengees when he received the heartbreaking call that there was an active shooter.
   
      Strout’s family thought he was at the hospital but learned the news of his death on Thursday. He leaves behind five children.
   
      Leroy Walker, a city councilor in Auburn, Maine, told CNN affiliate WGME, his son, Joseph Walker, 57, was one of the victims at Schemengees. Walker said state police told his son’s wife that Joseph, the manager of the bar, picked up a knife and went after the gunman to try and stop him from killing other people and that’s when Joseph was shot to death.
   
      After 14 hours of waiting, Walker said he and his family were notified of Joseph’s death.
   
      “I’m very proud of my son,” Leroy Walker said on CNN on Friday morning, adding his son was a loving person who will be missed by thousands. “I know that definitely he would do this all over again.
   
      “For someone to do this to so many families, as well as my own, it’s just crazy. It just leaves you an empty hole that I don’t know how it will ever be filled.”
   
      He said he has no hatred for the killer.
   
      “You have to put that out of your mind,” he said. “You have to let the Lord do whatever needs to be done. If you hate, and the hate drives you crazy, you’re going to hurt people. Hate will never bring my son back.”
   
      Beloved American Sign Language interpreter Joshua Seal had been taking part in the cornhole tournament for deaf athletes at Schemengees when he was killed Wednesday, according to his wife, says CNN affiliate, WGME.
 
      Seal’s employer, Pine Tree Society, said in a Facebook statement that Seal, 36, was the director of interpre﻿ting services.
   
      Seal gained attention during the pandemic as one of the lead interpreters for the deaf for Maine Gov. Janet Mills and Dr. Nirav Shah during the daily Covid-19 briefings.
   
      “He was a husband, a father of four and a tireless advocate for the Deaf community. He was committed to creating safe space for Deaf people and was widely known as the ASL interpreter for Dr. Shah’s pandemic briefings. The ripple effects of his loss will be felt by countless Maine people,” reads the Facebook post.
 
      In a Facebook tribute to her husband, Elizabeth Seal says he was a supportive father who loved spending time with his children.
   
      “He (Joshua) always loved spending time with them, traveling, going for a day trip to the beach, or going camping for the weekend,” Seal’s wife said. “Not only was he an amazing father, he was a wonderful husband, my best friend, and my soulmate. He was also a wonderful boss, an incredible interpreter, a great friend, a loving son, brother, uncle, and grandson. He loved his family and always put them first. That is what he will always be remembered for.”
   
      Keith Macneir, 64, was identified as one of the victims in the shooting rampage, according to Department of Public Safety Commissioner Mike Sauschuck.
   
      Maxx Hathaway was a full-time, stay-at-home dad of two, with a third child on the way, his sister, Kelsay Hathaway said.
   
      “He was a goofy, down to earth person, loved to joke around and always had an uplifting attitude no matter what was going on,” Kelsay Hathaway said in a verified GoFundMe campaign she set up. “Brenda (his wife), the girls, his family and friends meant the world to him, and his loss will be felt among the communities that he was a part of and grew up in.”
   
      Hathaway’s wife is due in a little over a month, Kelsay Hathaway said.
   
      Maxx, 35, was at Schemengees when the gunman attacked.
   
      His wife, Brenda Hathaway, was at the bar that night when her toddler, Lilian, started to get fussy. She told the Boston Globe that she left early while Maxx stayed behind to play pool.
   
      “With what support we can get, we would love to be able to provide Brenda with assistance for childcare, celebration of life, groceries, etc since she will soon have a new member of the family,” Kelsay wrote on the GoFundMe campaign.
   
      In a separate social media post, Hathaway’s other sister, Courtney Hathaway, said she’s shocked and heartbroken.
   
      “I lost my big brother in the tragic mass shooting last night. I’m feeling a lot of things right now but I’m mostly heartbroken that he’s gone. Nothing really prepares you for the sudden and shocking loss of a loved one, especially when it happens in such a tragedy,” Courtney Hathaway said in a Facebook post. “Maxx was such a loving person, and it really was something watching him become a father to two girls and there is one on the way. We’re all going to miss him.
   
      Bob Violette, 76, was teaching a youth bowling league at Just-In-Time Recreation when the gunfire broke out. His loved ones believe Violette died protecting his students from the bullets, according to CNN affiliate WBZ.
   
      “Bob’s helped with the youth league for as long as I can remember,” Violette’s friend Brandon Dubuc told WBZ. “If he was there with those kids, he was protecting those kids. I have no doubt about that.”
   
      Witnesses said Violette stood between the shooter and the children in his bowling league to keep them safe, according to the Portland Press Herald.
   
      “I was told that he got the worst of it, and that’s what really kills me – because he was trying to protect someone else,” his daughter-in-law Cassandra Violette told the Press Herald.
   
      Violette’s family described him to the Press Herald as a person who made everyone feel comfortable and cared for.
   
      He died days away from celebrating his 77th birthday, relatives told WBZ.
   
      Lucille Violette, 73, the wife of victim Bob Violette, was also identified as one of the victims in the shooting rampage, according to Department of Public Safety Commissioner Mike Sauschuck.
   
      Bill Young, a father who is described as the rock of the family, and his 14-year-old son, Aaron, were bowling together when they were both killed. 
   
      Young and his son were playing a game at Just-In-Time Recreation when the gunman entered the building, Aaron’s sister and Bill’s step-daughter Kayla Putnam told CNN affiliate WCVB.
   
      Aaron, who is missed dearly by his friends, was an honor student at school and was really proud of his grades, according to Putnam.
   
      Bill was an auto mechanic, Putnam said, and the rock of the family.
   
      “He’s going to be very missed,” Putnam told WCVB. “It’s going to be very hard for the family right now to deal without him because he was kind of the center of the family and everything,”
   
      Bill’s brother, Rob, described his older brother as a hardworking man who loved his family. “He was always trying to make people laugh and always enjoyed life to the fullest,” Rob said in a verified GoFundMe. “I couldn’t have asked for a better big brother.”
   
      Rob described his nephew Aaron, who was a sophomore in high school, as a gentle and thoughtful kid who enjoyed doing anything his father did.
   
      Ron Morin, 55, was at Schemengees Bar and Grille when the gunfire started. His death has left his family in “shock and profound grief,” his family member Cecile Francoeur Martin told CNN.
   
      Martin, the cousin of Morin’s wife, says the family is “asking for prayers and privacy during this incredible time of shock and profound grief.”
   
      In an interview with the Bangor Daily News, Martin described Morin as a gregarious, upbeat and happy person.
   
      Martin told the outlet Morin was “just one of those people that if you are having a bad day, he was going to make your day better just by his presence.”
   
      William Frank Brackett, 48, was identified as one of the victims in the shooting rampage, according to Department of Public Safety Commissioner Mike Sauschuck.

      Iranian teen Armita Geravand dies following alleged assault by morality police
    "," 
      A teenage Iranian girl who fell into a coma after she was allegedly assaulted by the country’s morality police for not wearing a headscarf has died, according to Iranian state media.
   
      “Unfortunately, the brain damage led to the victim spending some time in a coma and they died a few minutes ago,” the statement from IRNA said.
   
      Earlier this week, Armita was declared “brain dead” despite the efforts of medical staff to save her.
   
      Armita Geravand, 16, was hospitalized with head injuries following the alleged assault at a Tehran metro station earlier this month, according to activists, just weeks after Iran passed draconian legislation imposing much harsher penalties on women who breach the country’s already strict hijab rules.
   
      Earlier in October, the Norway-based Hengaw Organization for Human Rights, which focuses on Kurdish rights, said Geravand was “assaulted” by morality police and fell into a coma.
   
      Another opposition network, IranWire, said Geravand was admitted to the hospital with “head trauma.”
   
      Hengaw staffer Awyer Shekhi previously told CNN that female morality police officers had approached Geravand near the Shohada metro station and asked her to adjust her hijab.
   
      “This request resulted in an altercation with the morality police officers physically assaulting Geravand. She was pushed, leading to her collapse,” Shekhi said.
   
      CNN could not verify the information published by Hengaw and Iranwire, who have in the past covered Iranian protests extensively.
   
      Iranian authorities have denied the allegations, saying Geravand was hospitalized due to an injury caused by low blood pressure.
   
      Geravand’s friends and family have echoed those denials in interviews with state media, though it is unclear if they were coerced into doing so. UN officials and rights groups have previously accused Iranian authorities of pressuring families of killed protesters to make statements supportive of the government narrative.
   
      Iran’s parliament in September passed a so-called “hijab bill” on the wearing of clothing – which if violated can carry up to 10 years in prison – following the first anniversary of mass protests sparked by the death of Mahsa Amini.
   
      Amini, a 22-year-old Kurdish-Iranian woman, died last September after being detained by the regime’s infamous morality police, allegedly for not abiding by the country’s conservative dress code.

      Mike Johnson is well within the mainstream of today’s GOP
    "," 
      Republicans’ long public nightmare came to an end this past week when Louisiana’s Mike Johnson became the 56th speaker of the House. If you’re like most people who claim to be smart about politics, you immediately pretended to know who he was and then went to Google him.
   
      This has led to a bit of a debate about Johnson’s ideological record. Just how conservative is he? A look at the data reveals that Johnson is most certainly well to the right of the median American voter. But he is actually fairly close to the center of a Republican Party that has shifted further right in recent years.
   
      Consider what most people have learned about Johnson: He is an ardent defender of former President Donald Trump and was a key figure in the efforts to overturn the 2020 election.
   
Joe Biden, of course, was the legitimate winner of that election, and there is no real proof that he wasn’t. Most general election voters agree that Biden won the election legitimately. A recent ABC News/Washington Post poll found that just 29% of registered voters feel he didn’t.
   
      Among Republicans, however, 60% of them said Biden’s win wasn’t legitimate, according to that same poll. Only 23% disagreed.
   
      Meanwhile, the overwhelming majority of Republicans (70%) in a recent CNN/SSRS survey indicated that the criminal charges Trump faces over his failed attempts to overturn the 2020 election are not relevant to his fitness to serve another term. Even among the general electorate, just 49% said it should be disqualifying.
   
      Indeed, we can’t forget that a clear majority of House Republicans (139 of them, including Johnson) voted against certifying 2020 election results from at least one state. Their votes were outside the mainstream among all House members but not within the House Republican Conference.
   
      The same is true for an amicus brief that Johnson led supporting an effort to get the Supreme Court to overturn the 2020 election results in four Biden-won states. Most House members didn’t sign. A majority of House Republican members (126) did.
   
      The fact is, whether you like it or not, arguing that Biden was the rightful winner of the 2020 election is the minority point of view among Republicans today.
   
      Johnson has also faced criticism for his position on abortion. He co-sponsored a bill to prohibit abortions once a fetal heartbeat is detected, usually around six weeks.
   
      A May Gallup poll found that 59% of Americans were opposed to such legislation, with 37% in favor. This lines up with the pro-abortion rights side winning every abortion-related ballot measure since Roe v. Wade was overturned last year, including in several red states.
   
      But take a look at what that same poll found among Republicans: A majority (61%) wanted abortion banned after six weeks. Johnson, again, is within the mainstream of his party.
   
      Legislatively, most Southern states have enacted bans on abortion at six weeks or even earlier.
   
      I could go on and on about Johnson’s record on different issues that many object to, and we’ll find fairly consistently that while he may not be with the median general election voter, he is with the median Republican voter.
   
      This is best seen through aggregate statistics compiled by the academics at Voteview. Since entering the House in 2017, Johnson has built a voting record that is more conservative than 81% of all members currently serving. He is, however, only more conservative than 63% of his GOP colleagues. In other words, 37% of House Republicans are more conservative than the new speaker. That puts Johnson right in the middle third of today’s House Republican Conference.
   
      In fact, Johnson has voted with the Republican majority 94% of the time this Congress. That almost matches the median House Republican member (93%).
   
      To put that in perspective, take a look at failed speaker hopeful Jim Jordan. The Ohio congressman’s voting record is more conservative than 91% of other House Republicans. Unlike Johnson, Jordan really is out of the mainstream not just within Congress overall but the House Republican Conference, as well.
   
      This isn’t to say that Johnson isn’t more conservative than the Republicans of yesteryear. It’s just that Republicans, as a whole, have become more conservative.
   
      For example, Kentucky Rep. Hal Rogers, who was first elected in 1980 and is the longest-serving House Republican incumbent, was more conservative than 59% of GOP members during his first term. He’s more moderate than over 80% of House Republicans today.
   
      And Republican members of Congress remain representative of their voters. According to a 1982 CBS News poll, less than 50% of adults who self-identified as Republican called themselves conservative. This past year, Gallup has found that over 70% of Republicans say they are conservative.
   
      Of course, polls also show that Democrats have become considerably more liberal over the same stretch. As a result, independents, who are about as likely to identify as moderate as they were 40 years ago, probably feel like neither party represents them.
   
      But there are no independents in the House. There are Democrats and Republicans. And it’s in this political universe where someone like Johnson could have attained the House speakership. He’s simply emblematic of today’s GOP.

      Mike Johnson is well within the mainstream of today’s GOP
    "," 
      Republicans’ long public nightmare came to an end this past week when Louisiana’s Mike Johnson became the 56th speaker of the House. If you’re like most people who claim to be smart about politics, you immediately pretended to know who he was and then went to Google him.
   
      This has led to a bit of a debate about Johnson’s ideological record. Just how conservative is he? A look at the data reveals that Johnson is most certainly well to the right of the median American voter. But he is actually fairly close to the center of a Republican Party that has shifted further right in recent years.
   
      Consider what most people have learned about Johnson: He is an ardent defender of former President Donald Trump and was a key figure in the efforts to overturn the 2020 election.
   
Joe Biden, of course, was the legitimate winner of that election, and there is no real proof that he wasn’t. Most general election voters agree that Biden won the election legitimately. A recent ABC News/Washington Post poll found that just 29% of registered voters feel he didn’t.
   
      Among Republicans, however, 60% of them said Biden’s win wasn’t legitimate, according to that same poll. Only 23% disagreed.
   
      Meanwhile, the overwhelming majority of Republicans (70%) in a recent CNN/SSRS survey indicated that the criminal charges Trump faces over his failed attempts to overturn the 2020 election are not relevant to his fitness to serve another term. Even among the general electorate, just 49% said it should be disqualifying.
   
      Indeed, we can’t forget that a clear majority of House Republicans (139 of them, including Johnson) voted against certifying 2020 election results from at least one state. Their votes were outside the mainstream among all House members but not within the House Republican Conference.
   
      The same is true for an amicus brief that Johnson led supporting an effort to get the Supreme Court to overturn the 2020 election results in four Biden-won states. Most House members didn’t sign. A majority of House Republican members (126) did.
   
      The fact is, whether you like it or not, arguing that Biden was the rightful winner of the 2020 election is the minority point of view among Republicans today.
   
      Johnson has also faced criticism for his position on abortion. He co-sponsored a bill to prohibit abortions once a fetal heartbeat is detected, usually around six weeks.
   
      A May Gallup poll found that 59% of Americans were opposed to such legislation, with 37% in favor. This lines up with the pro-abortion rights side winning every abortion-related ballot measure since Roe v. Wade was overturned last year, including in several red states.
   
      But take a look at what that same poll found among Republicans: A majority (61%) wanted abortion banned after six weeks. Johnson, again, is within the mainstream of his party.
   
      Legislatively, most Southern states have enacted bans on abortion at six weeks or even earlier.
   
      I could go on and on about Johnson’s record on different issues that many object to, and we’ll find fairly consistently that while he may not be with the median general election voter, he is with the median Republican voter.
   
      This is best seen through aggregate statistics compiled by the academics at Voteview. Since entering the House in 2017, Johnson has built a voting record that is more conservative than 81% of all members currently serving. He is, however, only more conservative than 63% of his GOP colleagues. In other words, 37% of House Republicans are more conservative than the new speaker. That puts Johnson right in the middle third of today’s House Republican Conference.
   
      In fact, Johnson has voted with the Republican majority 94% of the time this Congress. That almost matches the median House Republican member (93%).
   
      To put that in perspective, take a look at failed speaker hopeful Jim Jordan. The Ohio congressman’s voting record is more conservative than 91% of other House Republicans. Unlike Johnson, Jordan really is out of the mainstream not just within Congress overall but the House Republican Conference, as well.
   
      This isn’t to say that Johnson isn’t more conservative than the Republicans of yesteryear. It’s just that Republicans, as a whole, have become more conservative.
   
      For example, Kentucky Rep. Hal Rogers, who was first elected in 1980 and is the longest-serving House Republican incumbent, was more conservative than 59% of GOP members during his first term. He’s more moderate than over 80% of House Republicans today.
   
      And Republican members of Congress remain representative of their voters. According to a 1982 CBS News poll, less than 50% of adults who self-identified as Republican called themselves conservative. This past year, Gallup has found that over 70% of Republicans say they are conservative.
   
      Of course, polls also show that Democrats have become considerably more liberal over the same stretch. As a result, independents, who are about as likely to identify as moderate as they were 40 years ago, probably feel like neither party represents them.
   
      But there are no independents in the House. There are Democrats and Republicans. And it’s in this political universe where someone like Johnson could have attained the House speakership. He’s simply emblematic of today’s GOP.

      Why teachers in South Korea are scared of their pupils – and their parents

      When fighting broke out in Kang Hyeon-joo’s elementary school classroom, her heart would beat so fast she could not breathe and her vision would blur.
   
      “They were throwing punches and kicking faces, throwing chairs and tables around,” she recalled, adding she had been hurt trying to intervene.
   
      For two years, Kang struggled to discipline her students – or cope with the parental backlash when she did. She claims her principal did nothing to help and would tell her simply to “just take a week off”.
   
      The strain took a dangerous toll. Kang says she started feeling the urge to jump in front of a bus. “If I just jumped at least, I would feel some relief. If I just jumped off a tall building, that would at least give me some peace.” 
   
      Kang is currently on sick leave but is far from alone in her experiences.
   
      Tens of thousands of teachers have been protesting in recent months, calling for more protection from students and parents. At one protest in Seoul last month, 200,000 gathered, according to organizers, forcing the government to take notice and action.
   
      The unified stand by the country’s teaching staff comes after the suicide of a first-grade teacher, in her early 20s, in July. She was found dead in her classroom in Seoul. Police have mentioned a problematic student and parental pressure while discussing her case, but have not given a definitive reason for her suicide.
   
      Several more teachers have taken their own lives since July and some of these cases have reportedly been linked to school stress, according to colleagues of the deceased and bereaved families.  
   
      Government data shows 100 public school teachers killed themselves from January 2018 to June 2023, 11 of them in the first six months of this year, but does not specify what factors contributed to their deaths.
   
      Sung Youl-kwan, a professor of education at Kyung Hee University, says the speed and size of the protests took many by surprise. “I think there has been like a shared feeling that this can happen to me too,” he said.
   
      Teachers point to a 2014 child abuse law, intended to protect children, as one of the main reasons they feel unable to discipline students. They say they are fearful of being sued by a small percentage of parents for causing emotional distress to their child and being dragged through the courts.
   
      “School is the last barrier to let students know what is okay in society and what is not. But we couldn’t do anything, if we teach them, we could be accused,” said Ahn Ji-hye, an elementary school teacher who helped organize previous protests.
   
      Ahn says parents have called her mobile phone some days from 6 a.m. until 11 p.m., wanting to talk about their child or complain.
   
      South Korea’s education minister Lee Ju-ho initially warned teachers that a mass strike would be an illegal act. That position was swiftly reversed, and a set of legal revisions passed the National Assembly on September 21, a fast piece of legislation.
   
      One of the key changes is providing teachers some protection from being sued for child abuse if their discipline is considered a legitimate educational activity. Also, the responsibility for handling school complaints and lawsuits brought by parents now rests with the principal. 
   
      “So far we have a culture where the school principal tended to pass those responsibilities to teachers,” said Professor Sung.
   
      The new law will also protect teachers’ personal information, such as their mobile phone numbers, and require parents to contact the school with concerns or complaints rather than the teacher directly.
   
      In the past, Ahn said, “If I could not give my personal phone number to them, sometimes some parents would come to the parking lot and watch and see and take a note of my phone number from my car, then they would text message me.” It is customary for Koreans to display their phone number in the bottom corner of their windscreen.
   
      Ahn welcomes the legal changes as “meaningful,” but insists higher-level laws like the Child Welfare Act and Child Abuse Punishment Act also need to be revised. “It is still possible to report teachers based on suspicion alone according to these laws,” she said.
   
      She says that, for now at least, the protests will continue. 
   
      One is planned for outside the National Assembly on October 28. Ahn says she would like to see penalties for parents who make unfounded accusations against teachers or practical measures put in place so that mandated changes can be adopted in classrooms, such as removing a disruptive student elsewhere to allow teaching to continue.
   
      Professor Sung believes the revisions will help in the short term, but cautions that the law should be seen as a safety net not a solution.
   
      Critics say South Korean society places a disproportionate level of importance on academic success so it should not be surprising that parents put teachers – and the wider education system – under so much pressure.
   
      It is the norm for students to attend a cram school, called hagwon, after their regular school hours, not as an extra but as a basic and expensive requirement to succeed. 
   
      On the day of the national college entrance exam, known as Suneung in Korean, airplanes are grounded, and commuting hours are adjusted to ensure that students taking the exams are not disturbed.
   
      “We have a culture in which parents have usually one child and they are ready to pour every financial resource and opportunity into this child,” Sung said. 
   
      “This pressure or obsession with education, sometimes with a high score, high achievement (mindset), is not a good environment for teachers (because) they are taking the pressure from the parents.”
   
      Sung says the days of a teacher being automatically respected are long gone, not just in South Korea but elsewhere in the world, and the teacher-parent dynamic is unrecognizable from just a decade or two ago.    
   
      “In educational policies, parents are regarded as like a consumer, with consumer sovereignty, and school and teachers are regarded as service providers”, he said, adding parents believe they “have the right to demand many things from schools.”
   
      In a country where education is considered central to success, teacher satisfaction is low. A survey by the Federation of Teachers’ Labor Union in April found 26.5% of teachers polled said they had received counseling or treatment for psychological issues due to their job. Some 87% said they have considered moving job or quitting in the past year.

      A hidden feedback loop under Antarctica’s glaciers could accelerate sea level rise, scientists find
    "," 
      Glaciers in East Antarctica could lose ice faster in the future than previously thought, scientists reported Friday, in an alarming feedback loop where glacier meltwater is triggering even more ice loss and sea level rise as the planet warms.
   
      The findings come less than a week after scientists reported rapid melting of West Antarctica’s ice shelves may now be unavoidable, thanks to human-caused global warming. Together, these and other recent studies paint a dire picture of a melting southern continent that poses extreme risk of life-altering sea level rise around the world.
   
      “This paper shows that it’s not only bad, but it’s even worse than we thought,” said Jamin Greenbaum, co-author of the study and assistant research geophysicist at the University of California San Diego’s Scripps Institution of Oceanography.
   
      The study, published Friday in the journal Science Advances, focused on the Denman and Scott glaciers in East Antarctica that together hold enough ice to trigger roughly five feet of sea level rise.
   
      Previous studies have shown that as glaciers melt, the water flows underneath them and out to sea – a process that enhances glacial melting and ice loss. Friday’s study factored that feedback into simulations to see how much it could accelerate Antarctic melting and sea level rise.
   
      Scientists found the glaciers could retreat past a critical threshold about 25 years earlier than they would have without the meltwater discharge, if the world burns planet-warming fossil fuel at an accelerated rate.
   
      Adding the meltwater feedback increased the sea level rise from the Denman and Scott glaciers by nearly 16% by the end of 2300 under this scenario of high levels of planet-heating pollution.
   
      Importantly, Greenbaum said, the extra ice loss from meltwater discharge is currently excluded from climate models projecting sea level rise, despite the fact that it could be a major driver of ice loss across the whole continent. Measuring this phenomenon and accounting for it in climate models is necessary “to get a realistic picture of global sea level rise,” Greenbaum said.
   
      Tyler Pelle, lead author of the study and postdoctoral researcher at Scripps, said people need to pay attention to this part of the world as East Antarctica becomes more unstable, posing a higher risk of sea level rise for coastal communities and low-lying island nations.
   
      “These are huge ice masses that we previously thought were stable, and now we have all of this evidence from coastal observations showing that these glaciers have been in patterns of retreat for quite a long time now,” Pelle told CNN. “That makes it very worth the attention.”
   
      People’s lives are at stake, researchers say.
   
      While people alive today may not experience the devastating impacts from this melting, Pelle said the actions taken today seal the fate of future generations.
   
      “What we emit now is going to be impacting climate for generations to come,” Pelle said. “What we do today does have an impact on what the Earth is going to look like in 2100 or 2300, even if we’re not on this Earth anymore.”
   
      Jan De Rydt, associate professor of polar glaciology and oceanography at Northumbria University, who was not involved with the study, said the researchers make “a strong argument” for why subglacial discharge needs to be accounted for in all simulations of Antarctic ice loss.
   
      “Given this evidence, subglacial melt and discharge is a process that can no longer be ignored in future projections of Antarctica’s contribution to sea level rise,” De Rydt told CNN.
   
      While the researchers only used a present-day simulation for the study, which led to conservative results, Greenbaum said they plan to go back on the field to analyze the depths of the ice sheet and the ocean to truly understand what the future holds.
   
      “The least-explored part of Antarctica is the most important to observing and monitoring,” he said. “That’s a huge problem, that’s like yell it from rooftops, and it’s something that our group is really focused on.”

      Republicans return to ‘fizzled’ Biden impeachment inquiry following 3-week speaker race
    "," 
(CNN) - While the weekslong speaker fight consumed public attention, the House Republican-led committees leading the impeachment inquiry into President Joe Biden continued to work behind the scenes, holding a string of highly anticipated closed-door interviews and receiving more bank records from Hunter and James Biden.
   
      But now that Speaker Mike Johnson, a member of the House Judiciary Committee, has been elected, Republicans have the tall task of creating public momentum for an effort that has yet to resonate beyond its far-right base and present evidence that rises to the level of impeachment.
   
      The inquiry into the president was off to a rocky start before former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy was ousted, but the three weeks of infighting culminating in Republicans electing Johnson have left in its wake an entirely new landscape, exacerbating divisions in the GOP conference and cutting down the legislative calendar to a point where the entire Republican agenda beyond essential functions such as funding the government has lost momentum.
   
      “We wasted 22 days,” said House Ways and Means Chairman Jason Smith, a Republican from Missouri who leads one of the panels tasked with the inquiry.
   
      The prospect of when the inquiry can be finished is also thrown into question given the speaker’s race ate up so much of the legislative calendar.
   
      Another unknown factor is how House Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan – who spent much of the last three weeks running for speaker – will return to the scene. Republicans have long relied on Jordan to be their top messenger on hot button issues, but the unwavering opposition Jordan faced from a significant portion of his colleagues exposed the limitations of his reach in the conference.
   
      Over the course of the three weeks without a speaker, Republican staff with the House Oversight and Judiciary committees maintained that their work was still in full swing. Judiciary spokesman Russell Dye said in a statement to CNN that the inquiry has “ramped up” over the past few weeks from conducting interviews, reviewing bank records and compiling testimony and documents “for future public consumption,” adding “nothing has slowed us down.”
   
      On Monday, when eight candidates, including Johnson, presented their pitch to be speaker, none of them highlighted the inquiry as a priority, multiple lawmakers in the room told CNN. Johnson though has long been a proponent of the inquiry, is in regular contact with Jordan, and told CNN earlier this month he met with Oversight Chairman James Comer, a Kentucky Republican, in the midst of the speaker’s race when Jordan was still a candidate for an update on Oversight’s work. And some members from the far right say since he is coming from the Judiciary panel, Johnson is best situated to give the inquiry the proper attention and focus.
   
      The new speaker told Fox News’ Sean Hannity in a Thursday interview that House Republicans will continue to follow the facts and said, “the evidence is coming together.”
   
      “If, in fact, all the evidence leads to where we believe it will, that’s very likely impeachable offenses,” Johnson said.
   
      While he acknowledged that some in his party are getting “anxious” and “restless” because “they just want somebody to be impeached,” he stressed that any articles must be based on evidence.
   
      A source familiar with Johnson’s thinking told CNN, “He believes it’s a fact-finding mission. And he trusts Comer, Jordan and Smith to finalize their investigations, give him a recommendation and he supports the chairmen.”
   
      House Judiciary Committee member Rep. Jeff Van Drew acknowledged to CNN on Thursday that the prolonged speaker’s battle has made the inquiry “fizzled a little.”
   
      “That slowed things down,” the New Jersey Republican said of the speaker’s race impact on the inquiry. “That was one of my concerns with the entire issue of speaker. The longer we went without one, the more that this would become problematic.”
   
      That reality is making it even more difficult to get swing district Republicans, many of whom were already skeptical of the inquiry and are now preoccupied with keeping the government open past November 17, onboard with the effort.
   
      GOP Rep. Jen Kiggans, who represents a Virginia district Biden won in 2020, told CNN, “We have so much work we need to get done including these appropriations bills. Let’s focus on that first.”
   
      “Do I think that the American people, you know, the majority of American people, actually put that on the front-burner and prioritize that right now? I don’t think so,” GOP Rep. Mike Garcia, who represents a competitive district in California, told CNN of the inquiry. “I think we need to get the trains back on the rail and get our government running again, avoid a shutdown, fund the government. And then look at those things.”
   
      Even Rep. Ralph Norman, a conservative hardliner from South Carolina, posed to CNN, “Have the facts increased? I would make the argument that they did. And so, the public needs to know it. Now, I don’t know whether we can pass it in here or not.”
   
      And while a number of Republicans want the panels to continue their investigative work, they recognize it is not the top priority of the conference.
   
      “I do think that James Comer and Jim Jordan will continue with their investigations and if they’re able to bring forward enough evidence that we can convince the Americans that there is the need for impeachment, then at that stage I would think we would move forward,” GOP Rep. Austin Scott of Georgia told CNN. “But right now, it’s about making sure we don’t end up in a shutdown and continuing to get the appropriations measures passed. So, I think the investigations continue, but it’s not a front burner issue for me.”
   
      CNN has reached out to the White House for comment.
   
      House Republicans have not held an impeachment inquiry hearing since their first one on September 28, where expert witnesses brought in by Republicans acknowledged they did not yet have the evidence to prove the accusations leveled against the president.
   
      “When you’re at bat, you get more than on swing,” Van Drew said of the first hearing. “I don’t know that every hearing is going to show what we want.”
   
      After that hearing, GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida congratulated a number of Democratic lawmakers on their performance against Republicans on the House floor, multiple sources told CNN.
   
      “They think the hearing was a dumpster fire,” one Democratic lawmaker who spoke to Republicans shared with CNN.
   
      The House Oversight Committee was at one point looking at bringing in Hunter Biden business associate Tony Bobulinski in October at a second inquiry hearing, a source familiar told CNN, but those plans have yet to come to fruition.
   
      Now that a new speaker is elected, Democrats are also expected to try to invalidate the impeachment inquiry since it was unilaterally started under McCarthy and never received an official floor vote, a Democratic aide familiar with the plans told CNN.
   
      GOP Rep. Ken Buck of Colorado, who serves on the Judiciary panel and has said he does not believe there is evidence to impeach the president, told CNN that the way the House Oversight and Judiciary panels have operated behind the scenes during the three weeks without a speaker proved why an inquiry was not necessary from the beginning.
   
      “That was the reason why I was saying there wasn’t a need to call it an impeachment inquiry because these committees were moving forward,” Buck said. “They continue to move forward, and as they gather evidence, we will see if there’s that connection.”
   
      Judiciary Committee member GOP Rep. Chip Roy of Texas told CNN that the inquiry “might have been paused for a week or so” while Jordan was running for speaker but insisted “we’re doing a lot of work.”
   
      The dueling demands have meant that members may have been less involved, even if committee staff plows ahead. For example, while the Judiciary Committee was conducting a voluntary transcribed interview with California US Attorney Martin Estrada on Tuesday to discuss his involvement in the Hunter Biden criminal case, Jordan was stuck in yet another member forum as the conference was trying to elect a new speaker nominee.
   
      As news broke that Jordan’s panel had secured an unprecedented, closed-door interview with special counsel David Weiss about his ongoing criminal probe into Hunter Biden, the culmination of months of back and forth with the Department of Justice, Jordan was meeting with holdouts who were blocking his bid for speaker.
   
      Still, his allies feel confident that Jordan can rise to the occasion.
   
      “Chairman Jordan is an indispensable leader on the Judiciary Committee,” fellow Judiciary committee member Rep. Ben Cline of Virginia said after Jordan’s bid for speaker ended. “I think Jordan is going to be needed in his role as judiciary chair in the next several months to come.”
   
      Gaetz, who led the effort to oust McCarthy, told CNN that he feels more comfortable having Johnson in the speaker chair handling the inquiry than McCarthy and drew this comparison of the two: “I think the impeachment inquiry would benefit from having a skilled lawyer in the speaker’s office rather than a California lottery winner.”

      Jenni Hermoso scores the winner on triumphant Spain return after unwanted kiss
    "," 
      Spain’s Jenni Hermoso scored a late winning goal on Friday in a glorious return to the national team following the unwanted kiss controversy that overshadowed La Roja’s World Cup win in August.
   
      The forward struck a left-footed drive in the 89th minute to give the world champions a 1-0 victory after coming on as a second half substitute in the UEFA Women’s Nations League match against Italy in Salerno.
   
      Television broadcasts showed traveling Spanish fans jumping for joy as Hermoso was surrounded by her celebrating teammates.
   
      “When Italy sat deep, we needed someone like Jenni to step up with her shooting boots,” Spain’s head coach Montse Tomé said after the game. “That Jenni scored the goal makes us all very happy. We’ve seen her smile and she’s everyone’s smile.”
   
      Hermoso, 33, who plays for Mexican club Pachuca Femenil, was not part of the Spain squad for their previous two games against Sweden and Switzerland in September. Tomé had explained her absence by saying she wanted to protect the star.
   
      Hermoso received an outpouring of global support after Spanish Football Federation President Luis Rubiales forcibly kissed her during the medal ceremony following Spain’s Women’s World Cup final victory over England in Sydney two months ago.
   
      The fallout over Rubiales’ behavior triggered a crisis in Spanish soccer and sparked condemnation in Spain and across the world.
   
      Following weeks of fierce criticism, Rubiales, 46, resigned last month as the country’s soccer president. He is now under investigation for “the crimes of sexual assault and coercion,” in a case being brought by Spanish prosecutors.
   
      Rubiales’ actions partly “ruined” the tournament and “derailed” Spain’s joyous celebrations, a senior official at soccer’s governing body FIFA said.
   
      “I didn’t take one second to realize that, oh, that was very inappropriate,” FIFA’s outgoing Secretary General Fatma Samoura told CNN Senior Sports Analyst Darren Lewis at the recent Best of Africa Awards in London.
   
      Spain next travel to Switzerland on October 31.

      A day after Palestinian militant group Hamas launched its brutal attack on Israel, a curious video emerged out of Tehran’s Azadi stadium. Hundreds of soccer fans, gathered to watch a match between Perspolis FC and Gol Gohar Sirjan FC, chanted in unison: “Shove the Palestinian flag up your a**.”
   
      The vulgar protest came in response to officials attempting to raise a Palestinian flag in the stadium to show support for the October 7 attack. But for the fans, it was another unwelcome mixing of politics and soccer, and a stark reminder of the Iranian government’s involvement in proxy battles in far-flung arenas.
   
      Hamas’ attack, which killed 1,400 people according to Israeli authorities, prompted a fierce aerial campaign on Gaza that has so far killed more than 7,000 people, according to the health ministry in Hamas-controlled Gaza. And there are now concerns that more fronts will open in the war, including one with Iran.
   
      Experts say that while Iran is wary of being dragged into the Israel-Hamas war, it may not be in full control if the militias it backs in the region independently intervene as Hamas suffers heavy blows and the death toll in Gaza continues to mount.
   
      “What connects all these groups to Iran is their anti-Israel policies,” said Sima Shine, head of the Iran program at the Institute for National Security Studies (INSS) in Tel Aviv, noting that while Iran has varying levels of influence over the groups, it doesn’t dictate all their actions.
   
      In the early days after the October 7 attack, questions were raised about Iran’s potential involvement in the killings. Tehran at the time commended the operation but was quick to deny any hand in it . Initial US intelligence also suggested that Iranian officials were surprised by Hamas’ attack, and that Tehran was not directly involved in its planning, resourcing or approval, CNN has reported.
 
      Despite its denial, however, Iran has ramped up its rhetoric against its arch enemy.
   
      Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian has warned that Israel’s bombardment of Gaza could have far-reaching consequences, saying that if Israel does not halt its airstrikes, “it is highly probable that many other fronts will be opened.”
   
      “This option is not ruled out and this is becoming increasingly more probable,” he told Al Jazeera last week.
   
      On Monday Abdollahian said the US has sent Iran two messages regarding escalation in the region.
   
      “The first message said that the United States is not interested in expanding the war, and the second message asked Iran to have self-restraint and insisted that Iran should also ask other countries and other sides to have self-restraint,” Abdollahian said during a news conference in Tehran Monday, without saying how and when the messages were delivered.
   
      He added that while the US says it wants to de-escalate, it has contradicted itself by continuing to support Israel.
   
      Trita Parsi, vice-president of the Quincy Institute in Washington, DC, said there is no appetite or desire from either Iran, the US or Israel for a wider war, but that Washington’s failure to restrain Israel may inadvertently drive the region towards escalation.
   
      US President Joe Biden last week pledged continued support for Israel, which has hardened Arab sentiment across the region and translated to mass protests against Israeli and American policies.
   
      “The only actor that has a clear interest in (a wider conflict) is Hamas, given that an enlargement of the war could change the dynamics in a favorable way for them,” Parsi said. In the absence of US efforts to rein in Israel, “many (regional) actors are going to feel compelled to step in… because of their own strategic calculations.”
   
      “When Israel is mobilizing 300,000 (troops), it is not likely that Hezbollah is going to sit there and assume that this is done only to go after Hamas,” he said, adding that it will factor in the risk of Israel going after the Lebanese group as well.
   
      An Iran-backed armed group and powerful regional force, Hezbollah has been trading fire with Israel’s military since the October 7 attack by Hamas. The fighting has been the worst since the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war, but it has so far been restricted to the border between Lebanon and Israel.
   
      Israel’s defense minister last week said that Israel was not interested in another war with Hezbollah. Israel has nonetheless turned the area of 4-kilometer radius near its border into a closed military zone, and evacuated residents from 28 communities within 2 kilometers of the Lebanese border.
   
      Hezbollah’s influence spans beyond Lebanon, however. It also operates alongside Iran’s elite Revolutionary Guard Corps in Syria, where the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights separates Israel from Tehran-aligned fighters.
   
      The Lebanese group also has its own channels with Hamas. Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah met Wednesday with top officials from Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, it said in a statement, without revealing where the meeting took place.
   
      “An assessment was made of…what the parties of the resistance axis must do at this sensitive stage to achieve a real victory for the resistance in Gaza and Palestine and to stop the treacherous and brutal aggression against our people,” it said.
   
      The Hamas-Israel conflict has also led to skirmishes in Syria and Iraq, from which Iran-backed militias have launched multiple drone attacks on US forces. And the US now has specific intelligence that those same groups could escalate even further as the war between Israel and Hamas continues, CNN reported this week.
 
      The US continues to warn Tehran against taking advantage of the current situation or encouraging its proxies to escalate. On Tuesday, Secretary of State Antony Blinken urged the United Nations Security Council to warn Iran against any further involvement.
   
      “Tell Iran, tell its proxies in public, in private, through every means: Do not open another front against Israel in this conflict. Do not attack Israel’s partners,” Blinken said, noting that a “broader conflict would be devastating, not only for Palestinians and Israelis, but for people across the region, and indeed, around the world.”
   
      The US on Thursday carried out airstrikes targeting two facilities linked to Iranian-backed militias in eastern Syria, according to a statement from Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin. The strikes came after a series of drone and rocket attacks against US forces in the region. The statement said the targeted facilities have been used by Iran’s IRGC and affiliated groups.
   
      Shine, of the INSS, said that Iran does not want a direct war with Israel because that would mean a direct war with the US. “It is very obvious that Iran does not want to be directly involved, and would prefer that (only) the proxies are involved.”
   
      But that may not play out exactly how Iran wants, added Shine, who previously served in the Israeli intelligence community for most of her career.
   
      “Iran has to take into account that the world is not operating according to what Iran decides or wants,” she told CNN. “So, if they decide to use their proxies too much, they might find themselves in a war they don’t want.”
   
      Parsi of the Quincy Institute said that the Iranian government is nonetheless preparing its population for war.
   
      Iranian media has been brimming with news of the Gaza war, with officials across Iran’s political spectrum expressing solidarity with Palestinians.
   
      “They’re already preparing the public opinion for this eventuality by essentially trying to make the argument that this is something that is brought to their doorstep because of what the Israelis are doing and because of the American support for it,” Parsi said.
   
      This shows there are already concerns in the Iranian government about how citizens will react to a war in which Iran is directly involved, he added.
   
      Even if there is a widener war that is still “below the threshold of a direct US-Iran engagement” – where it is restricted to Iranian proxies fighting Israel – it would still be an extremely unstable situation, he said. “No one can even control the current situation and make sure it doesn’t escalate.”

      Rugby World Cup final: Inspirational South Africa captain Siya Kolisi chases history against New Zealand
    "," 
South Africa and New Zealand will meet on Saturday in a Rugby World Cup final for the first time since 1995.
   
      On that occasion, it was tournament host South Africa which won a close-fought contest 15-12 to lift the Webb Ellis Cup for the first time.
   
      After the end of the apartheid era, this was a victory that saw South African President Nelson Mandela present the trophy to Springboks captain Francois Pienaar. Mandela dressed in a replica of Pienaar’s No. 6 shirt is one of the most iconic images in sporting history – a powerful, symbolic moment as a nation attempted to reconcile with its divisive past.
   
      Twenty-four years on from that enduring moment, it was the inspiring Siya Kolisi who led his country to victory in the 2019 final against England, becoming the first Black captain to lead South Africa to World Cup glory.
   
      Born amid desperate poverty in the township of Zwide, just outside Port Elizabeth, Kolisi is the embodiment of the impossible dream to so many in his homeland and beyond.
   
      Indeed, his participation in this year’s World Cup is also nothing short of remarkable. In April, he suffered a serious knee injury and underwent surgery before battling back to fitness.
   
      A devout Christian, Kolisi later acknowledged the importance his strong faith played in his recovery. He now has the chance to join All Blacks great Richie McCaw as the only captain to win consecutive tournaments.
   
      “I don’t think that it’s stuff that you can dream about because it doesn’t happen often,” said the 32-year-old, per Reuters, ahead of a game in which both countries are seeking to win the coveted title for a record fourth time.
   
      “I don’t think it will happen in our lifetime again, two teams like this. It will probably be the biggest game of my life,” added Kolisi.
   
      The Springboks superstar knows his team is carrying the hopes of a nation. “People send us videos and tell us this is sometimes the only time they are happy about something. It’s when we play,” the flanker reflected.
   
      “When we play or when you then get selected, you know it’s for something far bigger than yourself.”
   
      Lining up alongside Kolisi on Saturday will be Bongi Mbonambi after World Rugby opted to not charge the Springboks hooker for alleged use of discriminatory language against England’s Tom Curry in the semifinal due to “insufficient evidence.”
   
      Kolisi revealed he’d reached out to Curry following the abuse and threats the Englishman and his family have received online.
   
      “I have been through it too. We can take it as players. When it comes to us directly, it’s fine, but when it comes to your family, it’s totally different,” the South African captain said. “It’s the one part of the game that we really don’t enjoy.”
   
      While New Zealand has won the last three times these two countries have faced each other at a Rugby World Cup, the Kiwis will remember all too well what happened when they met in August, as the now top-ranked South Africa inflicted a record 35-7 defeat on the All Blacks at Twickenham Stadium in London.
   
      Unwisely written off by some after losing its tournament opener to France, New Zealand is looking to be crowned world champion for the first time since 2015.
   
      There’s disappointment though for the most-capped All Black of them all, Sam Whitelock, who drops to the bench in his final game for New Zealand.
   
      Whitelock is one of several Kiwi stars calling time on their international careers after the tournament, but the 35-year-old knows he has the chance to become the sport’s first three-time champion.
   
      This will also be the last match as head coach for Ian Foster in what has become an unlikely title chance for New Zealand.
   
      During Foster’s tenure, the All Blacks have suffered 11 defeats and two draws over the last four years, though the 58-year-old coach has guided the nation to four Rugby Championships triumphs.
   
      “So we’ve woken up this week and we’re in a World Cup final and we’re excited and, right now, we’re trying to make sure we balance the control of the emotion of it versus dealing with all the messages from home and even people in France have been massive,” Foster told reporters.
   
      “We know it’s two great teams out there. Different styles. They’re great at their style, we want to be great at ours,” added Foster.
   
      A trio of Barrett brothers – Scott, Jordie and Beauden – will start the game for the three-time winner, while winger Will Jordan knows he can achieve a new mark for most tries at a World Cup if he can add to the eight he already has.
   
      After almost two months of intense, gripping action, we now have a World Cup final re-match 28 years in the making as the two top-ranked teams in the world battle it out in front of 80,000 fans at the Stade de France in Paris as they chase a special piece of history.

      ‘Parasites’: Mother wins court case to evict two sons in their 40s
    "," 
      A mother’s love does have limits, it seems. At least for a 75-year-old woman in the northern Italian city of Pavia who won a court order after suing to have her sons, aged 40 and 42, removed from her house, a court clerk in Pavia told CNN Friday.
   
      The two sons, described in court papers by their mother as “parasites,” had been living in the family apartment without contributing financially or helping around the house, according to the complaint filed by the woman, who has not been named, in a the Tribunal of Pavia district court. Both men are employed, the court documents state.
   
      Judge Simona Caterbi sided with the retired mother, who is separated from the men’s father and whose pension went entirely on food and maintenance of the home, ruling that the two “bamboccioni,” or big babies, have until December 18 to vacate the premises, according to Tuesday’s court ruling, seen by CNN.
   
      Caterbi wrote: “There is no provision in the legislation which attributes to the adult child the unconditional right to remain in the home exclusively owned by the parents, against their will and by virtue of the family bond alone.”
   
      The men, who hired lawyers to fight the maternal eviction, according to the local newspaper La Provincia Pavese, argued that Italian parents are required by law to take care of their children as long as necessary.
   
      Caterbi cited the existing law in her ruling and agreed that “the stay in the property could initially be considered well founded because the law is based on the maintenance obligation incumbent on the parent.”
   
      She then ruled that “it no longer appears justifiable considering the two defendants are subjects over 40 and once a certain age has been exceeded, the child can no longer expect the parents to continue the maintenance obligation beyond limits that are no longer reasonable.”
   
      A lawyer for the men told local media that the men had not decided if they would appeal the court decision.
   
      This is not the first time “mammoni,” an Italian term used to describe adult men who are too dependent on their mothers, has cropped up in the legal system.
   
      In 2020, Italy’s Supreme Court ruled against a 35-year-old man who worked as a part-time music teacher who still expected financial support from his parents after he argued that he could not support himself on an annual salary of 20,000 euros ($21,100).
   
      On average, Italians leave their parental home at the average age of 30, according to Eurostat 2022 data. Croatia is the highest in the European Union, with an average age of 33.4 years. By contrast, offspring in Finland, Sweden and Denmark start life on their own at the average age of 21, according to the same data.

      Chinese fighter jet got within 10 feet of US bomber over South China Sea, US military says
    "," 
      A Chinese fighter jet came within 10 feet of a US Air Force B-52 bomber flying over the South China Sea on Tuesday, according to the US military.
   
      The Chinese pilot “flew in an unsafe and unprofessional manner, demonstrated poor airmanship by closing with uncontrolled excessive speed, flying below, in front of, and within 10 feet of the B-52, putting both aircraft in danger of collision,” US Indo-Pacific Command said in a Thursday statement. “We are concerned this pilot was unaware of how close he came to causing a collision.”
   
      News of the latest Chinese intercept comes as President Joe Biden is expected to speak with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi when he visits the White House on Friday, CNN reported on Thursday. It is not clear whether the meeting will be a formal discussion or a more informal meet and greet. Wang is also expected to meet with Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Thursday and national security adviser Jake Sullivan on Friday.
   
      Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping may also meet on the sidelines of the APEC Summit in San Francisco next month, though neither side has confirmed finalized plans.
   
      The US and China on Thursday both released footage accusing each other of provocative maneuvers in and around the South China Sea, escalating tensions over the disputed waterway.
   
      China’s Defense Ministry released a video during a regular press briefing, saying the USS Ralph Johnson “conducted close-in harassment” against a Chinese navy task group doing routine training in the South China Sea on August 19.
   
      Chinese Defense Ministry spokesman Wu Qian said the video “shows that the US side is the real provoker, risk-taker and disrupter.” Wu said the US warship’s actions “endanger China’s national security” and added China would “take all necessary measures to resolutely safeguard national sovereignty.
   
      “US fighter jets coming all the way to flex their muscles at our doorstep is the root cause of aviation and maritime safety risks,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said in response to a question for comment on the incident during a regular briefing on Friday.
   
      The Pentagon’s top official in charge of security in the Indo-Pacific, Ely Ratner, said earlier this month that the US has seen more instances of “coercive and risky” behavior from Chinese pilots against US aircraft in the last two years over the East and South China Seas than in the entire decade before that.
   
      “Since the fall of 2021, we have seen more than 180 such incidents,” Ratner said. “It’s a centralized and concerted campaign to perform these risky behaviors in order to coerce a change in lawful US operational activity.”
   
      The Pentagon’s efforts this year to engage with Chinese military leadership have gone unanswered, and US officials have grown increasingly concerned about the lack of military-to-military dialogue between the countries. Beijing cut off the communications after then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan last year, infuriating Chinese leaders.
   
      “I’ve asked to speak with my counterparts, the eastern and southern theater commanders now, going on two and a half years,” INDOPACOM commander Adm. John Aquilino said earlier this month. “I have yet to have one of those requests accepted.”
   
      As part of the latest National Defense Strategy, the US has pointed to China as the “pacing challenge,” capable of competing with America in terms of its military might, economic power and international reach. Beijing already possesses a standing army of more than one million soldiers, the largest navy in the world by number of ships and the largest air force in the region.
   
      Beijing claims “indisputable sovereignty” over almost all of the South China Sea, and uses its military might to assert its claims of sovereignty in the disputed waters and beyond, including Taiwan.
   
      In 2022, the Chinese military increased its aggressive actions towards the island, including ballistic missile overflights, military aircraft flying into Taiwan’s aerial identification zone and major exercises near Taiwan. Though Xi has said he is seeking the peaceful unification of Taiwan with China, he has not renounced the use of military force to achieve his goal.

      Earth’s core is leaking, scientists say

      Scientists have detected a surprising amount of a rare version of helium, called helium-3, in volcanic rocks on Canada’s Baffin Island, lending support to the theory that the noble gas is leaking from Earth’s core — and has been for millennia.
   
      The research team also detected helium-4 within the rocks.
   
      While helium-4 is common on Earth, helium-3 is more readily found elsewhere in the cosmos, which is why scientists were surprised to detect a larger amount of the element than had been previously reported from the rocks on Baffin Island. A study describing the discovery published recently in the journal Nature.
   
      “At the most basic level, there is little 3He (helium-3) in the universe compared to 4He (helium-4),” said lead study author Forrest Horton, associate scientist in the department of geology and geophysics at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, in an email.
   
      “3He is rare in Earth because it has not been produced in or added to the planet in significant quantities and it is lost to space,” Horton added. “As Earth’s rocky portion stirs and convects like hot water on a stove top, material ascends, cools, and sinks.During the cooling stage, helium is lost to the atmosphere and then to space.”
   
      Detecting elements that leak from Earth’s core can help scientists unlock insights into how our planet formed and evolved over time, and the new findings provide evidence to bolster an existing hypothesis about how our planet came to be.
   
      Baffin Island, located in the territory of Nunavut, is the largest island in Canada. It’s also the fifth-largest island in the world.
   
      A high ratio of helium-3 to helium-4 was first detected in Baffin Island volcanic rocks by Solveigh Lass-Evans as part of her doctoral studies under the supervision of University of Edinburgh scientist Finlay Stuart. Their findings were published in Nature in 2003.
   
      The composition of a planet is a reflection of the elements that formed it, and previous research found that trace amounts of helium-3 leaking from Earth’s core supports the popular theory that our planet originated in a solar nebula — a cloud of gas and dust that likely collapsed due to the shock wave of a nearby supernova — which contained the element.
   
      Horton and his colleagues took it a step further when they conducted research on Baffin Island in 2018, studying the lava that erupted millions of years ago when Greenland and North America split apart, making way for a new seafloor. They wanted to investigate the rocks that may contain insights about the contents locked within Earth’s core and mantle, the mostly solid layer of Earth’s interior located beneath its surface.
   
      The researchers traveled by helicopter to reach the remote, otherworldly landscape of the island, where lava flows have formed towering cliffs, giant icebergs float by and polar bears stalk the coastline. Local organizations, including the Qikiqtani Inuit Association and Nunavut Research Institute, provided the researchers with access, advice and protection from the bears, Horton said.
   
      “This area on Baffin Island holds special importance both as sacred lands for the local communities and as a scientific window into the deep Earth,” he said.
   
      The Arctic rocks that Horton and his team investigated revealed surprisingly higher measurements of helium-3 and helium-4 than was reported by previous research, and the measurements varied among the samples they collected.
   
      “Many of the lavas are full of bright green olivine (also known as the gemstone peridot), so breaking off fresh pieces with a rock hammer was as thrilling as breaking apart geodes as a kid: each rock was a treasure to be discovered,” Horton said. “And what scientific treasures they turned out to be!”
   
      Only about one helium-3 atom exists for every million helium-4 atoms, Horton said. The team measured about 10 million helium-3 atoms per gram of olivine crystals.
   
      “Our high 3He/4He measurements imply that gases, presumably inherited from the solar nebula during solar system formation, are better preserved in Earth than previously thought,” he said.
   
      But how did the helium-3 end up in the rocks in the first place?
   
      The answer may begin as far back as the big bang, which, when it created the universe, also released an abundance of hydrogen and helium. These elements were incorporated into the formation of galaxies over time.
   
      Scientists believe our solar system formed 4.5 billion years ago within a solar nebula. As the dust cloud collapsed in a supernova, the resulting material formed a spinning disk that eventually gave rise to our sun and the planets, according to NASA.
   
      Helium inherited from the solar nebula likely became locked in Earth’s core as the planet formed, making the core a reservoir of noble gases. As helium-3 leaked from the core, it ascended to the surface through the mantle in the form of magma plumes that eventually erupted on Baffin Island.
   
      “During the eruption, the vast majority of the gases in the magma escaped to the atmosphere,” Horton said. “Only the olivine crystals that grew prior to eruption trapped and preserved the helium from the deep Earth.”
   
      The new research supports the idea that helium-3 is leaking from Earth’s core and has been for some time, but the researchers aren’t entirely sure when this process began.
   
      “The lavas are about 60 million years old, and the ascent of the mantle plume took perhaps tens of millions of years,” Horton said. “So, the helium we measured in these rocks would have escaped the core perhaps 100 million years ago or possibly much earlier.”
   
      Helium leaking from Earth’s core doesn’t affect our planet or have any negative implications, he said. The noble gas does not chemically react with matter, so it won’t have an impact on humanity or the environment.
   
      Next, the research team wants to investigate whether the core is a storehouse of other light elements, which could account for the why Earth’s outer core is less dense than expected.
   
      “Is the core a major repository of elements like carbon and hydrogen, which are so important in terms of planetary habitability? If so, have fluxes of these elements from the core over (Earth’s) history influenced planetary evolution? I am excited to investigate links between helium and other light elements,” Horton said. “Perhaps helium can be used to track other elements across the core-mantle boundary.”

      ‘Tombstone tourists’ find the beauty and joy in cemetery visits
    "," 
      Until she left for college, film historian Karie Bible spent almost her entire childhood living next to a cemetery.
   
      It’s where the Texas native rode her bike, played with her brother and passed by nearly every day. Other kids may have traded creepy stories about cemeteries or swore they’re haunted, but Bible was convinced of their value.
   
      “Being right next to a cemetery was normal for me,” she told CNN. “I always thought they were extremely beautiful.”
   
      Years later, after landing in Los Angeles as an adult, she ended up in one of the most famous cemeteries in the country: Hollywood Forever, a paean to Old Hollywood and the people who built it. There, visiting the graves of silent film star Marion Davies, famed director Cecil B. DeMille and ingénue icon Judy Garland, she found countless stories to tell.
   
      That was more than 20 years ago. She’s been the cemetery’s official tour guide ever since, leading visitors on monthly treks across the grounds to visit elaborate mausoleums, humbler headstones and various tributes to major stars and Hollywood everymen.
   
      “I love these people, and it gives me so much joy to keep their memories alive and their legacies going,” she told CNN.
   
      Bible spends her days with “tombstone tourists” — fans of cemeteries who travel across the country and world to significant cemeteries to commune with those buried there and bask in the history. (Philip Stone, founder and executive director of the Institute of Dark Tourism Research at the University of Central Lancashire in the United Kingdom, likened tombstone tourism to “sightseeing the mansions of the dead.”)
   
      Cemeteries aren’t conventional tourist destinations, but they’ve become essential stops for history buffs, aesthetes and curious visitors looking to learn more about the community they’re visiting. And “tombstone tourists” are always encouraging more to consider a cemetery’s the macabre beauty.
   
      “For me, a cemetery is like an art museum,” said Joy Neighbors, an author who writes  about her cemetery obsession in the blog A Grave Interest. “It’s always an adventure and always an experience to go in, dig around and see what you can find.”
   
      People often visit cemeteries for a connection to the past and to probe their own interest in death and the afterlife, said Sue Slocum, an associate professor of hospitality at George Mason University.
   
      Cemetery tourism is considered a form of “dark tourism,” or travel that involves visiting sites associated with death, she said. Dark tourism is predicated on a “preoccupation with death,” she said.
   
      “These are things that are part of being human,” said Slocum, who’s currently teaching a course on the subject. “(Cemeteries) celebrate community and the people buried there.”
   
      For the history-curious, cemeteries are rich resources. Tombstones themselves are monuments to the past and to the people buried beneath them, Neighbors said. Their design tells stories about the era in which they were produced — if it’s elaborate and well-kept, for example, it may mark the grave of a well-known and wealthy community member.
   
      Symbols on gravestones tell stories, too: In the 19th and 20th centuries, it was common for gravestones to bear symbols of religion or groups to which they belonged, like the Masonic square and compass. Children are often represented by lambs, Neighbors said, and some tombstones resemble trees from which limbs are cut, symbols of the deaths of family members.
   
      Even the birth and death dates can tell rich, devastating stories without words, she said.
   
      “It really makes you respect your heritage and the past,” Neighbors said.
   
      Many gravesites have become popular tourist destinations for their architecture, famous “residents” or historic significance: The Bonaventure Cemetery in Savannah, Georgia, is the Southern Gothic home to hundreds of Confederate soldiers and men who fought in the Spanish-American War, along with members of Savannah’s prominent 19th-century families. St. Mary Magdalene Churchyard in East Ham outside of London was a Roman burial site, discovered in the 19th century after hundreds of years of dormancy. And New Orleans’ St. Louis Cemetery No. 1 is home to dozens of locals who’ve since become urban legends, such as Voodoo queen Marie Laveau.
   
      “Cemeteries kind of have personalities,” Bible said. “They all have their own set of history and style — none of them are really the same experience.”
   
      In some places, Neighbors said, cemeteries function almost like parks: In Edinburgh, Scotland, the Greyfriars Kirkyard cemetery is open 24 hours a day, and people visit to knit, read, eat lunch and meet friends around its historic tombstones. (It’s also the home of the memorial for Greyfriars Bobby, a terrier who was said to have stood guard at his owner’s grave for 14 years. Visitors often bring him a stick to play fetch, Neighbors said — a way to “draw people in” to a cemetery instead of casting them out.)
   
      “To me, that’s what a cemetery should be,” she said.
   
      Bible sees her fair share of unruly cemetery guests: “There’s a reason why they have bike racks around Jim Morrison’s (grave),” she said, noting the barriers at Père Lachaise cemetery in Paris that surround The Doors’ frontman’s headstone.
   
      She has sympathy, though, for people whose interest in cemeteries is complicated. Sometimes, a visit to a cemetery can revive painful memories or pangs of grief for a lost loved one, she said.
   
      Cemeteries have often been considered places of quiet reverence, not venues for tourism or leisure. It’s a “very American concept” to maintain an air of solemnity in cemeteries, Slocum said. For years it was considered almost “sacrilegious to (visit) just to enjoy it,” Neighbors said.
   
      “You held your breath when you passed the cemetery,” Neighbors said of her grandparents’ view.
   
      Increasingly, though, historic cemeteries across the country and world are encouraging visitors to tour the grounds and learn the stories of the people buried there. Neighbors said she’s noticed families, joggers, even musicians start to spend time regularly at her local cemeteries when that was rare even 10 years ago. Some, like Atlanta’s Oakland Cemetery, have become community hubs where people walk their dogs or picnic — not just tourist destinations but resident mainstays.
   
      “People started realizing this is a gorgeous location we can utilize for other things than just visiting the dead,” Neighbors said. “There’s a wealth of experiences waiting to be discovered.”
   
      “There is a way to maintain your respect and curiosity,” Bible said of visiting a cemetery. “I think if you go in with the right attitude and realize why you’re there, there’s absolutely a way.”
   
Go with a purpose. 
 
      Cemeteries are sites for reflection and remembrance, not so much for littering, loitering or partying like the doomed teens of many a scary story. While you can visit public cemeteries on your own, many offer tours to teach visitors about its history and some of the people buried there — Slocum suggested taking a guided tour of a cemetery to get the most out of the experience.
   
Respect the space. 
 
      Even some of the best-known gravesites are working cemeteries, like Hollywood Forever, which still hosts funerals and performs burials and cremation services. It’s best to enter cemeteries, even those that offer tours or events, peacefully in case there are active funereal services taking place, Bible said.
   
      So, even on a tour themed to Halloween that leans into the spookier elements of cemeteries, it’s important to maintain “common decency for the dead, victims and their families,” Stone said.
   
Don’t tread where unwelcome.
 
      Not all cemeteries appreciate guests. If a gravesite is private or culturally significant and discourages visiting if you’re not a community member, it’s best to heed that guidance, Slocum said.

Don’t tread where unwelcome.
 
      Not all cemeteries appreciate guests. If a gravesite is private or culturally significant and discourages visiting if you’re not a community member, it’s best to heed that guidance, Slocum said.

      The 2023 world cheese champion has been revealed
    "," 
      A Norwegian blue cheese bested contenders from around the world Friday to become the world’s new No. 1 cheese.
   
      The cheese, Nidelven Blå from cheesemaker Gangstad Gårdsysteri, vied against the crème de la crème of the cheese world in Trondheim, Norway, in the world’s largest global cheese event.
   
      Organized by the Guild of Fine Food, the World Cheese Awards, now in its 35th edition, saw experts from across the globe join forces to crown this year’s champion.
   
      And 2023 marked a record-breaking year for the competition, with 4,502 cheeses, the highest number ever, arriving “by boat, truck, train and plane” to be judged by an esteemed panel of cheese experts.
   
      After a long day of deliberations, this year’s winner was finally chosen in front of a live audience by a carefully assembled “super jury,” including the Ambassador of Food Culture at Whole Foods Market in the US, after the entrants had been whittled down to a final 16.
   
      “We’re a small dairy farm based just two hours from here, so this happening on our home turf means a lot, and having all of the crew from the dairy here adds an extra spark to it,” said Maren Gangstadt, general manager of Gangstadt Gårdsysteri, in a statement.
   
      The judges had delectable things to say about Nidelven Blå, a semi-solid, blue mold cheese, made with pasteurized cows’ milk.
   
      “It has this sort of short creaminess, like real dense fudginess,” said one judge. Another called it “the perfect blue cheese.”
   
      A third remarked on its balance and “fruity overtones, maybe some wine-like characteristics that really speak. It’s a very unique language.”
   
      The winning cheese had to speak up against fierce global competition.
   
      “Competition is always stiff in the World Cheese Awards,” John Farrand, managing director of the World Cheese Awards, told CNN Travel ahead of the event.
   
      “Effectively, we have over 40 different countries competing. So therefore, you’re expecting the best quality cheeses from those countries.”
   
      The proceedings got underway at the Trondheim Spektrum indoor arena on Friday morning, when the wider judging panel, made up of 264 leading cheese experts, began assessing between 40 to 50 cheeses across around 100 tables, working in teams of two to three.
   
      “What we ask them to do, quite simply, is to assess the visual aspects of the cheese and then the aroma of the cheese,” says Farrand.
   
      “And then there’s a sort of heavier weighting in the scoring for the taste and mouthfeel of the cheese. So they’re looking at all aspects of it and how that sort of marries together.”
   
      Once each group had come to an agreement, the top choices were awarded gold, silver or bronze status, with each judging table selecting one as a “super gold.”
   
      The next stage of the competition saw the “super gold” champions whittled down to a final 16, by the Super Jury, made up of a team of 16 experts, who went on to debate the finalists, with Nidelven Blå coming out on top.
   
      “The cheese community is a strong one,” says Farron. “They [the judges] do enjoy it. They have fun.
   
      “But ultimately it’s a pretty serious job. Because for the small cheesemakers who win awards, it can just make such a big contribution to the success and growth of their business.”
   
      Host country Norway had its highest ever number of entries, 293, this year.
   
      According to Farron, the World Cheese Awards has grown from roughly 250 “majority UK entries” when it began in 1988, to 4,502 entries from 43 different countries across the world this year.
   
      “We really do have cheeses from around the world,” he adds, explaining that the team works hard to ensure that the awards are accessible to smaller artisan cheesemakers so that the line-up is as eclectic as possible.
   
      “We’ve got some really interesting cheeses this year from India and Japan that have only very recently been allowed, in the last two or three years, into the awards.
   
      “But equally our judges like to find old favorites.”
   
In 2022, the coveted award went to Swiss cheese maker Vorderfultigen and affineur (refiner) Gourmino’s Le Gruyère AOP surchoix.

      Norway’s fastest – and most famous – running family is ripped apart by allegations of ‘aggression and physical punishment’
    "," 
      In a quiet corner of a Tokyo stadium, a father wipes tears away from his eyes. He has just watched his 20-year-old son win a first Olympic gold in thrilling fashion, patiently chasing down and passing fierce Kenyan rival Timothy Cheruiyot on the final bend of the 1,500-meter final.
   
      The moment would be an emotional one for any parent, but even more so if you have coached your son throughout his running career. Such was the case for Gjert Ingebrigtsen, who was the coach to three of his seven children: Henrik, Filip and Jakob, the one who raced to Olympic gold in Tokyo two years ago.
   
      Today, however, the family dynamic has shifted. The three running brothers ended their coaching relationship with their father last year, prompting a swathe of speculation about a potential rift in Norway’s fastest – and most famous – sporting family.
   
      Now the three brothers have spoken publicly about the reasons for no longer being coached by their father, alleging that he is aggressive, controlling and has used physical violence and threats towards them.
   
      “We still feel discomfort and fear, which lays within us since childhood,” Henrik, Filip, and Jakob wrote in a story for Norwegian newspaper VG, which was published last week.
   
      “Somehow, we have accepted this. We have lived with it, and in adult age we have moved on. At least we thought so. In retrospect, we realize that it was naive.”
   
      They said that two years ago, a few months before ending their coaching relationship with their father, “the same aggression and physical punishment struck again. That was the final straw.”
   
      Gjert Ingebrigtsen has denied these accusations. In comments sent to CNN Sport via his legal representative, Elden Advokatfirma, he said: “The statements that my sons made are baseless. I have never used violence against my children.
   
      “That I have had weaknesses as a father, and have been too much of a coach, is a realization I have also come to – albeit far too late.”
   
      On Thursday, Norwegian police said that they had carried out “preliminary investigations” into the brothers’ allegations and have now opened a case under a criminal code relating to “abuse in close relationships.”
   
      In a statement shared with CNN Sport, inspector Terese Braut Våge said: “This means that we are now in an investigation phase, where the purpose of the investigation is to uncover whether there are criminal circumstances.”
   
      John Christian Elden, the lawyer representing Gjert, told CNN Sport that his client has not yet been charged with any criminal offense.
   
      “This was not unexpected, and my client is confident of the outcome of such an investigation,” said Elden, adding that it is Gjert’s “only opportunity to be cleared of any wrongdoing.”
   
      The brothers’ account of their relationship with their father in VG did not provide details about specific instances of abuse or physical violence. And days after the story was published, another Ingebrigtsen brother, Martin, who is not a professional athlete, defended Gjert, telling VG: “Fortunately, fear is an unknown feeling to me. I never feared dad.
   
      “I must honestly admit that I find it difficult to see this great fear, when others in the family are constantly visiting and have recently been on holiday with Gjert.”
   
      In an interview with the New York Times last year, Jakob spoke about the tension within the family, saying: “Our father is really anxious and that affects everybody around him. And that quickly evolves to anger towards competitions. Because he’s anxious and he has nerves and he responds by getting irritated and angry about the little stuff.”
   
      CNN has contacted representatives for the Ingebrigtsen brothers for further comment.
   
      Henrik, 32, Filip, 30, and Jakob, 23, are all decorated middle and long-distance runners. Jakob, however, is the family’s most successful athlete, winning world and Olympic titles and setting indoor records over 1,500m and 2,000m.
   
      “Jakob is one of the best and biggest athletes in Norway – like [soccer players] Erling Haaland and Martin Ødegaard, or [golfer] Viktor Hovland,” Herman Folvik, a sports journalist for VG, told CNN Sport.
   
      But it’s not for their running prowess alone that the brothers have gained celebrity status in Norway. Team Ingebrigtsen, a documentary series first aired in 2016, has shed light on the family dynamic, particularly the father-coach relationship between Gjert and his sons.
   
      “I would say that after the royal family, I think they are the most famous family in Norway,” said Folvik. “[The documentary] about the running brothers and Gjert also got really close to the mother [Tone] and the other siblings.”
   
      The brothers and Gjert announced their split in February 2022, less than a year after Jakob had won gold at the Tokyo Olympics.
   
      In their story in VG, which was published on October 19, Henrik, Filip, and Jakob explained how media scrutiny of their relationship with Gjert had compelled them to speak publicly about their family environment.
   
      “When we broke with Gjert, we thought we would be able to handle the situation in an orderly manner, without mentioning the underlying circumstances,” they said.
   
      “We now realize that is not possible. This matter has become so inflamed, and has had such great consequences, that we feel a responsibility to clean it up.”
   
      They described the situation as a “family conflict” and said that they now hope to achieve “peace for all parties.”
   
      In his comments to CNN Sport, Gjert lamented the “tragic situation” for the Ingebrigtsens.
   
      “Our family has lived in the public spotlight for many years, and we have chosen to let the public into our lives through TV series, interviews and much more,” he said.
   
      “That violence should have occurred in this public family life is unthinkable. The Norwegian people have seen our lives, for better or for worse … I don’t know how we’re going to get past this – but we have to try.”
   
      The situation between the father and his three sons is complicated by the fact that Gjert is currently coaching another Norwegian athlete, Narve Gilje Nordås, who won a bronze medal in the 1,500 meters at this year’s world championships – finishing fractionally behind Jakob.
   
      The Norwegian Athletics Federation has recently said that Gjert would not be granted accreditation as a coach for international competitions – next year’s world indoor championships and European championships.
   
      In two separate statements, the federation said that it wants to create a “safe environment” for athletes and made reference to comments made by the Ingebrigtsen brothers in the media. It also said that it would recommend that Gjert would not receive accreditation for next year’s Paris Olympics.
   
      Nordås, meanwhile, has said that he plans to make a statement in the coming days. He has called the situation absurd and said he continues to train with Gjert.
   
      As for Jakob, he is essentially self-coached but continues to lean on his older brothers for advice. Still arguably the most dominant middle-distance runner in the world, he holds lofty ambitions for his track and field career.
   
      “I don’t want to sound immodest,” he said in an interview earlier this year, “but my main goal is to become the best runner of all time, for which I still have a lot of work to do.”

      Ghana plunged into darkness amid country’s economic woes
    "," 
      Large swaths of Ghana are facing power blackouts due to gas shortages at a major power facility, the nation’s power operator said, compounding the country’s worst economic crisis in decades.
   
      “Limited gas supply” at a power installation in Tema, located east of the Ghanian capital, Accra, has led to “a supply gap of 550MW at peak time,” the Ghana Grid Company (GRIDCo) said of the power outages in a statement Thursday evening.
   
      Ghana partly relies on natural gas for power generation. The West African nation has battled power outages, known locally as “dumsor” for many years.
   
      “Dumsor is fully back, no announced timetables, no communication, nothing, just frequent random power outages,” one Ghanian said of the latest power cut on X, formerly known as Twitter.
   
      GRIDCo did not say in its statement when electricity would be restored to affected areas. CNN has reached out to the agency for further comment.
   
      Recent studies expect the country’s energy crisis to worsen over the coming years, starting from this year.
   
      “Ghana’s energy supply requires urgent, purposeful and significant investment to undo the current precarious situation the country finds itself,” said research and policy think tank, Centre for Socioeconomic Studies (CSS).

      Ghana plunged into darkness amid country’s economic woes
    "," 
      Large swaths of Ghana are facing power blackouts due to gas shortages at a major power facility, the nation’s power operator said, compounding the country’s worst economic crisis in decades.
   
      “Limited gas supply” at a power installation in Tema, located east of the Ghanian capital, Accra, has led to “a supply gap of 550MW at peak time,” the Ghana Grid Company (GRIDCo) said of the power outages in a statement Thursday evening.
   
      Ghana partly relies on natural gas for power generation. The West African nation has battled power outages, known locally as “dumsor” for many years.
   
      “Dumsor is fully back, no announced timetables, no communication, nothing, just frequent random power outages,” one Ghanian said of the latest power cut on X, formerly known as Twitter.
   
      GRIDCo did not say in its statement when electricity would be restored to affected areas. CNN has reached out to the agency for further comment.
   
      Recent studies expect the country’s energy crisis to worsen over the coming years, starting from this year.
   
      “Ghana’s energy supply requires urgent, purposeful and significant investment to undo the current precarious situation the country finds itself,” said research and policy think tank, Centre for Socioeconomic Studies (CSS).
   
      A CSS study released in June said, “available data shows the country’s current energy provision is critically unhealthy and tottering towards a power crisis” and also “faces a dire energy situation from 2023 going into the near future.”

      Look of the Week: LeBron James flies the flag for the man bag
    "," 
  Editor’s Note: Featuring the good, the bad and the ugly, ‘Look of the Week’ is a regular series dedicated to unpacking the most talked about outfit of the last seven days.
 
      Four-time NBA champion LeBron James is the latest male celebrity to be spotted out and about wearing a high-fashion bag. On Tuesday, the 34-year-old professional basketball player arrived at the Ball Arena in Denver, Colorado for the latest LA Lakers game against Denver’s Nuggets. If James wanted to make a sartorial statement for his first game of the season, it came in the form of the forest green Speedy bag from Louis Vuitton which sat at his hip — one of the standout pieces from Pharell’s debut collection as creative director of menswear this summer.
   
      James paired the cross-body bag with a custom tweed “Damoflage” jacket (Pharell’s pixelated, Minecraft-esque print which has already become a brand motif, endorsed by Kim Kardashian and Rihanna), sunglasses and black derby shoes. He follows in the footsteps of several famous men of late who have been seen sporting not just any functional receptacle, but an “it bag.”
   
      This year, Australian actor Jacob Elordi (who is set to star as Elvis in Sofia Coppola’s forthcoming biopic “Priscilla”) has appeared with a series of highly coveted luxury bags slung over his shoulder including, but not limited to, a Bottega Veneta Cassette bag, a Chanel Mini Messenger, a Burberry Sanford leather tote, a Valentino Loco bag and a yellow version of James’ LV Speedy. “No one can separate Elordi from his fancy bags,” wrote one user on X.
   
      Similarly, fashion-forward musicians Tyler the Creator and A$AP Rocky are also batting for the man bag — Tyler has owned an turquoise quilted Chanel number since at least 2018, as well as a green Goyard trunk bag, while earlier this month A$AP was snapped rocking a Barbie-pink Bottega Andiamo.
   
      A gendered stigma has long been attached to men who wear shoulder bags, however. In series five, episode 13 of “Friends” (“The One with Joey’s Bag”), when Joey debuts a new leather tote bag, his masculinity and sexual orientation is persistently mocked by Chandler and Ross. Indeed, men wearing bags are consistently the butt of jokes in internet memes, comic strips, and even  stand-up comedy sets. “You better keep a gun in here bro,” comic Andrew Schulz told a male audience member who attended a 2019 show wearing a small leather satchel.
   
      But the tide is changing. In August, Pharrell told GQ Magazine that designing accessories was something he was eager to tackle in the Louis Vuitton top job. “One of the things I wanted to do when I got here was I definitely wanted to work on the bags,” he said. Doubtless it’s a dedication appreciated by the likes of James, Elordi, A$AP and Tyler, whose street style looks contribute further proof — were any needed — that man purses are enjoying a newfound socio-cultural appreciation. Because at the end of the day, manbags shouldn’t carry so much baggage.

      Molly Carlson was in a ‘dark place’ prior to Rio Olympics. Now she is inspiring millions to talk about mental health
    "," 
      For most people, jumping off a platform which hangs 66-feet in the air from a cliff with just deep open water below is a terrifying prospect, but for high diver and influencer Molly Carlson it is a chance to be free. It is her time to fly.
   
      For the self-described “professional athlete with anxiety,” these dizzying heights are where she feels most at peace. Cliff diving helped the 25-year-old recover from what she calls a “year from hell,” overcoming loneliness and a binge eating disorder. It is, she says, “almost like free therapy.”
   
      “I’ve enjoyed diving my whole life because it’s that one time where you have to be so in the moment to dive safely and to survive that you can’t be thinking of anything else,” she told CNN Sport.
   
      “My brain shuts out for the first time and it’s finally silence up here where I can enjoy what I’m doing.
   
      “When I’m cliff diving, nothing matters other than me and the air, really. It’s like you’re flying.”
   
      It is not just the spectacular high dives that make Carlson unique – the 25-year-old has gained almost four million followers on TikTok and over 250,000 followers on Instagram not only by documenting her career but also by talking openly about her mental health while encouraging others to do the same.
   
      “I have the biggest passion for mental health, and I’ve learned so much from my personal experience that now it’s kind of become like my future,” she said.
   
      “I really want to public speak to athletes on how to prioritize your self-care and ask for help when you need it, because I never want anyone to go through the year of hell that I went through and to feel isolated and alone.”
   
      Carlson refers to her lowest point as her “mental injury” and is unwaveringly direct about her immense personal battles, which include anxiety and body dysmorphia. Her journey to this more positive current stage has been arduous, but she is determined to support others.
   
      Born in Fort Frances, Ontario, Canada and raised in Thunder Bay, Carlson originally started out as a gymnast but soon turned her attention to the water, or rather, what was above the water.
   
      “My sister was a swimmer, and I would have to go and watch her practises and they were so boring,” said Carlson. “But in the corner of the pool was the dive team and they were jumping off these crazy heights. I looked at my mom and I was like, ‘I need to do this sport.’”
   
      She started diving aged nine and two years later was representing Canada, progressing quickly because, she says, she was a “little daredevil.”
   
      A decorated junior diver, Carlson won two Pan American Game titles and dived for Team Canada at Nanjing 2014 Youth Olympics.
   
      It is every athlete’s dream to represent their country at an Olympic Games, and Carlson was no exception, aspiring to compete on the biggest stage of all since she was four years old.
   
      However, her determination to make the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Games took a toll on the then 17-year-old. Making the Canadian team became her everything, leading her down a “dark path.”
   
      She developed a binge eating disorder and other mental health issues which stemmed, she said, from being taller than her diving peers.
   
      “I was 5-foot-8-inches, and my competitors were 5-foot-2-inches,” Carlson explained. “In my head, I was like, ‘I need to be smaller to go to the Olympics.’
   
      “Believing this negative thought led me down that dark path and I missed out on the Olympics – top two go and I was fourth place.”
   
      Falling short of a lifelong goal was a wake-up call. She “hated” herself at the time and realized that her love for diving was diminishing.
   
      “What I thought would have been devastation was relief,” she admitted. “It was the first time I realized ‘Okay, I do need help, and maybe if I ask for help, I can learn to love myself and diving all over again.’
   
      “It was a blessing in disguise not making that Olympic team.”
   
      Carlson continued diving at college, heading to Florida State University (FSU).
   
      Still on her path to recovery, she opened up to her diving coach, John Proctor, about her mental health as soon as she appeared on campus as she “did not want to start her four years at the university with a lie.” Proctor immediately put her in touch with a nutritionist and a mental health coach.
   
      That conversation left Carlson feeling empowered, she said, and was a catalyst for her success. She had a decorated career as a Florida State Seminole, winning NCAA All-American and Atlantic Coast Conference Diver of the Year honors three times.
   
      After her college career was put on hold by the pandemic, Proctor suggested the switch to high diving, in which you enter the water feet first, after indoor diving became impractical due to multiple wrist injuries.
   
      Initially apprehensive and seeking further opinions, Carlson put the question to her Instagram followers, posting a poll on her story asking if she should give cliff diving a try. The results were 99% in favor, with the lone vote against the idea coming from her mother.
   
      “Being the first in the world to do a lot of things does not sit easy with my mum,” Carlson laughed.
   
      “She couldn’t watch me do regular diving, she would wait to hear the clapping and then celebrate – ‘You didn’t even watch it!’
   
      “I send her videos just to build her confidence, but she’s physically been to an event and watch me do a dive, so that is progress.”
   
      After impressing during practise sessions, she was offered the opportunity to take part in the 2021 Red Bull Cliff Diving World Series as a wild card. Carlson finished second in her debut event, and third in the overall table that season.
   
      She improved the next year, this time on a full-time basis as one of 12 female professionals, placing second behind five-time winner Rhiannan Iffland. She is currently second in the championship heading into the final event next month.
   
      Carlson trains in Montreal, which houses a 20-meter indoor platform, the city where she “fell in love” with the sport.
   
      “[At first] My coach and I didn’t know what we were doing, because so few people do this sport that we were the guinea pigs,” she said “We were trying every dive ever, and some dives that we shouldn’t have been doing!”
   
      Alongside a successful start to her cliff diving career, Carlson has also built a substantial following on social media, where she documents her daily life to millions of people.
   
      The uniqueness of her content is what stands out: from standing on a podium with a medal around her neck to having a panic attack in the build-up of an important competition, Carlson shares her cliff diving and mental health journey in detail.
   
      Inspired by the conversation she had with her diving coach at college and her upbringing, where the “stigma around mental health was massive,” Carlson wants to use her platform to raise awareness about a taboo so many people are scared to talk about.
   
      “What I learned during my experience was as soon as you talk about mental health with one person, it becomes real,” Carlson said.
   
      “I used to think Instagram had to be perfect. I grew up when it came out and everything was a highlight of your life, and if it’s not your best moments, you can’t post it.
   
      “Every time I post that today is not a good day, I didn’t feel I was in the right mindset to do a dive from 66 feet, and I share that story with four million people and they’re like, ‘Wow, I didn’t know I could say no’, that’s so exciting.
   
      “When I’m vulnerable, I feel like I also help my followers to be vulnerable,” she added.
   
      After a 12-year-old girl messaged Carlson and shared her struggles to go to school because of her anxiety, the high diver realized the power her videos have on young people’s lives.
   
      “I feel like a mom watching my kids, it’s so inspirational,” Carlson said.
   
      “It reminds me that what I’m doing is impacting lives and I should keep going.”
   
      She is the founder of the #BraveGang – videos with this hashtag have over one billion views on TikTok. She describes the tag as a community where her followers can support each other by sharing their experiences about overcoming their fears and opening up about mental health.
   
      “Everyone has their own brave story,” Carlson believes.
   
      “#BraveGang started in the kitchen with my mum. I was brainstorming in my comments, the amount of times I read ‘brave,’ I was like, ‘We need to incorporate this.’
   
      “I told all my followers to use this hashtag to share their own brave story, and everyone in the community will be there to support you.
   
      “And it’s all these inspirational videos of little girls learning their first cartwheel or coming out to their parents – that’s such a big deal and they’re using my hashtag!”
   
      Dealing with fears is nothing new to the Canadian. Carlson grew up terrified of sharks and still struggles with the phobia to this day, despite regularly jumping into open water. She went shark cage diving in South Africa in an unsuccessful attempt to conquer her fears.
   
      “I will forever be scared,” she said.
   
      “I think it’s okay to have fears. If it was limiting me from actually jumping into the water and diving, then I would try to work on it.”
   
      Though it is yet to fully break into the mainstream, high diving is a growing sport.
   
      It made its debut at the World Aquatics Championships in 2013 and there were calls for it to be added to the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles, with Carlson one of the most vocal among them, though it was not one of the five new sports added to the program this month.
   
      “The more we go viral, the more people learn about this sport,” says Carlson. “We’ve created this excitement around the sport, and we’ve showed how fun it can really be.”
   
      For Carlson, competing in high diving at the Olympics would be more than just representing her country on the national stage.
   
      “It would be a full circle moment because when I was trying to achieve my dream of the Olympics back in 2016, I didn’t love myself and I wasn’t enjoying it. But now that I do love myself and I’ve worked on myself, it would show that you can love yourself and achieve your dreams.”
   
      Getting her sport into the Games is just one of the 25-year-old’s long-term ambitions – she aims to finally dethrone Iffland and clinch the World Series title, and wants to make a splash outside of the water as well.
   
      Making Brave Gang into its own brand and starting a foundation is a goal of hers, as is public speaking. She is just as focused on her legacy as she is on her next dive.
   
      “When I’m done diving, it doesn’t mean the Brave Gang’s over and I want to keep it alive as long as I can.”

      “[At first] My coach and I didn’t know what we were doing, because so few people do this sport that we were the guinea pigs,” she said “We were trying every dive ever, and some dives that we shouldn’t have been doing!”
   
      Alongside a successful start to her cliff diving career, Carlson has also built a substantial following on social media, where she documents her daily life to millions of people.
   
      The uniqueness of her content is what stands out: from standing on a podium with a medal around her neck to having a panic attack in the build-up of an important competition, Carlson shares her cliff diving and mental health journey in detail.
   
      Inspired by the conversation she had with her diving coach at college and her upbringing, where the “stigma around mental health was massive,” Carlson wants to use her platform to raise awareness about a taboo so many people are scared to talk about.
   
      “What I learned during my experience was as soon as you talk about mental health with one person, it becomes real,” Carlson said.
   
      “I used to think Instagram had to be perfect. I grew up when it came out and everything was a highlight of your life, and if it’s not your best moments, you can’t post it.
   
      “Every time I post that today is not a good day, I didn’t feel I was in the right mindset to do a dive from 66 feet, and I share that story with four million people and they’re like, ‘Wow, I didn’t know I could say no’, that’s so exciting.
   
      “When I’m vulnerable, I feel like I also help my followers to be vulnerable,” she added.
   
      After a 12-year-old girl messaged Carlson and shared her struggles to go to school because of her anxiety, the high diver realized the power her videos have on young people’s lives.
   
      “I feel like a mom watching my kids, it’s so inspirational,” Carlson said.
   
      “It reminds me that what I’m doing is impacting lives and I should keep going.”
   
      She is the founder of the #BraveGang – videos with this hashtag have over one billion views on TikTok. She describes the tag as a community where her followers can support each other by sharing their experiences about overcoming their fears and opening up about mental health.
   
      “Everyone has their own brave story,” Carlson believes.
   
      “#BraveGang started in the kitchen with my mum. I was brainstorming in my comments, the amount of times I read ‘brave,’ I was like, ‘We need to incorporate this.’
   
      “I told all my followers to use this hashtag to share their own brave story, and everyone in the community will be there to support you.
   
      “And it’s all these inspirational videos of little girls learning their first cartwheel or coming out to their parents – that’s such a big deal and they’re using my hashtag!”
   
      Dealing with fears is nothing new to the Canadian. Carlson grew up terrified of sharks and still struggles with the phobia to this day, despite regularly jumping into open water. She went shark cage diving in South Africa in an unsuccessful attempt to conquer her fears.
   
      “I will forever be scared,” she said.
   
      “I think it’s okay to have fears. If it was limiting me from actually jumping into the water and diving, then I would try to work on it.”
   
      Though it is yet to fully break into the mainstream, high diving is a growing sport.
   
      It made its debut at the World Aquatics Championships in 2013 and there were calls for it to be added to the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles, with Carlson one of the most vocal among them, though it was not one of the five new sports added to the program this month.
   
      “The more we go viral, the more people learn about this sport,” says Carlson. “We’ve created this excitement around the sport, and we’ve showed how fun it can really be.”
   
      For Carlson, competing in high diving at the Olympics would be more than just representing her country on the national stage.
   
      “It would be a full circle moment because when I was trying to achieve my dream of the Olympics back in 2016, I didn’t love myself and I wasn’t enjoying it. But now that I do love myself and I’ve worked on myself, it would show that you can love yourself and achieve your dreams.”
   
      Getting her sport into the Games is just one of the 25-year-old’s long-term ambitions – she aims to finally dethrone Iffland and clinch the World Series title, and wants to make a splash outside of the water as well.
   
      Making Brave Gang into its own brand and starting a foundation is a goal of hers, as is public speaking. She is just as focused on her legacy as she is on her next dive.
   
      “When I’m done diving, it doesn’t mean the Brave Gang’s over and I want to keep it alive as long as I can.”

      Halloween portraits on the New York City subway are a ‘fantastical ride’
    "," 
      Fluorescent lighting, dark tunnels, scurrying rats and questionable dripping: New York City’s subway stations could serve as a spooky backdrop on nearly any day, but around Halloween, the sprawling subterranean system comes alive with bustling costumed figures — all of whom have somewhere to be, thanks.
   
      For nearly two decades, one New York photographer, who goes by the artist name Seymour Licht, has documented spectral, peculiar and outlandish parade- and partygoers in transit across the city. In one photo, an imitator of surrealist artist Rene Magritte sits in a train car, holding a picture frame with an apple suspended above his face; in another, the dark-haired ghoulish Samara from the cult horror film “The Ring” waits underground for the next train to arrive.
   
      Now, Licht, has put together a book called “Halloween Underground,” timed to the 50th anniversary of the Village Halloween Parade.
   
      “I started with documentary (photography), just recording what I saw,” Licht said in a phone call. “And then I was so transfixed, that I wanted to elevate it and (make it) more magical and surreal.”
   
      Though Licht has photographed above-ground revelers, too, he found he was more drawn to the transitory themes unfolding as crowds moved through downtown hubs including Union Square and West 4th Street in Manhattan, and busy stations like Bedford Avenue in Brooklyn.
   
      “The subway is a liminal space, and Halloween is a liminal time,” he said, referring to its origins in Samhain, the ancient Gaelic festival that signaled the end of harvest season. “It’s the time when the dead come over to visit and mingle among the living.”
   
      Through his photos, one can chart changes to photography — Licht began with Fuji transparency film and shoots digitally now — updates to the subway and shifts in pop culture, too. There’s appearances by classic horror villains Pennywise and Michael Myers, glittering angels, a 6-foot-tall frog prince, and the married foxes from the 2009 Wes Anderson adaptation of “Fantastic Mr. Fox” among others.
   
      One unfortunate trend Licht has noticed, however? A drop in the complexity and originality of many ensembles.
   
      “I think the more elaborate costumes, where you see people put a lot of thought and time in it, are a little bit more uncommon,” he said of recent years.
   
      Twenty years on, Licht ultimately views the work as a “fantastical ride” through the underbelly of the city.
   
      “The wonderful thing about Halloween is that people generally are game for everything for anything,” he said. “They’re out there to have a good time. There is an air are being like a little bit mischievous and playful.”

      Taylor Swift is now a billionaire, Bloomberg says
    "," 
      Taylor Swift has another accolade to add to her lengthy resume this year: America’s favorite pop star is now a billionaire, according to a Bloomberg analysis.
   
      The outlet, which runs the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, said Swift’s total net worth is now at $1.1 billion, thanks to a record-breaking Eras tour that helped boost the US economy this summer.
   
      Bloomberg said Swift is one of the few entertainers to reach that status based on just her music and performance.
   
      Chris Leyden, director of growth marketing at SeatGeek, previously told CNN that “Taylor Swift’s ‘Eras’ tour is rewriting the playbook of entertainment economics.”
   
      “She’s not just a performer — she’s an economic phenomenon,” Leyden said.
   
      Swift has dominated not only Super Bowl-sized arenas, but local movie theaters as well. In its opening weekend, the pop singer’s concert film, “Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour,” raked in about $96 million in the box office in the United States and Canada, making it the highest-groatssing concert film domestically for an opening weekend, according to AMC.
   
      The Eras tour could gross $2.2 billion in North American ticket sales alone, according to August survey data from research firm QuestionPro provided to CNN exclusively. That unprecedented total represents primary ticket sales for the US shows that Swift just concluded in Los Angeles, plus a second North American leg coming next year. That would make it the highest-grossing tour ever.
   
      It brought a boost to the economy in its many stops through North American cities – the final six nights of Taylor Swift’s Eras tour in Los Angeles were estimated to bring $320 million to the city, according to the California Center for Jobs and the Economy.
   
      She’s even putting the NFL on the map – at least for those who already weren’t tuning in to Sunday Night Football. News that the star was rumored to be attending an Oct. 1 game to see Kansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce has sent ticket prices soaring more than 40% — from $83 to $119 – according to TickPick, an online marketplace.
   
      The singer became a cultural phenomenon, adding to her economic influence. In cities where Swift performed, ridership on public transit spiked and hotel occupancy skyrocketed. Santa Clara, the tech-rich city located in Northern California, briefly became “Swiftie Clara.” In Seattle, dancing Swifties caused seismic activity that one seismologist said was equal to a 2.3 magnitude earthquake.
   
      The star is adding another album rerelease on Friday – “1989 (Taylor’s Version),” which earned a total of 10 Grammy nominations at the time it was released.
   
      Swift announced in 2019 that she planned to re-record her first six studio albums after her former label sold her master recordings. She has since released “Taylor’s Version” albums for “Red,” “Speak Now” and “Fearless.”
   
      Swift can now join the ranks of Rihanna, who became a billionaire in 2021, according to Forbes. Though it’s been years since Rihanna dropped an album, she spent that time building her business empire through her Fenty Beauty makeup line and her Savage x Fenty lingerie line. Jay Z and Beyoncé reached the milestone in 2017. Besides music, the pair had their hands in a variety of business ventures.

      Abandoned golf courses are being reclaimed by nature
    "," 
  Editor’s Note: Call to Earth is a CNN editorial series committed to reporting on the environmental challenges facing our planet, together with the solutions. Rolex’s Perpetual Planet initiative has partnered with CNN to drive awareness and education around key sustainability issues and to inspire positive action.
 
      Golf courses, despite occupying large green spaces, are not necessarily good for the environment. Land is often cleared to make way for a fairway and maintaining the pristine turf often requires a lot of water, regular mowing and the spraying of fertilizers and pesticides – none of which is good for biodiversity.
   
      In the US, with the number of course closures outweighing new openings every year since 2006, some are questioning how we should use these huge spaces – and asking whether, instead of golf, nature should be left to run its course.
   
      Conservation nonprofits and local authorities are looking to acquire golf courses that have been abandoned due to high maintenance costs, low player numbers or other reasons, and repurpose them into landscapes that boost biodiversity and build natural defenses against climate change.
   
      These spaces provide “huge opportunities from a conservation perspective,” says Guillermo Rodriguez, California state director of The Trust for Public Land (TPL), a conservation organization which is rewilding three of the state’s former courses.
   
      “It’s a multiple win,” he continues. “You increase public access by taking former private golf courses (and) turning them into public properties … (you return) water back into rivers and streams and create a better habitat for the endangered species that we have in California.”
   
      Take San Geronimo, an 18-hole course in northern California’s Marin County, located on two waterways, which are home to endangered coho salmon and steelhead trout. Since the course’s construction in 1965, much of the water from San Geronimo and Larsen Creek was being diverted to provide irrigation for the course, affecting fish populations in the area, says Rodriguez.
   
      In 2018, TPL purchased the 157-acre site and began converting the area back into its natural state: turning off the irrigation, removing culverts and dams built to capture water and starting to restore the habitat by planting native species. According to TPL, the rewilding process could take up to 10 years, but there are signs that wildlife is already bouncing back, with bobcats spotted roaming the area.
   
      Rodriguez admits that initially TPL’s plan received some strong opposition from the public, especially from the golfers. But after efforts to involve locals in the design and opening hiking and biking trails in the area attitudes are changing. Now known as San Geronimo Commons, the site is a thriving center for the local community, he says.
   
      Further down the coast in Santa Barbara is another of TPL’s acquisitions: Ocean Meadows. The nine-hole course was built in the 1960s on the site of a wetland. To create it, developers filled the plain with 500,000 cubic yards of soil.
   
      TPL purchased the 64-acre area in 2013 and started restoring the wetlands, removing the soil that had been added during construction and planting native vegetation. Since then, migratory birds have replaced birdies, and at least two pairs of threatened western snowy plovers are successfully breeding in the area’s mudflats.
   
      With the extreme shifts in weather patterns in recent years, especially in California, the benefits of having a wetland rather than a golf course have become clear, says Rodriguez. “Floodplains are able to kind of capture this water, protect infrastructure, protect other low-lying communities, and really let nature be an important solution,” he says.
   
      Most recently, TPL acquired Rancho Cañada, a 190-acre private golf course located in Monterey. It wants to widen and restore the riverbed and banks of the Carmel River, which runs through the course, helping to protect downstream neighborhoods from flooding.
   
      Crucially, the site will become part of a wider network of protected land, enabling a wildlife corridor from Ventana to Fort Ord. “The ability to remove fencing and create much more cohesion between the previous golf course and the surrounding public lands, really builds that connectivity back,” says Rodriguez.
   
      TPL is not the only organization on a mission to rewild golf courses. In Akron, Ohio, Summit Metro Parks acquired the 195-acre Valley View Golf Course in 2016, returning it to its natural state. In doing so it connected three local parks and created 1,900 contiguous acres of green space.
   
      The site has transformed, says Mike Johnson, chief of conservation at the nonprofit. Today, 90% of the vegetation is native, whereas the same percentage was non-native or invasive when it was a golf course, he says.
   
      “Golf courses are harsh environments, and to create them the vegetation used is usually non-native … It doesn’t have value for our local fish and wildlife,” he tells CNN.
   
      “We had to undo the golf course before we could restore the landscape,” he says, adding that they removed the levees, allowing the rivers and streams to run freely, and stripped out the turf and non-native trees before establishing a native cover of vegetation.
   
      “The response from wildlife has been huge,” he adds. “Prior to our work, we documented about 200 species of plant and wildlife that were living on the golf course at the time we acquired it. Today we have documented over 900 species of fish and wildlife that have returned to this area.”
   
      Across the pond, in the UK, a similar movement is underway. Frodsham golf course in Cheshire, where top Liverpool footballers like Michael Owen once teed off, was bought by the UK’s Woodland Trust last year, with the plan to plant 40,000 native trees on the site.
   
      “It’s still too soon to report any significant changes, but this summer more wildflowers were growing across the site because the fairways, greens, tees were not being mown as they would have been when it was being managed as a golf course,” says Neil Oxley, site manager for the Woodland Trust.
   
      The site will contribute to The Northern Forest scheme, an effort to plant 50 million trees across 10,000 square miles stretching coast to coast from Liverpool to Hull. Currently, the area only has 7.6% woodland cover, but the initiative hopes to increase this to 20%.
 
      In other areas of the country, local councils are repurposing unprofitable municipal golf courses to create more natural spaces. Erewash Borough Council is working with Derbyshire Wildlife Trust to turn the Pewit golf course into a nature reserve, after noting that few people were using it and it was a substantial drain on the council’s resources. Brighton and Hove City Council is rewilding the 220-acre Waterhall course to restore the area’s chalk grasslands.
   
      In the Melbourne suburb of Elwood, Elsternwick Park golf course has been transformed into a natural oasis, providing respite from the city both for wildlife and the local community.
   
      Bayside City Council, which decided to repurpose the course upon expiration of its lease, came up with a plan to create different habitats, from open water and swamp scrub to wetlands and woodland, that support a range of species. Although the project began in 2018 and is expected to take at least 10 years to complete, already the council has recorded more than 100 different indigenous plant species growing at the site.
   
      The plan also includes a network of paths so that visitors can explore and learn about the urban ecology. In 2022, the site was renamed Yalukit Willam Nature Reserve to recognize the Yalukit Willam clan of the Boon Wurrung people, who traditionally owned the land.

Since the course’s construction in 1965, much of the water from San Geronimo and Larsen Creek was being diverted to provide irrigation for the course, affecting fish populations in the area, says Rodriguez.
   
      In 2018, TPL purchased the 157-acre site and began converting the area back into its natural state: turning off the irrigation, removing culverts and dams built to capture water and starting to restore the habitat by planting native species. According to TPL, the rewilding process could take up to 10 years, but there are signs that wildlife is already bouncing back, with bobcats spotted roaming the area.
   
      Rodriguez admits that initially TPL’s plan received some strong opposition from the public, especially from the golfers. But after efforts to involve locals in the design and opening hiking and biking trails in the area attitudes are changing. Now known as San Geronimo Commons, the site is a thriving center for the local community, he says.
   
      Further down the coast in Santa Barbara is another of TPL’s acquisitions: Ocean Meadows. The nine-hole course was built in the 1960s on the site of a wetland. To create it, developers filled the plain with 500,000 cubic yards of soil.
   
      TPL purchased the 64-acre area in 2013 and started restoring the wetlands, removing the soil that had been added during construction and planting native vegetation. Since then, migratory birds have replaced birdies, and at least two pairs of threatened western snowy plovers are successfully breeding in the area’s mudflats.
   
      With the extreme shifts in weather patterns in recent years, especially in California, the benefits of having a wetland rather than a golf course have become clear, says Rodriguez. “Floodplains are able to kind of capture this water, protect infrastructure, protect other low-lying communities, and really let nature be an important solution,” he says.
   
      Most recently, TPL acquired Rancho Cañada, a 190-acre private golf course located in Monterey. It wants to widen and restore the riverbed and banks of the Carmel River, which runs through the course, helping to protect downstream neighborhoods from flooding.
   
      Crucially, the site will become part of a wider network of protected land, enabling a wildlife corridor from Ventana to Fort Ord. “The ability to remove fencing and create much more cohesion between the previous golf course and the surrounding public lands, really builds that connectivity back,” says Rodriguez.
   
      TPL is not the only organization on a mission to rewild golf courses. In Akron, Ohio, Summit Metro Parks acquired the 195-acre Valley View Golf Course in 2016, returning it to its natural state. In doing so it connected three local parks and created 1,900 contiguous acres of green space.
   
      The site has transformed, says Mike Johnson, chief of conservation at the nonprofit. Today, 90% of the vegetation is native, whereas the same percentage was non-native or invasive when it was a golf course, he says.
   
      “Golf courses are harsh environments, and to create them the vegetation used is usually non-native … It doesn’t have value for our local fish and wildlife,” he tells CNN.
   
      “We had to undo the golf course before we could restore the landscape,” he says, adding that they removed the levees, allowing the rivers and streams to run freely, and stripped out the turf and non-native trees before establishing a native cover of vegetation.
   
      “The response from wildlife has been huge,” he adds. “Prior to our work, we documented about 200 species of plant and wildlife that were living on the golf course at the time we acquired it. Today we have documented over 900 species of fish and wildlife that have returned to this area.”
   
      Across the pond, in the UK, a similar movement is underway. Frodsham golf course in Cheshire, where top Liverpool footballers like Michael Owen once teed off, was bought by the UK’s Woodland Trust last year, with the plan to plant 40,000 native trees on the site.
   
      “It’s still too soon to report any significant changes, but this summer more wildflowers were growing across the site because the fairways, greens, tees were not being mown as they would have been when it was being managed as a golf course,” says Neil Oxley, site manager for the Woodland Trust.
   
      The site will contribute to The Northern Forest scheme, an effort to plant 50 million trees across 10,000 square miles stretching coast to coast from Liverpool to Hull. Currently, the area only has 7.6% woodland cover, but the initiative hopes to increase this to 20%.
 
      In other areas of the country, local councils are repurposing unprofitable municipal golf courses to create more natural spaces. Erewash Borough Council is working with Derbyshire Wildlife Trust to turn the Pewit golf course into a nature reserve, after noting that few people were using it and it was a substantial drain on the council’s resources. Brighton and Hove City Council is rewilding the 220-acre Waterhall course to restore the area’s chalk grasslands.
   
      In the Melbourne suburb of Elwood, Elsternwick Park golf course has been transformed into a natural oasis, providing respite from the city both for wildlife and the local community.
   
      Bayside City Council, which decided to repurpose the course upon expiration of its lease, came up with a plan to create different habitats, from open water and swamp scrub to wetlands and woodland, that support a range of species. Although the project began in 2018 and is expected to take at least 10 years to complete, already the council has recorded more than 100 different indigenous plant species growing at the site.
   
      The plan also includes a network of paths so that visitors can explore and learn about the urban ecology. In 2022, the site was renamed Yalukit Willam Nature Reserve to recognize the Yalukit Willam clan of the Boon Wurrung people, who traditionally owned the land.

      The three-year cruise is running late – again

      It was billed as the first ‘affordable’ long-term cruise for people who wanted to live onboard while sailing the world.
   
      But a week before the original departure date, passengers who’ve signed up with Life at Sea cruises are still waiting to find out when they will hit the high seas.
   
      Miray Cruises, which owns Life at Sea, has still not secured the ship for the three-year round-the-world voyage, The AidaAura is currently docked at Bremerhaven in Germany as the sales process continues.
   
      And its most recent officially planned departure date – November 11, from Amsterdam, instead of the original November 1 from Istanbul – has been pushed back again. 
   
      After passengers said they were told over the weekend that the new planned date will be November 30, a spokesperson for the company told CNN that there is not yet any confirmed embarkation date or location.
   
      The company has since shared an update with residents – as passengers are to be known – who had been due to embark on the ship at Istanbul on the original date of November 1.
   
      Thanking them for their “unwavering support and understanding during these recent changes to our cruise itinerary,” they undertake to arrange a hotel stay and meals in Istanbul, as well as transportation from the airport after October 28. 
   
      They also request that anyone who has yet to start their journey remains in their current location “until the new embarkation point is finalized.” Those who stay at home will receive onboard credits when they eventually board the ship. 
   
      Those with refundable flights are advised to cancel them. The company says it will arrange new tickets for those with non-refundable fares, “once the new embarkation date and location have been officially determined.”
   
      However, the company is adamant that the cruise will still depart – albeit late.
   
      Passengers have previously expressed their concerns that the cruise might be indefinitely delayed, or even canceled.
   
      “We are all sitting on pins and needles right now – the uncertainty is excruciating,” said one, who wished to remain anonymous, last week.
   
      “I’m okay with a delay, but I won’t be okay with a cancellation.” 
   
      Another, who also declined to be named, told CNN that they feel “sad but proud that we signed up for such an amazing adventure.”
   
      “I just hope I get my money back if we don’t sail,” they added.

      Ethiopian scientist Gebisa Ejeta honored by President Biden with prestigious award
    "," 
      Earlier this week, Ethiopian Gebisa Ejeta joined an elite group of scientists when he was honored by US President Joe Biden in a ceremony at the White House. Ejeta, along with eight others, was awarded the National Medal of Science on Tuesday, the highest scientific honor in the nation.
   
      Born and raised in rural west-central Ethiopia, Ejeta has dedicated his life’s work to food science – specifically the study of sorghum, a gluten-free ancient grain. He was a 2009 recipient of the World Food Prize for his work with drought- and parasite-resistant hybrid strains. That same year, he was awarded Ethiopia’s National Hero Award.
   
      “Gebisa Ejeta is one of the most impactful geneticists in the world,” said Mung Chiang, president of Purdue University in the US, where Ejeta has been a researcher and faculty member since 1984.
   
      “Our university celebrates another prestigious and richly deserved honor, bestowed by the president of the United States, to Gebisa,” he continued in a press release.
   
      Roughly 500 million people in Africa and Asia rely on sorghum as a food source, and the grain is also widely used as livestock feed around the world, including in the US. Ejeta’s research focuses on some of the most “crucial traits” of the grain, according to Purdue, including “nutritional quality; drought and cold tolerance; and resistance to pests, diseases and Striga,” a harmful parasitic plant.
   
      “By developing sorghum strains that withstand droughts and parasites, he has improved food security for millions,” President Biden said as he awarded Ejeta his medal at the ceremony. “His advocacy for science, policy, and institutions as key to economic development has lifted the fortunes of farmers and strengthened the souls of nations.”
