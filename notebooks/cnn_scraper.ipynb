      "Pandas(Index=0, headline='\\n      Ukraine is ready to start process of joining European Union, Commission says\\n    ', content=' \\n      \\ufeffUkraine’s ambitions of joining the European Union received an important boost on Wednesday when the bloc’s executive body said detailed negotiations should begin next year.\\n   \\n      The European Commission said in a report that so-called accession talks should finally start,\\xa0nearly 18 months since the bloc accepted Ukraine as a candidate state. The same report\\xa0recommended that the process should also begin with\\xa0Moldova,\\xa0which borders Ukraine.\\n   \\n      On Wednesday, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said: “Today is a historic day, because today the Commission recommends that the Council opens accession negotiations with Ukraine and with Moldova.”\\n   \\n      Von der Leyen was speaking on the same day that the Commission published a report suggesting to EU member states that accession talks should finally start, nearly 18 months since the bloc accepted Ukraine as a candidate state. The same report suggests that accession talks with Moldova should also begin.\\n   \\n      Ukraine has held ambitions to join the EU\\xa0for more than a decade. In late 2013, then-President Viktor Yanukovych’s decision to scrap a trade deal with the European Union and instead turn toward Russia sparked street protests and his eventual ouster,\\xa0followed in March 2014 by Russia’s illegal annexation of Crimea. The aim of joining the bloc – along with NATO - has formally been part of Ukraine’s constitution since 2019.\\n   \\n      Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who applied for EU membership in February 2022, shortly before Russia invaded his country, welcomed Wednesday’s announcement.\\n   \\n      “Today, the history of Ukraine and the whole of Europe has taken the right step – the European Commission has recommended starting membership negotiations with Ukraine. Despite all the difficulties, we are moving forward,” he said.\\n   \\n      “Ukrainians have always been and remain part of our common European family. Our country must be in the European Union. Ukrainians deserve it both for their defense of European values and for the fact that even in times of full-scale war, we keep our word and develop state institutions,” he said, adding that “all the necessary decisions are being adopted.”\\n   \\n      While the decision to open negotiations with Ukraine is an important step on Zelensky’s path to EU membership, talks will not begin until a set of conditions have been met. With Ukraine currently at war, it is unclear and unlikely that those conditions will be met any time soon.\\n   \\n      And although Ukraine welcomed Brussels’ suggestion that talks open and fully expects\\xa0the 27 EU member states to agree and adopt the position later this year, the recommendation comes with some caveats that will be hard for Kyiv to swallow at this exact moment in time, particularly around the issue of fighting corruption.\\n   \\n      The European Commission said\\xa0in a statement: “The Ukrainian government and Parliament demonstrated resolve in making\\xa0substantial progress\\xa0on meeting the 7 steps” required for negotiations to open.\\n   \\n      A senior EU diplomat explained that while member states have taken “the political decision to open negotiations, the actual negotiations will only begin once the conditions are fully met” – which at this point could still be years.\\n   \\n      More importantly, Ukrainian officials have been concerned lately that attention has shifted from Ukraine to the Middle East since the\\xa0October 7\\xa0Hamas attacks on Israel and the Israeli government’s military response in Gaza.\\n   \\n      A senior adviser to Zelensky told CNN: “The terrorist attacks in Israel are just another war, just another crisis, diverting public attention in the US and to some extent in Europe. As far as the conflict goes, it’s in the interest of Russia for another front to be open. Any other international crisis means resources pulled away from us. Which is good for the new axis of Russia, Iran and North Korea.”\\n   \\n      Western resolve in support\\xa0of\\xa0Ukraine has remained remarkably solid ever since Russia launched its unprovoked\\xa0full-scale\\xa0attack\\xa0in February 2022. From financial and military support to open support for Ukraine joining Western institutions like the EU and NATO, many European officials have privately expressed their surprise at precisely how long Europe has not only remained focused, but\\xa0also\\xa0not torn itself apart.\\n   \\n      There are members of the Western alliance who are traditionally less hawkish when it comes to Russia than others. This mix of opinions becomes more complicated in any forum where the EU and NATO overlap.\\n   \\n      NATO’s history may be steeped in the aftermath of World War II and the subsequent Cold War divisions between east and west, but there are members who take a more sympathetic view of modern-day Russia: most notably Turkey and Hungary.\\n   \\n      The European Union, for its part, not only has a range of views and diplomatic relations regarding Russia, but has a number of countries who are officially militarily neutral. The balance has shifted with Finland joining NATO\\xa0this year\\xa0and Sweden likely to do so very soon, but Ireland and Austria retain their official position of neutrality even in 2023.\\n   \\n      Despite all of this, Ukraine has had what the European diplomat described as “our undivided attention” for the best part of two years.\\n   \\n      Some in Brussels are surprised – even a little angry – to learn that officials in Kyiv are concerned about\\xa0so-called\\ufeff\\xa0Ukraine fatigue. “I simply do not think that focus is shifting - to the contrary,” a commission official told CNN. “We have proposed 50 billion (euro)\\xa0support for Ukraine in the coming years.”\\n   \\n      Some European officials, also based in Brussels, are conversely surprised that some in the upper echelons of the European institutions are so dismissive of Ukraine’s concerns. “It’s true to a degree that focus has shifted. Just look at the media. It is focused only on Israel,” says a NATO diplomat.\\n   \\n      Some eastern European states in particular share the Ukrainian view that a shift in focus\\xa0toward the Middle East\\xa0plays into Russia’s hands.\\n   \\n      Lithuania’s foreign minister, who is planning to visit Washington to remind\\xa0the United States\\xa0of how important this moment is, said on X, formerly known as Twitter: “We are dangerously close to missing the opportunity to end centuries of the Kremlin’s imperial aggression and secure the future of multiple continents. Our children will curse us in the trenches we are digging for them.”\\n   \\n      The EU’s signal that it is politically ready for accession talks to formally begin is a significant milestone for Ukraine to have reached. It is, however, just one of many on its long path to EU membership.

After Russia pulled out Ukraine launched its own humanitarian corridor to try to circumvent what is in effect a Russian blockade.\\n   \\n      Ukraine’s infrastructure minister Oleksandr Kubrakov said the ship was supposed to carry iron ore to China, and described the extensive damage Russian strikes have inflicted on Ukrainian infrastructure since it allowed the grain deal to lapse.\\n   \\n      “This is the 21st attack on Black Sea ports in the Odesa region since Russia left the grain deal in July. During this time, the terrorist country damaged more than 160 infrastructure facilities and 122 transport vehicles,” Kubrakov wrote on Facebook.\\n   \\n      “That is why Ukraine is doing everything to strengthen air defense and protect the south of Ukraine from Russian terrorist attacks,” the minister said.\\n   \\n      Ukrainian authorities have launched an investigation into the Russian strike.\\n   \\n      Ukraine, often referred to as the “breadbasket of Europe,” is a major exporter of grain, much of which is sent to developing countries in Africa.

The answers to his questions about certain sacraments were published on the Vatican’s website in Italian on Wednesday evening.\\n   \\n      Regarding transgender people, the document says a person who identifies as transgender can be baptized like any other adult, “as long as there is no risk of causing scandal or disorientation” to other Catholics.\\n   \\n      Children who identify as transgender can also be baptized if “well prepared and willing,” it says. The document also states that transgender people, including those who have undergone gender reassignment procedures, can be godparents and witnesses in Catholic weddings under the right circumstances.\\n   \\n      Children of same-sex couples can also be baptized, as long as there is a “well-founded hope that he or she will be educated in the Catholic religion.”\\n   \\n      The document makes clear that people who live in homosexual relationships are still committing a sin, and that baptism must come with repentance for such sins. The document cites several sermons by Pope Francis for the ruling.\\n   \\n      “The church is not a tollhouse; it is the house of the father, where there is a place for everyone, with all their problems,” the document states, quoting the pope’s 2013 apostolic exhortation Evangelii Gaudium.\\n   \\n      In each circumstance, the priest is asked to use “pastoral prudence” in deciding whether to allow a transgender person’s participation.\\n   \\n      “It is necessary to consider the real value that the ecclesial community confers on the duties of the godfather and godmother, the role they play in the community, and the consideration they show toward the teaching of the Church.”\\n   \\n      The document added that the priest should also take into consideration if there are other people in the extended family who can “guarantee” the “proper transmission of the Catholic faith” to the baptized person.\\n   \\n      LGBTQ issues were a major area of discussion during the Vatican’s recent synod.\\n   \\n      Francis DeBernardo, executive director of the New Ways Ministry, a Catholic LGBT advocacy group based in the United States, said in a statement that the “Vatican’s affirmation that transgender people should be welcomed in the church’s sacramental life signals Pope Francis’ desire for a pastorally-focused approach to LGBTQ+ issues is taking hold.”\\n   \\n      However, the group warns that the ruling doesn’t go far enough.\\n   \\n      “If church leaders do not employ pastoral prudence with this guideline, it could be used by\\xa0other officials to establish other policies which would exclude such people from other areas of church life,” DeBernardo writes.\\n   \\n      “Focusing particularly on the ineligibility of people in ‘stable, marriage-like relations’ who are ‘well known by the community’ suggests that the DDF remains more concerned about ‘causing scandal’ than about integrating LGBTQ+ Catholics in the lives of the church and of their families,” he continues.\\n   \\n      “We hope that church leaders will apply these guidelines by following Pope Francis’ example of extravagant welcome, rather than using them to continue old restrictions.”\\n   \\n      The group calls the affirmation a “reversal of a previous Vatican decision” and notes that ”not only does this doctrinal note, known as a responsum ad dubia, remove barriers to transgender people’s participation, it proves that the Catholic Church can—and does—change its mind about certain practices and policies.”\\n  ', 'authors': [], 'upload_timestamp': Timestamp('2023-11-09 06:52:00'), 'read_time': 3, 'url': 'https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/09/europe/vatican-transgender-baptism-intl-scli/index.html', 'image': <__main__.Image object at 0x7fa8e701d890>, 'scraping_timestamp': Timestamp('2023-11-09 15:14:20.170112')}\n",

The decline exceeded the 0.1% fall forecast by a Reuters poll of analysts.\\n   \\n      The drop was mainly attributed to falling food prices, particularly pork, which has been sliding for months and is down 30% compared to a year ago, according to Goldman Sachs analysts.\\n   \\n      Pork prices have been under pressure as increased supply of the meat has outstripped demand. As China’s most consumed meat, pork has an outsized weighting in the consumer price index.\\n   \\n      Core inflation, which strips away the traditionally volatile categories of fresh food and energy, fell even more sharply in October, by 0.6%.\\n   \\n      Economists say that’s bad news, because it reflects low consumer demand in general. The new data adds to “evidence of renewed economic weakness,” Capital Economics wrote in a note to clients Thursday.\\n   \\n      Robert Carnell, regional head of research for Asia Pacific at ING, disputed the notion that China’s economy was suffering from deflation, which economists define as a sustained and broad decline in general price levels for goods and services over a period of time.\\n   \\n      He said deflation was a “pernicious” situation characterized by a decline in consumer prices as well as the prices of assets and wages, leading to a sharp slowdown in economic activity.\\n   \\n      “What China has right now, is a low rate of underlying inflation, which reflects the fact that domestic demand is fairly weak,” he wrote in a Thursday report.\\n   \\n      China briefly slipped into deflation in July, with CPI falling by 0.3%. But consumer prices recovered in August.\\n   \\n      The country is grappling with an uneven economic recovery as it battles a series of challenges, including an ailing property market and heightened reluctance among some businesses and consumers to invest or spend.\\n   \\n      Poor sentiment is on display at the world’s biggest annual shopping festival, Singles Day. This year, the weeks-long retail blowout, which officially starts on November 11, has forced e-commerce players to offer eye-popping discounts in a bid to entice shoppers to open up their wallets.\\n   \\n      Chinese suppliers of goods are facing challenges, too. The producer price index, which measures the prices of goods at the factory gate,\\xa0fell 2.6% last month compared to a year ago, NBS data showed.\\n   \\n      This drop “reflects uncertainty around the solidity of\\xa0China’s recovery,” HSBC Greater China economist Erin Xin noted in a report.\\n   \\n      This “will likely keep policymakers on guard to keep support coming through,” she added.\\n  ', 'authors': ['Michelle Toh'], 'upload_timestamp': Timestamp('2023-11-09 06:07:00'), 'read_time': 2, 'url': 'https://edition.cnn.com/2023/11/09/economy/china-deflation-october-consumer-prices-intl-hnk/index.html', 'image': <__main__.Image object at 0x7fa8e64e6050>, 'scraping_timestamp': Timestamp('2023-11-09 15:14:22.809798')}\n",
