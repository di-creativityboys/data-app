      "BBC News\n",
      "New Foreign Secretary David Cameron has made his first working visit to Ukraine, meeting President Volodymyr Zelensky in Kyiv.\n",
      "Lord Cameron reiterated the UK's support for Ukraine, promising moral, diplomatic and \"above all military support for... however long it takes\".\n",
      "Mr Zelensky congratulated Mr Cameron on his new post and thanked him for the UK's continued backing.\n",
      "Lord Cameron became foreign secretary in a cabinet shuffle on Monday.\n",
      "\"This is very important, especially now, when the world is paying attention not only to the situation on the battlefield in Ukraine, and dividing the focus really does not help,\" the Ukrainian president said, alluding to the Middle East.\n",
      "\"We are grateful for the unwavering support of Ukraine from the United Kingdom. We are grateful for the warm welcome of Ukrainian citizens in the UK. And we are glad that you came to Ukraine,\" he said.\n",
      "Mr Zelensky posted a short clip of the meeting to social media, during which Lord Cameron can be heard saying \"I wanted this to be my first visit.\"\n",
      "\"What I want to say by being here is that we will continue to give you the moral support, the diplomatic support and the economic support and above all the military support that you need not just this year and next year but however long as it takes,\" Lord Cameron said.\n",
      "The former UK prime minister added: \"I've had some disagreements with Boris Johnson, we've known each other for 40 years, but his support for you was the finest thing he and his government did.\"\n",
      "Ukraine's foreign ministry said the pair discussed weapons, arms production, and security in the Black Sea.\n",
      "In a statement following the meeting, Lord Cameron said: \"As winter approaches, we continue to stand with the Ukrainian people as they resist Putin's illegal invasion. In the last three months, they have pushed Russia back in the Black Sea and are opening vital sea trade routes for the Ukrainian economy and global food supplies.\"\n",
      "Lord Cameron left Ukraine on Thursday afternoon.\n",
      "The UK has provided Ukraine with billions of pounds in military aid since Russia launched its invasion in February 2022.\n",
      "Military hardware donations have included a number of Challenger 2 tanks and long-range missiles, and tens of thousands of Ukrainian recruits have been trained by the British military on UK soil.\n",
      "Lord Cameron's visit comes after Ukrainian forces succeeded in establishing positions across the Dnipro river in southern Ukraine, a potentially significant advance. Local Russian-installed officials acknowledged on Wednesday that Ukrainian forces were present in the village of Krynky, on the Russian-occupied left (east) bank.\n",
      "The river has separated Ukrainian and Russian forces since Moscow's troops withdrew from Kherson a year ago.\n",
      "The news has heartened Ukrainians, whose four-month-old counter-offensive has failed to regain significant occupied territory from Russia.\n",
      "Cameron's return\n",
      "Lord Cameron's new post marks his return to the cabinet table for the first time in more than seven years.\n",
      "He has replaced James Cleverly, who was moved to be home secretary to take over from Suella Braverman in a dramatical overhaul of Rishi Sunak's cabinet on Monday.\n",
      "Lord Cameron was prime minister from 2010 to 2016, resigning after the UK voted to leave the EU as he had backed the Remain campaign.\n",
      "In the time since, Lord Cameron has occupied himself with various business endeavours, charity work, teaching and speaking engagements.\n",
      "There has been some controversy about Lord Cameron's return to the cabinet, since he is no longer an elected MP and will sit as a peer rather than in the Commons.\n",
      "Opposition parties and Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle have raised concerns about how MPs will be able to hold Lord Cameron to account, given he will not be in the Commons chamber to take questions during the regular departmental scrutiny sessions.\n",
      "Instead, those questions will be fielded by the ministers below him at the Foreign Office, including Andrew Mitchell and Anne-Marie Trevelyan. It is not uncommon for deputies to answer for the department, although this normally occurs if the foreign secretary is on diplomatic visits around the world.\n",

Two senior Democrats, Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer and House minority leader Hakeem Jeffries, joined him, along with Republican Senator Joni Ernst.\\nThey raised their hands together and led the audience in a chant of \"we stand with Israel\".\\n\"There are few issues in Washington that could so easily bring together leaders of both parties in both chambers,\" Mr Johnson said, \"but the survival of the state of Israel unites us together and unites all Americans.\"\\nThe Democrats are divided, however. While the two congressional leaders, along with President Joe Biden, have been firm in their support for Israel following the attack, a growing number on the left are calling attention to Palestinian civilian casualties and condemning the Israeli military campaign.\\nWith the exception of a handful of Republican politicians, however, dissent on the right has been missing.\\nWhen a standalone bill providing $14.3bn (£11.5bn) in US aid to Israel was introduced in the House of Representatives, only two Republicans - Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Thomas Massie of Kentucky - voted no.\\nTheir isolated opposition is a far cry from the significant and growing number of Republicans who oppose continued US support for Ukraine, the world\\'s other current major international conflict.\\nThe influence of an evangelical leader invited to speak towards the end of the March for Israel\\'s programme helps explain why Israel is treated differently by Republicans.\\nElectoral politics begin to bite into Ukraine support\\nBiden vows to stand by Ukraine, despite budget fiasco\\nCPAC 2022: US conservatives show little interest in Ukraine\\nJohn Hagee is a Texas-based Christian minister and president of Christians United for Israel, which boasts 10 million members.\\nIn 2008, he said the Holocaust was part of God\\'s plan to return Jews to Israel. The Republican presidential candidate at the time, John McCain, declined his endorsement in part because of those comments.\\nThe organisers of Tuesday\\'s march, the Jewish Federations of North America and the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations, invited Mr Hagee to speak at their rally, however, as a part of a \"voices of allies\" segment. The organisers did not immediately respond to BBC requests for comment.\\nFor his part, Mr Hagee was effusive in his support for Israel. He told the crowd that a line should be drawn uniting Christians and Jews and that there was no \"middle\" ground in the conflict between Israel and Hamas.\\n\"We must all stand united with one voice and boldly declare over and over: Israel, you are not alone,\" he said.\\nIn his deep southern preacher drawl, he placed the fate of Israel squarely in a religious context.\\n\"The God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob guarantees Israel\\'s deliverance will come as proclaimed every year during Passover,\" he said. \"Israel is the apple of God\\'s eye. Israel is the shining city on the hill. God says of Israel, Israel is my firstborn son.\"\\nFor some evangelicals, however, the ties between their religion and the fate of Israel have a darker hue. And it\\'s where Mr Hagee\\'s more controversial views come into play.\\nIn the End Days, a certain strain of Christian theology holds, the Jewish people will either convert to Christianity or perish in flames. It is a key step towards Armageddon that is then followed by 1,000 years of peace, according to this belief.\\nA Pew Research survey last year found 39% of Americans - including 63% of evangelicals - believe humanity is \"living in the end times\".\\nAnd for the moment - on the stage in Washington on Tuesday and in the halls of Congress - the interests of Israel, Republicans and evangelicals are in alignment.\\nRelated Topics\\nIsrael-Gaza war\\nIsrael\\nGaza\\nIsrael–US relations\\nUnited States\\nMore on this story\\nShockwaves from Israel-Hamas war disrupt US politics\\nPublished\\n9 October\\nHouse passes Israel bill despite Biden veto threat\\nPublished\\n3 November\\nTreacherous ground for US politicians on Israel-Gaza\\nPublished\\n13 October'}\n"
