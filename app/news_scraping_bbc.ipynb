      "Today, I interviewed Ghazi Hamad, a long-time Hamas member and spokesman, who was in Beirut.\n",
      "Sitting down with a representative of a group that many governments deem a terrorist organisation was not a decision taken lightly. But it was a chance to ask, face to face, about the attacks Hamas carried out in Israel on 7 October in which it killed more than 1,400 people, mostly civilians, and took more than 200 people hostage.\n",
      "Hamad refused to acknowledge that his group had deliberately targeted civilians, despite the overwhelming evidence, including footage from body cameras worn by the fighters. He said the attack had been a “military operation” intended to target only military personnel.\n",
      "I repeatedly asked him how that could possibly have been an attack on military targets only when hundreds of civilians had been killed, including people at a music festival and in their own homes, with their families. He then abruptly interrupted the interview and walked away.\n",
      "Before that, Hamad suggested Hamas was open to negotiations over the civilian hostages it is holding in Gaza. But, he said, there needed to be certain circumstances for that to happen, without specifying which.\n",
