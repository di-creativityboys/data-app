       "  'contents': ' \\n      The entire population of Gaza is “being dehumanized,” the chief of the main UN agency operating there told the UN Security Council Monday, as pressure intensified on the besieged strip with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ruling out a ceasefire, saying “this\\xa0is a time for war.”\\n   \\n      Philippe Lazzarini, commissioner general of the UN Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) told the Security Council that thousands of children killed in Israeli airstrikes in Gaza in the past three weeks “cannot be collateral damage.”\\n   \\n      Major UN agencies are calling for a humanitarian ceasefire to allow deliveries of aid  for more than 2 million civilians trapped with scarce supplies of food, water and medical equipment, and for the safe release of 240 hostages that Israel believes are being held by Hamas, the militant group that controls the enclave.\\n   \\n      “An immediate humanitarian ceasefire has become a matter of life and death for millions,” Lazzarini said. The director of the UN\\xa0Office\\xa0for the Coordination of\\xa0Humanitarian\\xa0Affairs (OCHA), Lisa Doughten, told the Security Council that the “scale of the horror” being experienced by Gazans is “hard to convey.”\\n   \\n      “We simply do not have enough essential supplies to provide for the survival of internally displaced people at this scale,”\\xa0Doughten\\xa0said.\\n   \\n      However, Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu made clear on Monday that Israel would not agree to a ceasefire, as it responds with unrelenting force to Hamas’ October 7 terror attacks, which killed 1,400 people, mostly civilians, and saw hundreds taken hostage.\\n   \\n      Drawing parallels to the United States’ position after Pearl Harbor in 1941 and the September 11\\xa0attacks in 2001, Netanyahu said that while the Bible says there is a time for peace, “this\\xa0is a time for war.”\\n   \\n      “Calls for a ceasefire or calls for Israel to surrender to Hamas, to surrender to terrorists, surrender to barbarism, that will not happen,” he said.\\n   \\nHere’s the latest:\\n \\n      Gazans contended with another night of intense strikes into Tuesday, with the IDF firing artillery rounds and mortars and launching airstrikes. CNN teams saw numerous large explosions in northern Gaza.\\n   \\n      The IDF said it attacked hundreds of Hamas targets overnight. IDF spokesperson Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari\\xa0said Tuesday that “in combined and coordinated attacks by the ground and air forces, terrorists were eliminated.”\\n   \\n      On Monday, Israel vowed that its ground offensive in Gaza will\\xa0“intensify,” as CNN analysis suggested troops had advanced more than 2 miles (about 3 kilometers) into the enclave.\\n   \\n      Videos released by the IDF on Tuesday morning show Israeli soldiers on the ground in Gaza, progressing on foot and in tanks through rural areas as well as in what appears to be a significantly war-damaged urban district.\\n   \\n      IDF forces struck “approximately 300 targets” over the past day, including military compounds inside underground tunnels it said belonged to Hamas.\\n   \\n      Despite the intensified IDF ground operation, Hamas continued to fire rockets from Gaza. Alarms indicating incoming fire were activated in a number of areas around the Gaza perimeter overnight and early Tuesday.\\n   \\n      The Israeli military said Monday its troops killed\\xa0four prominent Hamas operatives\\xa0as part of its\\xa0expanded ground operations\\xa0in Gaza.\\n   \\n      Meanwhile, a Hamas spokesperson said Israel was not successful in entering Gaza “except in some limited areas” and described the humanitarian situation in the enclave as “disastrous.”\\n   \\n      At least 13 people, including children, were killed overnight when an Israeli airstrike hit a home in al-Zawaida in central Gaza’s Deir al Balah, Khalil Al Dikran, head of nursing at the Al Aqsa Martyrs Hospital, told a journalist working for CNN on Tuesday.\\n   \\n      The reporter, who was at the hospital on Tuesday morning, counted 44 bodies in the morgue tent being prepared for burial.\\n   \\n      The other casualties were killed in airstrikes Monday afternoon on two homes and a wedding hall sheltering residents displaced from northern Gaza, according to Al Dikran.\\n   \\n      Israel’s bombardment of Gaza has killed at least\\xa08,260 people, mostly civilians, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Ramallah, which draws the information from the Hamas-controlled enclave. More than 70% those killed are from vulnerable populations, including children, women and elderly individuals, the ministry said Monday.\\n   \\n      Among the dead are 64 UN aid workers, the highest number of UN aid workers killed in a conflict anywhere in the world in such a short period of time, according to UNRWA’s Lazzarini.\\n   \\n      The most recent death was a man called Samir who was killed alongside his wife and eight children, Lazzarini told the UN Security Council.\\n   \\n      “Those who are alive, have, for the most part, lost relatives, friends, neighbors and are displaced like the majority of Gazans,” he said, adding that despite the threat to their lives, they continue to “work tirelessly.”\\n   \\n      The conflict has also been the “deadliest period” for journalists covering Israel and Gaza since records began in 1992, according to the Committee to Protect\\xa0Journalists\\xa0(CPJ).\\n   \\n      At least 31\\xa0journalists\\xa0have been killed since October 7, including 26 Palestinians, four Israelis, and one Lebanese, the CPJ said, adding that it is investigating “numerous unconfirmed reports” of missing\\xa0journalists\\xa0and others who may been killed, detained, injured, or threatened.\\n   \\n      Speaking before the UN Security Council Monday, the\\xa0Palestinian\\xa0Authority’s Foreign Minister Riyad Al-Maliki said, “2.3 million\\xa0Palestinians in Gaza face death every day and every night” and pleaded with the council to “save them.”\\n   \\n      “Look at them as human beings. You cannot look only at one side and ignore this tragic humanity completely,” Al-Maliki said.\\n   \\n      Numerous hospitals in Gaza have borne the brunt of airstrikes and shelling, according to aid groups and health workers.\\n   \\n      In a social media post early Tuesday morning, the Palestine Red Crescent Society said the Tal Al Hawa neighborhood of Gaza City, in which\\xa0the\\xa0Al-Quds\\xa0hospital\\xa0is located, was under heavy “artillery and airstrikes.”\\n   \\n      “The building is trembling,” and those sheltering inside the\\xa0hospital\\xa0are “experiencing fear and panic,” the PRCS said.\\n   \\n      The organization said over the weekend that Israeli airstrikes have “caused extensive damage to hospital departments and exposed residents and patients to suffocation” at Al-Quds and accused Israel of “deliberately” launching airstrikes “directly next to” the facility in order to force an evacuation of the hospital, the second-largest in Gaza City.\\n   \\n      The facility is treating hundreds of patients, while some 12,000 internally displaced civilians are also sheltering there, the agency said.\\n   \\n      Gaza’s leading\\xa0cancer\\xa0hospital was also damaged in an Israeli attack, hospital director Sobhi Skaik told CNN on Monday, with its third floor suffering a direct hit causing damage to oxygen and water supplies. He said that no one was injured in the attack.\\n   \\n      CNN has asked the Israeli military for comment. Israel has repeatedly accused Hamas of operating from bunkers and tunnels underneath hospitals and of stockpiling weaponry near medical facilities.\\n   \\n      Hamas on Monday released a short video showing three women who are\\xa0believed to be captives\\xa0held by the Palestinian militant group since its\\xa0October 7\\xa0attack.\\n   \\n      The women are seated in plastic chairs facing the camera, while one addresses Netanyahu directly with increasing fury, demanding Israeli leaders to “free us all.”\\n   \\n      Relatives of the\\xa0hostages\\xa0have named the women as\\xa0Yelena Trupanob, Daniel Aloni and Rimon Kirsht. CNN is unable to verify anything about their circumstances or well-being, and because the women are\\xa0hostages, the statement could have been made under duress.\\n   \\n      IDF spokesperson Hagari said Hamas was engaging in “mind games” by releasing the footage of the women.\\n   \\n      Talks involving the US, Israel, Qatar, Egypt and Hamas are underway to get a group of hostages\\xa0out of Gaza, a task that sources say has been further complicated\\xa0by\\xa0Israel’s expansion of its ground operations.\\n   \\n      One hostage – a female Israeli soldier – was rescued Monday during ground operations in Gaza, the IDF said.\\n   \\n      IDF spokesperson Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus told CNN Tuesday the soldier, named as Private Ori Megidish, was “actively rescued” in a special operation “targeted in specifically getting her out.”\\n   \\n      “Based on intelligence” the Israeli special forces went into northern Gaza knowing her whereabouts and rescued her, Conricus said, adding that she is “well mentally and physically,” and reunited with her family.\\n   \\n      Meanwhile, Shani Louk, a 23-year-old German-Israeli woman who was abducted from the Nova music festival and taken to Gaza has been declared dead, Israel’s Foreign Ministry said Monday.\\n   \\n      A source involved with her identification told CNN Louk’s death was announced after forensic examiners found a bone fragment from her skull.\\n   \\nThis story is developing and is being updated.\\n  ',\n",

       "  'contents': ' \\n      The cast of “Friends” is taking time to “grieve and process” the death of their former co-star Matthew Perry.\\n   \\n      In a joint statement provided to CNN on Monday, Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, David Schwimmer and Matt LeBlanc wrote: “We are all so utterly devastated by the loss of Matthew. We were more than just cast mates. We are a family.”\\n   \\n      “There is so much to say, but right now we’re going to take a moment to grieve and process this unfathomable loss,” the statement, released by their individual representatives, continued. “In time we will say more, as and when we are able. For now, our thoughts and our love are with Matty’s family, his friends, and everyone who loved him around the world.”\\n   \\n      Perry died Saturday at his home in the Los Angeles area. He was 54.\\n   \\n      Perry, 54, starred on the NBC sitcom “Friends” from 1994 to 2004 as\\xa0Chandler Bing, the charming and sarcastic member of a group of tight-knit friends living in New York City. The show was one of the most popular of its era and has continued to reach young audiences on streaming platforms.\\n   \\n      In his role, Perry was nominated for an Emmy in 2002 for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series, and he was also nominated in 2021 for executive producing the “Friends: The Reunion” special on what was then known as HBO Max.\\n   \\n      Perry was found “unconscious in a stand-alone jacuzzi,” according to a statement from the Los Angeles Fire Department provided to CNN on Monday.\\n   \\n      “A bystander had brought the man’s head above the water and gotten him to the edge, then Firefighters removed him from the water upon their arrival,” they said when asked about the incident at Perry’s address. “A rapid medical assessment, sadly, revealed the man was deceased prior to first responder arrival.”\\n   \\n      The LACFD said the circumstances are being investigated by the Los Angeles Police Department and the Los Angeles County Medical Examiner, but there is currently no foul play suspected, a law enforcement source told CNN.\\n   \\n      An autopsy has been conducted, but examiners are awaiting the results of toxicology reports in order to determine Perry’s cause of death, the medical examiner’s office told CNN on Sunday. Such reports can take weeks to complete.\\n   \\n      On Sunday,\\xa0“Friends” co-creators Marta Kauffman and David Crane and executive producer Kevin Bright released a statement to CNN, saying they were “shocked and deeply, deeply saddened by our beloved friend Matthew’s passing.”\\n   \\n      “We will always cherish the joy, the light, the blinding intelligence he brought to every moment - not just to his work, but in life as well. He was always the funniest person in the room,” the statement said. “More than that, he was the sweetest, with a giving and selfless heart…This truly is The One Where Our Hearts Are Broken.”\\n   \\n      The chemistry between the cast of “Friends” stretched far beyond their on-screen dynamic. The actors have remained close since the show ended in 2004.\\n   \\n      In an emotional moment on HBO Max’s “Friends: The Reunion” special in 2021, Perry said that anytime they’d run into each other “that was the end of the night. You just stay with the person all night long and that was it.”\\n   \\n      Perry’s castmates have also at times helped him work through his struggles with addiction. In his memoir, he\\xa0recounted\\xa0how a visit to his trailer from Aniston made him realize that his battle with alcoholism wasn’t as secret as he thought.\\n   \\n      “‘I know you’re drinking,’ she said,” Perry wrote, later adding that being “confronted” by Aniston about his drinking was “devastating.”\\n   \\n      Their close connection as a group carried over into their business dealings as well.\\n   \\n      In 1996, the cast employed a then-landmark negotiation tactic to strike new deals with their studio:\\xa0sticking together. By the end of the show’s run, each primary cast member was making\\xa0$1 million per episode.\\n   \\n      “It’s a very loving, tight knit group,” Perry said during a 2021\\xa0interview\\xa0with Entertainment Tonight.\\n   \\n      “When we see each other, it’s a very heartwarming thing,” he added.\\n   \\nCNN’s Taylor Romine,\\xa0Josh Campbell,\\xa0Cheri Mossburg, Dan Heching and Lisa Respers France contributed to this report.\\n',\n",

       "  'contents': ' \\n      A restroom with an out-of-this-world view could be the surprise highlight for travelers adventuring with space tourism start-up Space Perspective.\\n   \\n      The Florida-based company plans to take travelers some 100,000 feet to the edge of space via a pressurized capsule suspended from a high-tech balloon.\\n   \\n      As trips are set to last around six hours, naturally the capsule needed an onboard bathroom. When envisaging what that might look like, Space Perspective founder and co-CEO Jane Poynter and her team settled on what the British-born Poynter dubs a “loo with a view.”\\n   \\n      “Why not have a loo with a view?” Poynter tells CNN Travel.\\n \\n      Concepts from designers Dan Window and Isabella Trani depict a gleaming restroom with a large window looking out over the stars and the curvature of the earth.\\n   \\n      Poynter says the bathroom is designed to be a place travelers can take stock of their space excursion.\\n   \\n      “It’s going to be almost overwhelming at certain points,” Poynter says of the experience. “So we wanted to create a space where people could go to take time for themselves for a moment.”\\n   \\n      While the view is the main attraction, there’s also a window blind – less for privacy’s sake (there’s not exactly anyone else around) and more in case travelers want to take a moment to process.\\n   \\n      “That’s why the toilet seat itself has a cushion, so you can sit there,” adds Poynter.\\n   \\n      The bathroom design puts “wellness” at the center, according to Poynter – hence its official name “Space Spa.”\\n   \\n      When asked by CNN Travel whether that name suggests there could one day be a hot tub alongside the toilet and sink, Poynter laughs, then concedes “the capsule interior can be modified” suggesting potentially anything from a dining room table to a research could be included in the capsule.\\n   \\n      Since Dennis Tito, the first ever “space tourist” hit the skies in 2001, few travelers have followed in his footsteps. But in recent years, high-profile space tourism companies such as SpaceX, Blue Origin and Virgin Galactic have been making moves in this arena, vowing to make space the next must-visit vacation spot.\\n   \\n      Also planning excursions via a stratospheric balloon is French company Zephalto, which aims to serve up Michelin-star-level meals on the “edge of space.”\\n \\n      It’s worth remembering there’s a big difference between a trip to orbital space – involving gravity-busting high-speed takeoffs and longer duration – and suborbital space, in which travelers are briefly exposed to weightlessness and views of space during a flight to the edge of the atmosphere, 60 miles above Earth.\\n   \\n      And trips to the “edge of space” – like those proposed by Space Perspective and Zephalto – are different again.\\n   \\n      These capsules won’t actually hit suborbital space, but will still fly significantly higher than your average commercial airplane. That means great views of the Earth and the stars, but without the loss of gravity and accompanying feeling of weightlessness – hence why a swanky bathroom is possible.\\n   \\n      Space Perspective hopes to start transporting groups of up to eight passengers on flights by the end of 2024.\\n   \\n      But there are still several stages before the balloon and capsule can get off the ground so Poynter says while the company is aiming for that date, she “would suggest you don’t put that on the calendar.”\\n   \\n      The company is regulated by the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the US Coast Guard and Poynter says ensuring safety is very important to the team. Space Perspective intends to start tests fights imminently.\\n   \\n      While the exact lift off date is still TBC, Space Perspective’s $125,000 tickets are already being snapped up.\\n   \\n      “People want to be first in line,” says Poynter.\\n  ',\n",

This year it declared 2023 through 2025 the “Years to Visit Mongolia,” easing entry conditions for international travelers and improving infrastructure, not least with a new $650 million airport.\\n   \\n      Other countries to make the 10 top picks include popular favorites such as Mexico, Croatia and St. Lucia, as well as lesser visited spots such as Benin and Uzbekistan.\\n   \\n      The top city on Lonely Planet list is Nairobi, the Kenyan capital, which the travel giant loves for its “unique rhythms, impressive array of locally inspired restaurants, and steady rotation of arts and culture venues.” We love it also for Nairobi National Park, just a short drive out of the city’s central business district, where you can see more than 400 species roaming the open grass plains while skyscrapers twinkle on the skyline.\\n   \\n      Paris, host of the 2024 Summer Olympics and Paralympics, is also on the list, as is Prague, another European capital which is no stranger to tourist crowds. Lonely Planet says the Covid-19 lockdown has allowed the Czech capital to “hit the reset button”\\xa0 and to promote “slow tourism and attractions away from the city center.”\\n   \\n      The top sustainable travel destination for 2024 is Spain, because of the country’s efforts to expand renewable energy, to boost off-season travel and to bring tourism to emerging destinations, such as the port city of Valencia, thereby easing pressures on hot spots such as Barcelona.\\n   \\n      The “wild beauty” of South Africa also gets a nod, with Lonely Planet recommending visitors check out the country’s “impressive crop of ecolodges” committed to protecting Earth’s biodiversity. We also love Babanango, South Africa’s big new game park which is transforming the KwaZulu Natal region into a wildlife wonderland.\\n   \\n      The best-value category will be of particular interest to many in these wallet-pinching times. The underrated American Midwest is the top tip here: in cities such as Chicago, Milwaukee and Detroit, “you’ll find old warehouses transformed into art studios, new eco design hotels and many Michelin-starred restaurants,” says Lonely Planet.\\n   \\n      The publisher also recommends Algeria as an under-explored corner of Northern Africa. Pointing out that it’s a three-hour flight or less from much of Europe, Lonely Planet says visitors will find “well-preserved Roman sites and fine historic cities” and “an affordable, crowd-free experience.”\\n   \\n      When it comes to regional picks, the Western Balkans’ upcoming Trans Dinarica cycling route is a top choice by Lonely Planet. Opening next year, the 3,364-kilometer (2,090-mile) trail passes through Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Hercegovina, Montenegro, Albania, North Macedonia, Kosovo and Serbia, taking in mountain ranges and the Adriatic Sea along the way.\\n   \\n      Donegal, Ireland’s most northwestern county, has the country’s longest coastline and more than 100 beaches – and the chances are good that a visitor might get one all to themselves. Says Lonely Planet, “Here you’ll find the highest sea cliffs in Europe and miles of unspoilt coastal hiking trails.”\\n   \\nCountries\\n \\n      Mongolia\\n   \\n      India\\n   \\n      Morocco\\n   \\n      Chile\\n   \\n      Benin\\n   \\n      Mexico\\n   \\n      Uzbekistan\\n   \\n      Pakistan\\n   \\n      Croatia\\n   \\n      St. Lucia\\n   \\nRegions\\n \\n      Western Balkans’ Trans Dinarica Cycling Route\\n   \\n      Kangaroo Island, South Australia\\n   \\n      Donegal, Ireland\\n   \\n      País Vasco, Spain\\n   \\n      Southern Thailand\\n   \\n      Swahili Coast, Tanzania\\n   \\n      Montana, USA\\n   \\n      Saalfelden Leogang, Austria\\n   \\nCities\\n \\n      Nairobia, Kenya\\n   \\n      Paris, France\\n   \\n      Montreal, Canada\\n   \\n      Mostar, Bosnia and Herzegovina\\n   \\n      Philadelphia, Pennsylvania\\n   \\n      Manaus, Brazil\\n   \\n      Jakarta, Indonesia\\n   \\n      Prague, Czech Republic\\n   \\n      Izmir, Turkey\\n   \\n      Kansas City, Missouri\\n   \\nSustainable\\n \\n      Spain\\n   \\n      Patagonia, Argentina and Chile\\n   \\n      Greenland\\n   \\n      Wales’ trails\\n   \\n      The Portuguese Way / Caminho Português de Santiago\\n   \\n      Palau\\n   \\n      Hokkaido, Japan\\n   \\n      Ecuador\\n   \\n      Baltic Trails of Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania\\n   \\n      Eco-lodges of South Africa\\n   \\nValue\\n \\n      The Midwest, USA\\n   \\n      Poland\\n   \\n      Nicaragua\\n   \\n      Danube Limes, Bulgaria\\n   \\n      Normandy, France\\n   \\n      Egypt\\n   \\n      Ikaria, Greece\\n   \\n      Algeria\\n   \\n      Southern Lakes & Central Otago, New\\xa0 Zealand\\n   \\n      Night trains, Europe\\n  ',\n",

       " {'headline': '\\n      From his parents objecting to him playing basketball to officiating in the NBA: the South Korean referee making history\\n    ',\n",
       "  'contents': ' \\n      You’ve got the best spot in the arena, up close and personal with the world’s best players performing remarkable feats of athleticism and skill. The downside is every decision you make is relentlessly scrutinized and endlessly discussed.\\n   \\n      But Hwang In-tae, who is the first Asian staff referee in the NBA, wouldn’t have it any other way.\\n   \\n      Hwang has come a long way since he used to put on a show for his university friends back in South Korea by dunking the basketball. An ability to dunk the ball isn’t a skill everyone possesses and Hwang’s display caught the attention of one watcher.\\n   \\n      Shin Gi-rok, who is three years older than Hwang and also attended Busan University of Foreign Studies, was impressed by the dunking show, but also spotted other areas for potential development.\\n   \\n      “A player needs to focus on the game, not how he looks. You need to play humble, but he was doing dunks to show off,” Shin told CNN Sport.\\n   \\n      “I didn’t scold him, it was more like pointing out not to do that, that he should show his true hardworking self, instead of trying to look cool.”\\n   \\n      Despite those flashes of athleticism and his love for basketball, Hwang’s dreams of playing proved short-lived. According to Shin, Hwang’s parents weren’t enthusiastic about a playing career and he also “wasn’t an elite player.”\\n   \\n      So Hwang was forced to turn to greener pastures for a future career, and in Shin, he had an ideal role model, as he had already made strides in transitioning into a career as a basketball referee.\\n   \\n      Since switching dunks and free-throws for whistles and ejections, Hwang has risen up the ranks of global refereeing and in this 2023-24 season, all his hard work will be rewarded as becomes the first NBA staff referee from outside of North America.\\n   \\n      “When In-tae left for America, I urged him not to come back midway and to come back after accomplishing his dream,” says Shin, explaining his pride in his refereeing protege.\\n   \\n      “I know it wasn’t an easy process for him. He travelled with his family, so I know he had various hardships, like environmental [cultural] issues, financial issues and many complex issues that made it uneasy for him. I saw him struggle midway. But he became a full-time referee, overcoming all that.\\n   \\n      “When I read the article [about Hwang becoming full-time], I was proud that he has finally made it: the first Asian referee. It’s an incredible achievement. Amazing and proud,” added Shin, who says whenever he traveled abroad other referees would ask him about In-tae and his NBA ambitions.\\n   \\n      Just like unearthing a future NBA or WNBA star, there is a scouting group to find potential standout NBA referees.\\n   \\n      According to nbaofficials.com, the goal for the NBA and WNBA is “to recruit referees from around the globe to become part of our team.”\\n   \\n      Perhaps no one embodies that more than Hwang, who went from domestic amateur leagues to becoming a regular in the professional Korean Basketball League. He’s also taken part in the Olympics, officiating in the 2016 Rio Summer Games, including the women’s gold medal game between the US and Spain.\\n   \\n      His excellence with FIBA (the International Basketball Federation) earned Hwang recognition by the NBA. He was inducted into the league’s education system before then refereeing in the G League – the NBA’s developmental league.\\n   \\n      Hwang’s journey to the NBA follows the prospective route mapped out by the league: 100 candidate officials are scouted from eight possible global basketball organizations and selected for evaluation events, eventually proceeding to the next phase, called the ‘officiating candidate pool.’\\n   \\n      The top candidates are then hired by the G League, working preseason games, as well as undergoing further mandatory training. Only then, will candidates be evaluated and recommended for hire into the NBA and WNBA.\\n   \\n      Hwang’s permanent promotion to the top of world basketball after two years in the G League – including last season’s Finals – and one season in the WNBA completes his remarkable career trajectory.\\n   \\n      “If any referee in the world gets a letter from the NBA, they would decide to come without even reading it,” Hwang, who also refereed seven regular-season games as a non-staff official last season, told the Washington Post. “I didn’t hesitate for one second. Am I dreaming?”\\n   \\n      Shin is now one of the leading officials in world basketball, traveling the globe to preside over international competitions as well as becoming a FIBA commissioner.\\n   \\n      Although Shin graduated from Busan University of Foreign Studies before Hwang, he continued to play basketball with the university’s basketball club occasionally while attending graduate school as a teaching assistant.\\n   \\n      As a result, he continued giving advice to Hwang as his compatriot began his journey to become a referee at the highest level.\\n   \\n      Dealing with a fast-paced game is one of the many challenges referees have and 11-time All-Star Charles Barkley admitted that officials have a “tough job” on their hands.\\n   \\n      “See, this is what I hate about fans. Of course, you get it right looking at five replays,” Barkley told CNN’s Chris Wallace in a recent interview. “You got in any sport, you got tremendous players moving at warp speed.\\n   \\n      “You got 10 guys; they’re moving, running up and down the court. They’re gonna miss some, but I don’t think any official goes to work and says, ‘Let me make a bad call that’s gonna change the outcome of a game,’ but also with replay now, I think it just made their job tougher.”\\n   \\n      Hwang himself describes refereeing was like an “addiction” to him. “After every single game, you feel so bad,” he told the Washington Post.\\n   \\n      “People were yelling at me. What I read in the rule book, I forgot during the game. It was terrible. I wanted to get better and better. I want to be perfect, but now I’ve learned from my classes that we cannot be perfect. We can only be excellent.”\\n   \\n      Both Hwang and Shin are internationally recognized referees registered under the Korean Basketball Association and the pair has worked together occasionally.\\n   \\n      Shin remembers reffing games together with Hwang at the 2014 Asian Games in Incheon, South Korea.\\n   \\n      And Shin believes that Hwang’s rise will prove to be motivation for others in similar positions to him.\\n   \\n      “I think it will inspire others,” Shin says. “There are few new referees at the Korea Basketball Association right now saying that their goal is to become an NBA referee.\\n   \\n      “It’s not easy, but In-tae showed that it is possible. He gave hope that if you try and put in the work, you could do it.”\\n   \\n      Although Shin admits the pair only chat once or twice a season nowadays, they continue to give feedback to one another when they can.\\n   \\n      But through Hwang’s journey from Masan, South Korea, to the NBA, Shin knows one thing shines through from his work: his “biggest passion in refereeing.”\\n   \\n      “He never falters during the game, avoids scandalous situations with team staffs and manages himself well. These are why he was always respected refereeing on the amateur [level] and the KBL. I think that’s why he was able to reach where he is today.”\\n  ',\n",

       "  'contents': ' \\n      A 23-year-old German-Israeli woman who was kidnapped from the Nova music festival by Hamas militants on October 7 has been declared dead, the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs has said.\\n   \\n      “We are devastated to share that the body of 23 year old German-Israeli Shani (Louk) was found and identified,” the ministry posted on X, formerly known as Twitter, on Monday.\\n   \\n      A source involved with her identification told CNN Louk’s death was announced after forensic examiners found a bone fragment from her skull.\\n   \\n      The bone fragment was from the\\xa0petrous part of the temporal bone, which is at the base of the skull, normally near the\\xa0carotid artery, a major blood vessel that provides blood to the brain.\\xa0A DNA test\\xa0concluded\\xa0the fragment\\xa0belonged to\\xa0Louk.\\n   \\n      “She was a beautiful, lively person,” Ricarda Louk, Shani’s mother, told CNN Tuesday, a day after her death was confirmed. “She just enjoyed laughing, and experiencing life, and so it was just cut too short.”\\n   \\nLouk\\xa0was attending the festival in southern Israel on October 7 when Hamas breached the border between Gaza and Israel.\\n   \\n      Louk was kidnapped at the festival and “tortured and paraded around Gaza by Hamas terrorists,” the foreign ministry statement said, adding that she “experienced unfathomable horrors.”\\n   \\n      The bone fragment, combined with the circumstances surrounding the October 7 attack and video that appeared to show\\xa0Louk\\xa0unconscious on the back of a Hamas truck, led investigators to conclude these were her remains.\\n   \\n      Militants blocked off the road to the festival from the north and the south during their October 7 attack, before swarming the sprawling site on foot, videos from the site showed.\\n   \\n      They then encircled the crowds on three sides, gunning them down and forcing them to flee over fields to the east.\\n   \\n      Louk’s mother told CNN earlier this month that she last spoke to her daughter after hearing rockets and alarms sounding in southern Israel, calling to see if she’d made it to a secure location. Shani told her mother she was at the festival with few places to hide.\\n   \\n      “She was going to her car and they had military people standing by the cars and were shooting so people couldn’t reach their cars, even to go away. And that’s when they took her,” Ricarda told CNN.\\n   \\n      On Tuesday, Louk’s mother said the festival had turned from “a celebration to a nightmare.”\\n   \\n      Describing her ordeal since her daughter’s abduction, Ricarda Louk added: After three weeks that you have no idea where your daughter is, what they’re doing to her… You don’t know if she’s alive or not, or injured, nothing. It’s just like you’re in a vacuum for three weeks, just hoping to get some signs.”\\n   \\n      “And then suddenly you get the worst news,” she said. “We always had hopes. We were optimistic that she would come back.”\\n   \\n      More than 260 bodies were found at the Nova festival site itself, according to Israeli rescue service Zaka but, based on\\xa0CNN’s analysis, the total death toll could be even higher.\\n   \\n      The body of Louk, a dual Israeli-German citizen, was seen on video seemingly unconscious on the back of a Hamas truck after the music festival attack.\\n   \\n      “After the video, you saw that, it’s impossible to see if she’s alive or dead. It was very scary, and we were very worried,”\\xa0Louk’s mother told CNN in the days after the rampage.\\n   \\n      Her mother added\\xa0that she had sought support from the German government in helping free her daughter. “I don’t understand really how such a brutal thing can just happen in the middle of the day and it was a complete surprise,”\\xa0Louk\\xa0said.\\n   \\n      A number of hostages were also taken back to Gaza. The latest figure of hostages believed to be held by Hamas in the enclave is up to\\xa0239, Israeli military spokesperson Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said on Sunday.\\n   \\n      An Israeli soldier, Pvt. Ori Megidish, who had been kidnapped by Hamas on October 7 was freed during ground operations in Gaza, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said Monday.\\n   \\n      “It indeed was a Special Operation that was targeted in specifically getting her out,” IDF spokesperson Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus told CNN’s Anderson Cooper on Tuesday, adding that the IDF’s initial announcement – which said the soldier was “released” – was a translation error.\\n   \\n      “Based on intelligence” the Israeli special forces went into northern Gaza knowing her whereabouts and rescued her, Conricus said. “They were in there for a job,” he said, adding that Megidish is “well mentally and physically,” and has been reunited with her family.\\n   \\n      Four hostages had previously been released – an American woman and her daughter, and later an 85-year-old Israeli woman and her 79-year-old friend.\\n   \\n      But Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is under increasing pressure from the families of hostages for a “comprehensive deal” to ensure their release. These calls are becoming more urgent amid concerns for what Israel’s expanding ground operations could mean for the safety of hostages trapped in Gaza.\\n   \\n      Netanyahu met with families of the hostages in Tel Aviv on Saturday, where they demanded answers on the security of their loved ones and pushed him to secure the hostages’ freedom, as Israel’s offensive escalated.\\n   \\n      “We spoke bluntly and made it clear to the prime minister in no uncertain terms that a comprehensive deal based on the ‘everyone for everyone’ principle is a deal the families would consider, and has the support of all of Israel,” Meirav Leshem Gonen, mother of Romi Gonen, who was\\xa0kidnapped from the festival, said on behalf of the families in a news conference following the meeting.\\n   \\n      An “everyone for everyone” deal would involve the release of the hostages in exchange for Palestinians currently held in Israeli prisons, which the nongovernmental organization Palestinian Prisoners Club estimates to be 6,630 people.\\n   \\n      On Monday, Hamas released a short video showing three women who are believed to be captives held by the Palestinian militant group.\\n   \\n      The video shows them seated in plastic chairs facing the camera, while the woman in the middle addresses Netanyahu directly with increasing fury. She makes reference to a press conference by families of the hostages “yesterday,” suggesting it was filmed on Monday.\\n   \\n      The women do not show visible signs of physical mistreatment, but CNN is unable to verify anything about their circumstances or well-being.\\n  ',\n",

       "  'contents': ' \\n      The entire population of Gaza is “being dehumanized,” the chief of the main UN agency operating there told the UN Security Council Monday, as pressure intensified on the besieged strip with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ruling out a ceasefire, saying “this\\xa0is a time for war.”\\n   \\n      Philippe Lazzarini, commissioner general of the UN Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) told the Security Council that thousands of children killed in Israeli airstrikes in Gaza in the past three weeks “cannot be collateral damage.”\\n   \\n      Major UN agencies are calling for a humanitarian ceasefire to allow deliveries of aid  for more than 2 million civilians trapped with scarce supplies of food, water and medical equipment, and for the safe release of 240 hostages that Israel believes are being held by Hamas, the militant group that controls the enclave.\\n   \\n      “An immediate humanitarian ceasefire has become a matter of life and death for millions,” Lazzarini said. The director of the UN\\xa0Office\\xa0for the Coordination of\\xa0Humanitarian\\xa0Affairs (OCHA), Lisa Doughten, told the Security Council that the “scale of the horror” being experienced by Gazans is “hard to convey.”\\n   \\n      “We simply do not have enough essential supplies to provide for the survival of internally displaced people at this scale,”\\xa0Doughten\\xa0said.\\n   \\n      However, Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu made clear on Monday that Israel would not agree to a ceasefire, as it responds with unrelenting force to Hamas’ October 7 terror attacks, which killed 1,400 people, mostly civilians, and saw hundreds taken hostage.\\n   \\n      Drawing parallels to the United States’ position after Pearl Harbor in 1941 and the September 11\\xa0attacks in 2001, Netanyahu said that while the Bible says there is a time for peace, “this\\xa0is a time for war.”\\n   \\n      “Calls for a ceasefire or calls for Israel to surrender to Hamas, to surrender to terrorists, surrender to barbarism, that will not happen,” he said.\\n   \\nHere’s the latest:\\n \\n      Gazans contended with another night of intense strikes into Tuesday, with the IDF firing artillery rounds and mortars and launching airstrikes. CNN teams saw numerous large explosions in northern Gaza.\\n   \\n      The IDF said it attacked hundreds of Hamas targets overnight. IDF spokesperson Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari\\xa0said Tuesday that “in combined and coordinated attacks by the ground and air forces, terrorists were eliminated.”\\n   \\n      On Monday, Israel vowed that its ground offensive in Gaza will\\xa0“intensify,” as CNN analysis suggested troops had advanced more than 2 miles (about 3 kilometers) into the enclave.\\n   \\n      Videos released by the IDF on Tuesday morning show Israeli soldiers on the ground in Gaza, progressing on foot and in tanks through rural areas as well as in what appears to be a significantly war-damaged urban district.\\n   \\n      IDF forces struck “approximately 300 targets” over the past day, including military compounds inside underground tunnels it said belonged to Hamas.\\n   \\n      Despite the intensified IDF ground operation, Hamas continued to fire rockets from Gaza. Alarms indicating incoming fire were activated in a number of areas around the Gaza perimeter overnight and early Tuesday.\\n   \\n      The Israeli military said Monday its troops killed\\xa0four prominent Hamas operatives\\xa0as part of its\\xa0expanded ground operations\\xa0in Gaza.\\n   \\n      Meanwhile, a Hamas spokesperson said Israel was not successful in entering Gaza “except in some limited areas” and described the humanitarian situation in the enclave as “disastrous.”\\n   \\n      At least 13 people, including children, were killed overnight when an Israeli airstrike hit a home in al-Zawaida in central Gaza’s Deir al Balah, Khalil Al Dikran, head of nursing at the Al Aqsa Martyrs Hospital, told a journalist working for CNN on Tuesday.\\n   \\n      The reporter, who was at the hospital on Tuesday morning, counted 44 bodies in the morgue tent being prepared for burial.\\n   \\n      The other casualties were killed in airstrikes Monday afternoon on two homes and a wedding hall sheltering residents displaced from northern Gaza, according to Al Dikran.\\n   \\n      Israel’s bombardment of Gaza has killed at least\\xa08,260 people, mostly civilians, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Ramallah, which draws the information from the Hamas-controlled enclave. More than 70% those killed are from vulnerable populations, including children, women and elderly individuals, the ministry said Monday.\\n   \\n      Among the dead are 64 UN aid workers, the highest number of UN aid workers killed in a conflict anywhere in the world in such a short period of time, according to UNRWA’s Lazzarini.\\n   \\n      The most recent death was a man called Samir who was killed alongside his wife and eight children, Lazzarini told the UN Security Council.\\n   \\n      “Those who are alive, have, for the most part, lost relatives, friends, neighbors and are displaced like the majority of Gazans,” he said, adding that despite the threat to their lives, they continue to “work tirelessly.”\\n   \\n      The conflict has also been the “deadliest period” for journalists covering Israel and Gaza since records began in 1992, according to the Committee to Protect\\xa0Journalists\\xa0(CPJ).\\n   \\n      At least 31\\xa0journalists\\xa0have been killed since October 7, including 26 Palestinians, four Israelis, and one Lebanese, the CPJ said, adding that it is investigating “numerous unconfirmed reports” of missing\\xa0journalists\\xa0and others who may been killed, detained, injured, or threatened.\\n   \\n      Speaking before the UN Security Council Monday, the\\xa0Palestinian\\xa0Authority’s Foreign Minister Riyad Al-Maliki said, “2.3 million\\xa0Palestinians in Gaza face death every day and every night” and pleaded with the council to “save them.”\\n   \\n      “Look at them as human beings. You cannot look only at one side and ignore this tragic humanity completely,” Al-Maliki said.\\n   \\n      Numerous hospitals in Gaza have borne the brunt of airstrikes and shelling, according to aid groups and health workers.\\n   \\n      In a social media post early Tuesday morning, the Palestine Red Crescent Society said the Tal Al Hawa neighborhood of Gaza City, in which\\xa0the\\xa0Al-Quds\\xa0hospital\\xa0is located, was under heavy “artillery and airstrikes.”\\n   \\n      “The building is trembling,” and those sheltering inside the\\xa0hospital\\xa0are “experiencing fear and panic,” the PRCS said.\\n   \\n      The organization said over the weekend that Israeli airstrikes have “caused extensive damage to hospital departments and exposed residents and patients to suffocation” at Al-Quds and accused Israel of “deliberately” launching airstrikes “directly next to” the facility in order to force an evacuation of the hospital, the second-largest in Gaza City.\\n   \\n      The facility is treating hundreds of patients, while some 12,000 internally displaced civilians are also sheltering there, the agency said.\\n   \\n      Gaza’s leading\\xa0cancer\\xa0hospital was also damaged in an Israeli attack, hospital director Sobhi Skaik told CNN on Monday, with its third floor suffering a direct hit causing damage to oxygen and water supplies.

       " {'headline': '\\n      An anti-Jewish riot in Russia’s Dagestan region shows the risks of Putin’s balancing act on Hamas\\n    ',\n",
       "  'contents': ' \\n      Russian President Vladimir Putin prides himself as the leader of what he calls a “multinational, multiconfessional” Russia. And the republic of Dagestan is in many ways a microcosm of Russia’s diversity: The mountainous region is home to over 30 ethnic groups with distinct languages.\\n   \\n      But the images of antisemitic rioters overrunning Dagestan’s Makhachkala Uytash Airport\\xa0have shaken Russia’s Jewish community, stoked international outrage and raised serious questions about the blowback from Putin’s war on Ukraine –\\xa0now in the Russian leader’s view directly linked to events in Gaza.\\n   \\n      On Monday, the Kremlin leader held an extensive meeting to address the situation in Dagestan,\\xa0where rioters – fired\\xa0up\\xa0by rumors that Jews and Israelis were aboard a\\xa0Red Wings Airlines flight\\xa0that landed Sunday from Tel Aviv – surged into the airport terminal and stormed the runway.\\n   \\n      Members of the crowd outside the airport held signs that included slogans such as “We are against Jewish refugees,” and “There is no place for child-killers in Dagestan.”\\n   \\n      According to Russian state news agency\\xa0TASS, “those gathered oppose the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.”\\n   \\n      Authorities said at least 20 people were injured and 60 people were detained. State Department Spokesperson Matthew Miller said the incident “looked like a pogrom.”\\n   \\n      The\\xa0Israeli\\xa0Prime Minister’s office and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs\\xa0released a joint statement\\xa0on Sunday following the news, saying\\xa0Israel expected Russian law enforcement “to safeguard the well-being of all\\xa0Israeli\\xa0citizens and Jews wherever they are and to take strong action against the rioters and against the wild incitement being directed against Jews and\\xa0Israelis.”\\n   \\n      In his remarks Monday, Putin called for law enforcement to take “firm, timely and precise actions to help protect constitutional order of Russia, rights and liberties of our citizens, the interethnic and inter-religious harmony.”\\n   \\n      But the Kremlin leader also directed the finger of blame away from Russia.\\n   \\n      “The events in Makhachkala last night were inspired through social networks,” Putin stated, insinuating that Ukraine and “the hands of Western intelligence agencies” had exploited emotions running high inside Dagestan over Israel’s relentless military campaign against Hamas in Gaza and rising civilian casualties.\\n   \\n      “We can only help Palestine in the fight against those who are behind this tragedy,” Putin said, adding, “we, Russia, are fighting them within the framework of the Special Military Operation,” the official euphemism for Russia’s ongoing war in Ukraine.\\n   \\n      Such remarks require serious unpacking.\\n   \\n      Since the October 7 Hamas attacks, Putin has played a delicate international balancing act, putting himself forward as a potential mediator and calling for restraint on both sides – a position that has won praise from Hamas.\\n   \\n      And in his remarks on Monday, Putin made his most pointed critique of Israel to date, saying\\xa0that\\xa0“horrifying events” in the Gaza Strip “cannot not be justified” and added that “your fists clench and you get tears in your eyes” when you see photos of “bloodied, dead children.”\\n   \\n      Such images clearly stirred anger in Dagestan, a\\xa0majority Muslim\\xa0republic that has historically been home to a variety of Islamic religious practices.\\n   \\n      It has a miniscule Jewish population – Judaism is one of Dagestan’s long-established religions, practiced by communities of the Mountain Jews, who speak a form of Persian – but after centuries of coexistence with Muslim neighbors, that population has dwindled through emigration.\\n   \\n      But Putin’s calls to contain the Gaza crisis in recent days have riled Israel.\\xa0Russia’s ambassador to\\xa0Israel was summoned to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Jerusalem to protest a visit last week to Moscow by a\\xa0Hamas\\xa0delegation, according to a press release from\\xa0Israel’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Sunday.\\n   \\n      Putin, however, is playing to different audiences. Russia has a complex web of relationships in the Middle East: Putin backs Syrian President Bashar al-Assad (an enemy of Israel); he relies on Iran (another enemy of Israel) for a stockpile of drones to attack Ukraine; and he’s a high-fiving friend of\\xa0Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, another power player in the region.\\n   \\n      He has also maintained cordial working relationships with Israeli counterparts, although his relationship with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has cooled.\\n   \\n      But such regional dynamics obscure a bigger picture. Putin has cast himself as locked in an existential fight against the United States and the West, with Ukraine the main battleground. His rhetoric – directed against “those who are behind this tragedy” – now appears to draw a direct line between Ukraine and Gaza.\\n   \\n      In his remarks Monday, Putin\\xa0accused the US of stoking the current conflict, stating “the United States needs constant chaos in the Middle East, so they discredit those countries that are insisting on the immediate ceasefire in the Gaza Strip.”\\n   \\n      In response to Moscow,\\xa0National Security Council Coordinator for Strategic Communications John\\xa0Kirby said, “we’ve heard crickets from the Kremlin,” on the airport mob.\\n   \\n      “Nothing, no condemnation, no calling for the stoppage of hate, discrimination and bigotry,” Kirby said,\\xa0adding,\\xa0“It’s classic Russian rhetoric that when something goes like bad in your country … blame somebody else, blame it on outside influences.”\\n   \\n      Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said the Dagestan riot signals that Russia is “losing control.”\\n   \\n      Observers have also been quick to note that Putin’s expressed concern over civilian casualties in Gaza rings hollow.\\n   \\n      His military continues a ruthless war against Ukraine, a campaign that has targeted civilian infrastructure and leveled cities, and the International Criminal Court (ICC) has issued an arrest warrant\\xa0for the Russian president over his country’s conduct during the war.\\n   \\n      But Putin is counting on\\xa0a strategy that has already won dividends: Internationally, Moscow’s diplomats have been pressing a global PR offensive that casts Russia as a staunch anticolonial power, winning support in the Global South –\\xa0even as it pursues a war of conquest in Ukraine.\\n   \\n      Russian state media have echoed that narrative at home. Since the October 7 Hamas attacks on Israel, some Russian state TV commentators and politicians have ramped up their criticism of Israel, as the Gaza war conveniently distracts international attention from Ukraine.\\n   \\n      Ukrainian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Oleh Nikolenko accused Moscow of trying to shift responsibility. “Threats to exterminate the Jews are the result of the work of Russian state propaganda, which for decades cultivated feelings of hatred towards other peoples among Russians,” he noted.\\n   \\n      But as the riots in Dagestan showed, anti-Israel rhetoric can veer quickly off script.\\n   \\n      Earlier this month, Ramzan Kadyrov, the pro-Kremlin warlord who rules the neighboring Russian republic of Chechnya,\\xa0expressed “complete support” for Palestine and floated the notion of deploying his “peacemaking” forces to resolve the conflict between Israel and Hamas.\\n   \\n      That may seem a farfetched idea – Kadyrov has an abysmal human rights-record\\xa0– but for nearly two decades, the Chechen strongman has helped Putin keep a brutal, uneasy peace in Russia’s north Caucasus, a region that includes Dagestan. Kadyrov has also provided footsoldiers for Russia’s war in Ukraine.\\n   \\n      So keeping the peace in Dagestan\\xa0is likely focusing minds in the Kremlin. Protests erupted last year in the republic in response to the Russian government’s mobilization orders, with some activists complaining that ethnic minorities were being unfairly conscripted for service in Ukraine. The Gaza war adds one more match to the fire.\\n   \\n      In a keenly observed commentary on Sunday’s events, Harold Chambers of the independent Russia-watching site Riddle Russia pointed to Dagestan’s dismal economic state and the Ukraine war as factors fuelling local grievance.\\n   \\n      “The attempted pogrom is\\xa0not just rooted in\\xa0antisemitic messaging, but in\\xa0systemic dynamics in\\xa0the region,” he wrote.\\n   \\n      “General socioeconomic conditions in\\xa0the republic continue to\\xa0deteriorate. Basic necessities to\\xa0live such as\\xa0electricity, water, and gas are irregularly supplied, which led to\\xa0sustained small\\xa0protests\\xa0only a\\xa0few months ago. Additionally, Russia’s war in\\xa0Ukraine has\\xa0impacted\\xa0Dagestan heavily, with significant casualties. Public appeals and small actions do\\xa0not regularly succeed, with the authorities sweeping them aside.”\\n   \\n      Russian investigative journalist Yevgenia Albats was equally cutting in her analysis.\\n   \\n      “Are there anti-Semites in Makhachkala?” she wrote on X. “Yes, sure. Have they been there before? Yes, sure. What has happened now? 20 months of war, rising prices, hundreds, if not thousands of men killed, the pressure is accumulating and requires a release.”\\n   \\n      Russia’s information campaign, she added, is a convenient tool, presenting “a picture for the Middle East, Iran, for the Global South: Russia is with you, Putin is the leader of the anti-American world.”\\n   \\n      Putin has for months played a risky geopolitical game, gambling on anti-Western distrust to shore up support for his war on Ukraine. But an anti-Jewish riot in the southern region of Dagestan shows how quickly that model can backfire, particularly for those trapped inside the echo of Russian state propaganda.\\n  ',\n",

       "  'contents': ' \\n      Fuel is a lifeline for more than 2 million people in Gaza who, three weeks into the siege, are suffering from dire shortages of basic supplies and medical care. The lack of fuel has crippled hospitals, water systems, bakeries and relief operations in the strip, and the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) warned on Sunday that aid convoy system in Gaza “is geared to fail” if Israel continues to ban fuel.\\n   \\n      Amid the threat of vital infrastructure collapsing without fuel, thousands of desperate Palestinians broke into the UNRWA’s warehouses for supplies on Saturday.\\n   \\n      The enclave has gone without any fuel deliveries for almost three weeks since the Israeli government ordered a “complete siege” on October 9 and halted food, fuel, water and electricity supplies after Hamas’ attack left more than 1,400 Israelis dead.\\n   \\n      Nearly all fuel has been exhausted and UN officials are warning that hospitals are on the brink of collapse without the ability to run backup generators to treat people.\\n   \\n      As of Monday morning, 118 aid trucks with food, water and medical supplies have entered Gaza through the Rafah crossing. Israel began allowing a limited number of trucks through on October 21 but has continued to refuse fuel, saying Hamas would use it to launch weapons.\\n   \\n      The Israel military says there are fuel supplies in Gaza being held by Hamas which are not being distributed for humanitarian purposes, CNN reported.\\n   \\n      The main UN agency in Gaza has said it will have to stop operating when fuel runs out, which was expected on October 25, though some operations have continued by severe rationing.\\n   \\n      Gaza cannot produce food or clean water without electricity or fuel.\\n   \\n      More than 2 million people in the strip are at risk of contracting waterborne disease as they drink salty and polluted water from farm wells. Bakeries supported by the World Food Programme cannot operate due to airstrike damage and lack of power, officials said.\\n   \\n      On October 22, the UNRWA managed to coordinate fuel retrieval from a storage facility in Gaza and distributed it to shelters and hospitals and to operate desalination plants in Khan Younis and Deir al-Balah, now producing 30% of their capacity. But this supply is also expected to run out soon.\\n   \\n      UNRWA officials say rescue operations, hampered by a lack of fuel for vehicles, are unable to reach at least 940 missing children as of October 29, who may be trapped under collapsed buildings.\\n   \\n      Fuel shortages have also forced six hospitals to close, while others have shut down due to airstrike damage, the World Health Organization has reported. Hospitals that remain in operation are being forced to ration care.\\n   \\n      Gaza’s fuel crisis affects its ability to generate power, which was already inadequate before the siege.\\n   \\n      Gaza’s main sources of electricity are its single power plant in Deir al-Balah and from Israeli lines, which make up nearly two-thirds of Gaza’s power supply.\\n   \\n      The power plant ran out of fuel two weeks ago, and the country has had to rely on generators for electricity. All other electricity from Israel was also cut off on the evening of Hamas’ attack on October 7.\\n   \\n      The 140-square-mile enclave, blockaded by Israel since 2007, relies heavily on imported fuel and electricity to run all its services.\\n   \\n      A majority share of Gaza’s fuel imports goes towards operating the power plant, which Qatar has helped fund since late 2018, increasing its fuel supply from 30 million liters in 2018 to over 130 million liters annually up to 2022.\\n   \\n      Without additional fuel supplies going into the enclave, current shortages are deepening the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, and hospitals and relief workers have to make tough choices about how to allocate their diminishing reserves.\\n  ',\n",

And in some of the tunnels, you need to bend down because they’re not very high.\\n   \\n      When you enter one of these tunnels very quickly, you lose your sense of direction completely — where you came from, where you’re going. It’s easy to get completely disoriented and confused quickly, and some people have major trouble with that.\\n   \\n      In addition to the claustrophobia, you lose your sense of time, so you might feel like you’ve been there for two hours, but it’s only really been 20 minutes.\\n   \\nBergen: How is Hamas communicating inside these tunnels? Because presumably, radio communication and that kind of thing doesn’t work.\\n \\nRichemond Barak:\\xa0So, cell phones, of course, are out of the question. It has implications for Hamas, which, to exploit this network of tunnels needs to figure out a way to be able to communicate among themselves, but it also has implications for the IDF (Israel Defense Forces). If they go down inside the tunnels, how do they maintain communication between the units underground but also with the forces above ground?\\n   \\nBergen: The tunnel training facility that the Israelis have — tell us the history of that and how it works.\\n \\nRichemond Barak:\\xa0After the wake-up call of 2014\\xa0Operation Protective Edge\\xa0in Gaza (Israel’s campaign against Hamas involving both airstrikes and ground raids that took\\xa050 days), Israel started looking at the underground tunnel issue as a strategic issue.\\n   \\n      Israeli soldiers went into Hamas’ tunnels during\\xa0Operation Protective Edge, and they were not trained and not equipped, and there was combat in the tunnels.\\n   \\n      As a result of Operation Protective Edge, Israel took a lot of measures not only for the detection techniques of tunnels but also to train in this subterranean environment.\\n   \\n      They created elite units that are very well-versed in all\\xa0aspects of underground warfare.\\n   \\n      In addition, they started basic training in underground warfare for soldiers so they would know how to bypass a tunnel or neutralize a tunnel and then what equipment would be needed if they had to go down there. You need to be prepared for a different kind of environment but also a different kind of fight.\\n   \\n      IDF also used simulators where you put these\\xa0virtual reality goggles on, which would then take you inside the virtual tunnel. But it’s not the same as being in a tunnel. To experience it, you need to be inside an actual tunnel, and then one of the challenges you face there is decision-making: What do you do if you find a door? Do you breach the door? How do you breach the door?\\n   \\nBergen: Why tunnels?\\n \\nRichemond Barak:\\xa0Why tunnels? The digging of tunnels is a very time-consuming and resource-intensive kind of work. It takes a long time to dig. You need to keep the location of the tunnels secret. So the point is, there’s a huge investment there. When you go inside the tunnel, this investment hits you in such a powerful way, especially in the Hezbollah tunnels, because they are near Israel’s northern border, where it’s hard rock that you must tunnel through — or more accurately in this case — excavate.\\n   \\n      Tunnels neutralize the military capability of a more sophisticated enemy. It serves as a great equalizer between the two sides.\\n   \\nBergen:\\xa0Regarding\\xa0Gilad Shalit, the Israeli soldier who was held hostage by Hamas between 2006 and 2011. Reading your book, I realize tunnels played an important role when he was taken. Can you explain how that happened?\\n \\nRichemond Barak:\\xa0What Hamas did was they used smuggling tunnels to bring Shalit into captivity, and it was a surprise because this was not what\\xa0these tunnels\\xa0had been used for until then. And Israel was surprised and suddenly realized, wait a second, maybe we should pay more attention to these tunnels because the kidnapping of an IDF soldier is considered a major strategic event. After all, Israel had to release some\\xa01,000 Palestinian prisoners\\xa0to get Shalit back.\\n   \\nBergen: For the Israelis, one of their significant concerns now must surely be that these tunnels could be used to take additional soldiers as hostages.\\n \\nRichemond Barak:\\xa0Absolutely. Kidnappings of soldiers are always perceived in Israel as a strategic kind of event. So, additional kidnappings would be devastating at this stage.\\n   \\nBergen: How big a role will the tunnels play in this war?\\n \\nRichemond Barak:\\xa0Israel understands that to eliminate or destroy Hamas’ military capabilities, this subterranean network of tunnels, where Hamas has its arsenal and command and control, needs to be eliminated. I won’t say entirely eliminated because I believe it’s impossible. But it needs to be a significant blow to this capability, much more severe than what was done during Operation Protective Edge.\\n   \\n      It’s terrain that Hamas knows so well, in which it maneuvers with ease, and they don’t get lost inside their tunnels. It’s not that different from what ISIS did in Mosul, Iraq, or Raqqa in Syria; this was ISIS’ last-resort measure when it came to fighting the coalition fighting against ISIS. The fight moved to the underground.\\n   \\n      But to achieve the strategic aim, which is to eliminate Hamas’ underground military infrastructure, the way to do that is not via an above-ground incursion.\\n   \\nBergen: Is\\xa0a dog force\\xa0used by Israel inside tunnels?\\xa0\\n \\nRichemond Barak:\\xa0Yes, dogs are trained to go into this environment.\\n   \\nBergen: What about robots?\\n \\nRichemond Barak:\\xa0What you need for such a robot is the ability to walk in wet terrain because there’s water usually at the bottom of a tunnel. It’s moist. You need them to be able to go up ladders or staircases.\\n   \\nBergen: What else might work?\\n \\nRichemond Barak:\\xa0High-pressure water would cause a collapse of the structures of the tunnels. It attacks the tunnel structure in a much more significant way than just flooding it with regular water. Remember that the ground can absorb some of the water.\\n   \\n      Now, there could be civilians in the tunnels, and most likely, there could be hostages; you need to clear the tunnels first. If they’re inside the tunnel, then it’s obviously more difficult. And I wouldn’t use the high-pressure water.\\n   \\nBergen: What about Hezbollah’s tunnels should the war widen?\\n \\nRichemond Barak:\\xa0To illustrate how difficult it is to detect tunnels, refer to\\xa0Operation Northern Shield. This is the operation that Israel launched in 2018 to expose the cross-border tunnels that Hezbollah had dug.\\n   \\n      This is after Israel had dramatically improved its detection techniques, but this is in a different kind of terrain because Hezbollah must tunnel through hard rock, whereas in Gaza, it is soft soil.\\n   \\n      It took Israel — even though there were no hostilities — six weeks to detect\\xa0six tunnels.\\n   \\n      Even if you have intelligence, even if you’ve narrowed down the area where you suspect tunnels are located, even if you have the most sophisticated and available means of detecting tunnels, it will still take you a considerable amount of time to find the tunnels.\\n  ',\n",

       "  'contents': ' \\n      Touching the side of his neck gingerly, 30-year-old Withawat Kunwong reveals a jagged network of scars he received after being attacked at a poultry farm where he had been working in southern Israel.\\n   \\n      The wound, Kunwong says, is a painful reminder of the fear and trauma he endured on October 7 when thousands of Hamas fighters broke through Israel’s border defenses in an unprecedented surprise attack.\\n   \\n      The farm he had been working on was located in the Holit kibbutz, an agrarian community near the Gaza Strip. He was livestreaming from the farm when loud explosions were heard and thick black plumes of smoke rose into the air as rockets flew overheard.\\n   \\n      He recalled hiding for hours that day but was discovered by a man he recalled as being a Palestinian dressed in civilian clothes who tried to cut his throat with a kitchen knife, after he “refused to surrender”. A savage fight ensued.\\n   \\n      After the violent struggle with his attacker, Kunwong was left for dead, heavily bleeding from the wound in his throat. He was eventually found and cared for by other migrant workers. He managed to survive, he believes, because the knife had been blunt and broken.\\n   \\n      \\ufeff“He couldn’t finish the job,” he told CNN. “This injury still hurts but I feel the hurt inside more,” he added.\\n   \\n      His story is a tragic illustration of the human toll of the ongoing war that has claimed thousands of lives in both Israel and Gaza and displaced more than a million people in the Hamas-controlled territory.\\n   \\n      Hamas has described its brutal attack as an assault on Israel. But so many of those murdered and kidnapped by the militant group’s fighters were also foreign nationals.\\n   \\n      According to an estimate released by the\\xa0Israeli Government Press Office last week, 135\\xa0hostages holding\\xa0foreign\\xa0passports from 25 different countries are being held in the Gaza Strip.\\n   \\n      Among many of the foreign nationals killed and kidnapped are migrant laborers like Kunwong from Asian countries such as Thailand, Nepal and the Philippines – many who were working in Israel’s southern district near the Gaza strip, and unprotected, when Hamas militants came.\\n   \\n      Thailand, for decades, h\\ufeffas been one of Israel’s biggest sources of migrant labor.\\n   \\n      At least 32 Thais have been killed in the conflict to date, one of the highest death tolls for foreign nationals, according to figures released by the Thai government. \\n \\n      “No worker – Israeli or Thai – should be used as cannon fodder,” said Yahel Kurlander, an academic from Tel-Hai College in northern Israel who has been focusing her research on labor issues in Israel’s agriculture industry.\\n   \\n      Working with aid groups on the ground, Kurlander said that while the majority of Thai workers left in Israel are “totally safe”, supporting their families back home remained a key priority. And they feel pressured on two sides.\\n   \\n      “The Thai government is asking them to evacuate and leave Israel but there is also pressure is from the Israeli side, telling them: ‘We need you, stay, we’ll give you extra money for that,” Kurlander said, adding that they deserved compensation.\\n   \\n      For migrant laborers working in Israel’s agricultural, construction and healthcare sectors, there is little sign the war is going to ease any time soon.\\n   \\n      Heavy fighting continues daily and the UN has warned that “civil order” in Gaza was deteriorating following weeks of siege and bombardment. Israel has expanded its ground operation inside Gaza in what Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has called the “next stage of war.”\\n   \\n      Palestinians experienced what they have described as the heaviest and\\xa0most intense round of airstrikes so far overnight, taking shelter from the bombardment\\xa0in hospitals. A\\xa0communications blackout\\xa0has disrupted emergency services and cut off contact between family members. Some communications were restored Sunday morning\\n   \\n      Many of the kibbutz farm fields on the Israeli side of the border that were targeted by Hamas now echo with the sound of artillery fire from tanks and howitzers bombardinng the crowded strip.\\n   \\n      The Thai government has called for the release of all remaining citizens being held in Gaza. So far at least 33 Thai nationals have been killed, according to figures shared by Thai authorities with CNN – with 18 Thai nationals still being held hostage as of October 26.\\n   \\n      “We reiterate our strong call for the release of the remaining hostages, including our nationals, as soon as possible,” Deputy Prime Minister Parnpree Bahiddha-Nukara said, adding that those kidnapped and killed had mostly been farm workers who were there to earn a living and had “no involvement in the conflict.”\\n   \\n      Like many Thai migrant laborers working in Israel, Kunwong is from Udon Thani, one of Thailand’s poorest provinces. Life there is a far cry from the air-conditioned malls and traffic clogged streets of Bangkok. Jobs are harder to come by and wages are much lower, leading many to seek employment thousands of miles from home.\\n   \\n      Families told CNN that, despite the conflict in Israel, Thai migrant workers were under pressure to honor contracts specifying minimum five years of labor – a heavy price to pay to support their families back home.\\n   \\n      Groups like Aid for Agricultural Workers (AAW), which support foreign migrants, have highlighted what they call “extreme challenges” experienced by many, saying it was still “business as usual” in Israel.\\n   \\n      Zohar Shvarzberg of AAW said there were increasing reports of laborers who were pressured to return to their former workplaces in order to receive their wages for September, the month before the initial Hamas attack.\\n   \\n      “We empathize with the distress caused to farmers and farming communities by the labor shortage but no person should be forced to be where they feel unsafe,” she said. Following announcements by Thailand’s embassy in Tel Aviv that rescue flights would operate daily, she added, there was now a “fear of increasing pressure on Thai workers to stay and work, including through unethical and illegal means.”\\n   \\n      Kunwong was one of the more fortunate Thai workers who made it out of Israel and has reunited with his wife and young daughter in Udon Thani.\\n   \\n      The family of another young Thai worker, Manee Jirachart, 29, who previously spoke to CNN, reiterated hopes their son would eventually return home safely.\\n   \\n      Manee had been working as a cleaner at a government office in southern Israel near Gaza for nearly five years when he was abducted and taken hostage by Hamas militants.\\n   \\n      Speaking to CNN from the blue painted home Manee’s wages helped pay for, his father Chumporn made a tearful plea.\\n   \\n       “I have no words,” he said. “I just want my son back.”\\n  ',\n",

       "  'contents': ' \\n      The cast of “Friends” is taking time to “grieve and process” the death of their former co-star Matthew Perry.\\n   \\n      In a joint statement provided to CNN on Monday, Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, David Schwimmer and Matt LeBlanc wrote: “We are all so utterly devastated by the loss of Matthew. We were more than just cast mates. We are a family.”\\n   \\n      “There is so much to say, but right now we’re going to take a moment to grieve and process this unfathomable loss,” the statement, released by their individual representatives, continued. “In time we will say more, as and when we are able. For now, our thoughts and our love are with Matty’s family, his friends, and everyone who loved him around the world.”\\n   \\n      Perry died Saturday at his home in the Los Angeles area. He was 54.\\n   \\n      Perry, 54, starred on the NBC sitcom “Friends” from 1994 to 2004 as\\xa0Chandler Bing, the charming and sarcastic member of a group of tight-knit friends living in New York City. The show was one of the most popular of its era and has continued to reach young audiences on streaming platforms.\\n   \\n      In his role, Perry was nominated for an Emmy in 2002 for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series, and he was also nominated in 2021 for executive producing the “Friends: The Reunion” special on what was then known as HBO Max.\\n   \\n      Perry was found “unconscious in a stand-alone jacuzzi,” according to a statement from the Los Angeles Fire Department provided to CNN on Monday.\\n   \\n      “A bystander had brought the man’s head above the water and gotten him to the edge, then Firefighters removed him from the water upon their arrival,” they said when asked about the incident at Perry’s address. “A rapid medical assessment, sadly, revealed the man was deceased prior to first responder arrival.”\\n   \\n      The LACFD said the circumstances are being investigated by the Los Angeles Police Department and the Los Angeles County Medical Examiner, but there is currently no foul play suspected, a law enforcement source told CNN.\\n   \\n      An autopsy has been conducted, but examiners are awaiting the results of toxicology reports in order to determine Perry’s cause of death, the medical examiner’s office told CNN on Sunday. Such reports can take weeks to complete.\\n   \\n      On Sunday,\\xa0“Friends” co-creators Marta Kauffman and David Crane and executive producer Kevin Bright released a statement to CNN, saying they were “shocked and deeply, deeply saddened by our beloved friend Matthew’s passing.”\\n   \\n      “We will always cherish the joy, the light, the blinding intelligence he brought to every moment - not just to his work, but in life as well. He was always the funniest person in the room,” the statement said. “More than that, he was the sweetest, with a giving and selfless heart…This truly is The One Where Our Hearts Are Broken.”\\n   \\n      The chemistry between the cast of “Friends” stretched far beyond their on-screen dynamic. The actors have remained close since the show ended in 2004.\\n   \\n      In an emotional moment on HBO Max’s “Friends: The Reunion” special in 2021, Perry said that anytime they’d run into each other “that was the end of the night. You just stay with the person all night long and that was it.”\\n   \\n      Perry’s castmates have also at times helped him work through his struggles with addiction. In his memoir, he\\xa0recounted\\xa0how a visit to his trailer from Aniston made him realize that his battle with alcoholism wasn’t as secret as he thought.\\n   \\n      “‘I know you’re drinking,’ she said,” Perry wrote, later adding that being “confronted” by Aniston about his drinking was “devastating.”\\n   \\n      Their close connection as a group carried over into their business dealings as well.\\n   \\n      In 1996, the cast employed a then-landmark negotiation tactic to strike new deals with their studio:\\xa0sticking together. By the end of the show’s run, each primary cast member was making\\xa0$1 million per episode.\\n   \\n      “It’s a very loving, tight knit group,” Perry said during a 2021\\xa0interview\\xa0with Entertainment Tonight.\\n   \\n      “When we see each other, it’s a very heartwarming thing,” he added.\\n   \\nCNN’s Taylor Romine,\\xa0Josh Campbell,\\xa0Cheri Mossburg, Dan Heching and Lisa Respers France contributed to this report.\\n',\n",

       "  'contents': ' \\n      The cast of “Friends” is taking time to “grieve and process” the death of their former co-star Matthew Perry.\\n   \\n      In a joint statement provided to CNN on Monday, Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, David Schwimmer and Matt LeBlanc wrote: “We are all so utterly devastated by the loss of Matthew. We were more than just cast mates. We are a family.”\\n   \\n      “There is so much to say, but right now we’re going to take a moment to grieve and process this unfathomable loss,” the statement, released by their individual representatives, continued. “In time we will say more, as and when we are able. For now, our thoughts and our love are with Matty’s family, his friends, and everyone who loved him around the world.”\\n   \\n      Perry died Saturday at his home in the Los Angeles area. He was 54.\\n   \\n      Perry, 54, starred on the NBC sitcom “Friends” from 1994 to 2004 as\\xa0Chandler Bing, the charming and sarcastic member of a group of tight-knit friends living in New York City. The show was one of the most popular of its era and has continued to reach young audiences on streaming platforms.\\n   \\n      In his role, Perry was nominated for an Emmy in 2002 for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series, and he was also nominated in 2021 for executive producing the “Friends: The Reunion” special on what was then known as HBO Max.\\n   \\n      Perry was found “unconscious in a stand-alone jacuzzi,” according to a statement from the Los Angeles Fire Department provided to CNN on Monday.\\n   \\n      “A bystander had brought the man’s head above the water and gotten him to the edge, then Firefighters removed him from the water upon their arrival,” they said when asked about the incident at Perry’s address. “A rapid medical assessment, sadly, revealed the man was deceased prior to first responder arrival.”\\n   \\n      The LACFD said the circumstances are being investigated by the Los Angeles Police Department and the Los Angeles County Medical Examiner, but there is currently no foul play suspected, a law enforcement source told CNN.\\n   \\n      An autopsy has been conducted, but examiners are awaiting the results of toxicology reports in order to determine Perry’s cause of death, the medical examiner’s office told CNN on Sunday. Such reports can take weeks to complete.\\n   \\n      On Sunday,\\xa0“Friends” co-creators Marta Kauffman and David Crane and executive producer Kevin Bright released a statement to CNN, saying they were “shocked and deeply, deeply saddened by our beloved friend Matthew’s passing.”\\n   \\n      “We will always cherish the joy, the light, the blinding intelligence he brought to every moment - not just to his work, but in life as well. He was always the funniest person in the room,” the statement said. “More than that, he was the sweetest, with a giving and selfless heart…This truly is The One Where Our Hearts Are Broken.”\\n   \\n      The chemistry between the cast of “Friends” stretched far beyond their on-screen dynamic. The actors have remained close since the show ended in 2004.\\n   \\n      In an emotional moment on HBO Max’s “Friends: The Reunion” special in 2021, Perry said that anytime they’d run into each other “that was the end of the night. You just stay with the person all night long and that was it.”\\n   \\n      Perry’s castmates have also at times helped him work through his struggles with addiction. In his memoir, he\\xa0recounted\\xa0how a visit to his trailer from Aniston made him realize that his battle with alcoholism wasn’t as secret as he thought.\\n   \\n      “‘I know you’re drinking,’ she said,” Perry wrote, later adding that being “confronted” by Aniston about his drinking was “devastating.”\\n   \\n      Their close connection as a group carried over into their business dealings as well.\\n   \\n      In 1996, the cast employed a then-landmark negotiation tactic to strike new deals with their studio:\\xa0sticking together. By the end of the show’s run, each primary cast member was making\\xa0$1 million per episode.\\n   \\n      “It’s a very loving, tight knit group,” Perry said during a 2021\\xa0interview\\xa0with Entertainment Tonight.\\n   \\n      “When we see each other, it’s a very heartwarming thing,” he added.\\n   \\nCNN’s Taylor Romine,\\xa0Josh Campbell,\\xa0Cheri Mossburg, Dan Heching and Lisa Respers France contributed to this report.\\n',\n",

Elizabeth Warren over her proposed wealth tax, is cautioning voters against returning Donald Trump to the White House.\\n   \\n      “It would be terrible for the country if Donald Trump were reelected,” Cooperman told CNN in a phone interview late last week. “He’s a divisive human being who belongs in jail.”\\n   \\n      It’s rare for a Wall Street figure to make such critical comments about Trump, at least publicly.\\n   \\n      Cooperman, in the past, has donated to mostly Republicans and forcefully battled with Warren over her proposed Ultra-Millionaire Tax.\\n \\n      But the billionaire has previously said he voted for Joe Biden in 2020 “very reluctantly.”\\n   \\n      Cooperman told CNN he’s not thrilled with the prospect of a Biden-Trump rematch in 2024, calling them both “bad choices.” Cooperman said he expects neither Trump nor Biden will be their party’s respective nominee next fall. But Cooperman added that if it is a Biden-Trump rematch, he likely won’t vote.\\n   \\n      “I’m looking for centrists, not radical left or right,” said Cooperman, who donated to Republican Chris Christie’s 2024 campaign over the summer, according to federal records.\\n \\n      In response, Trump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung said Trump “will be the nominee and will beat Biden because he’s the only person who can supercharge the economy, secure our border, safeguard communities and put an end to unnecessary wars.”\\n   \\n      “Americans want to return to a prosperous nation and there’s only one person who can do that – President Trump,” Cheung said in a statement.\\n   \\n      The Biden campaign did not respond to a request for comment.\\n   \\n      On the economic front, Cooperman expressed concern about risks posed by the violence in the Middle East.\\n   \\n      The CEO of Omega Advisors said he’s “absolutely” worried there will be a financial impact from the conflict, adding that recent selling on Wall Street suggests the stock market is “catching up with reality now.”\\n   \\n      The World Bank on Monday warned that a wider war risks pushing global commodity markets, including oil, into “uncharted waters.”\\n \\n      A small disruption, such as the one during the Libyan civil war, could lift oil prices to as high as $102 a barrel, according to the World Bank analysis. A medium-level disruption would spike oil to $121 a barrel, while a severe disruption like the 1973 Arab oil embargo could cause oil to skyrocket up to $157 a barrel.\\n   \\n      Given the ongoing risks, Cooperman argued the stock market is overvalued relative to corporate profits.\\n   \\n      “The question is whether the market deserves to be selling at 18, 19 or 20 times earnings. The answer is no,” he said. “We have a hostile government towards capital. We’re fighting two wars. And we have stupid monetary and fiscal policies that have brought demand forward.”\\n   \\n      Cooperman expressed alarm about the lack of fiscal “discipline” in Washington among both political parties, pointing to how the national debt has spiked from $20 trillion in 2017 when Trump took office to more than $33 trillion today.\\n  ',\n",

       "  'contents': ' \\n      The 14th Amendment\\xa0disqualification trial against Donald Trump\\xa0began Monday in Colorado with a group of voters tying to use the Civil War-era amendment to remove the former president from the 2024 ballot, citing his role in the January 6, 2021, insurrection.\\n   \\n      In a Denver courtroom, Trump’s lawyers clashed with the challengers, bashing their case as an “anti-democratic” end-around to derail Trump’s campaign without giving voters a say. The challengers argued that their litigation was an unfortunate but necessary step to ensure a “fair” 2024 election by keeping an ineligible candidate off the ballot.\\n   \\n      In addition to opening statements, a US Capitol Police officer who was on the front lines of the violent assault and Rep. Eric Swalwell, a Democrat who recounted the horrors of running from the pro-Trump mob, testified for the challengers.\\n   \\nThe case revolves around\\xa0Section 3 of the 14th\\xa0Amendment, which says that US officials who take an oath to uphold the Constitution are disqualified from future office if they “engaged in insurrection” or have “given aid or comfort” to insurrectionists. However, the Constitution is vague about how this ban should be enforced, and it has only been used twice since the\\xa019th\\xa0century.\\n   \\n      The trial is expected to last for one week and the judge has said she wants to\\xa0issue her decision by Thanksgiving, so there is time for appeals before the ballot-printing process begins in January for the GOP primary in Colorado on March 5, 2024.\\n   \\n      Here are the highlights from the first day of the historic trial:\\n   \\n      Lawyers for the Republican and independent voters who\\xa0filed the lawsuit\\xa0said in their opening statements that their goal is to “ensure Colorado has a fair election among eligible candidates.” Their case is backed by left-leaning watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington.\\n   \\n      “Our Constitution prevents people who betrayed their solemn oath, as Trump did here, from serving in office again,” said Eric Olson, an attorney for the challengers. “Colorado law gives these voters the right to make sure their votes will count by coming to this court and ensuring that only eligible candidates appear on our ballots. Trump engaged in insurrection, and therefore cannot appear on the ballot.”\\n   \\n      He added, “No person, not even the former president,\\xa0is above the law.”\\n   \\n      The\\xa0presentation also\\xa0featured footage from the deadly January 6 attack on the US Capitol and clips from the 2020 campaign in which Trump praised violence by his supporters, including his infamous comment to the right-wing Proud Boys group to “stand back and stand by.”\\n   \\n      Connecting Trump to the violence is a key part of the voters’ case, which faces an uphill climb.\\xa0Citing evidence from the\\xa0January 6 committee, Olson said Trump “summoned and organized” the mob and “knew” they were “armed and dangerous.”\\n   \\n      “Importantly, he helped them out by refusing to mobilize resources to stop the attack,” Olson said.\\n   \\n      Trump lawyer Scott Gessler,\\xa0a\\xa0former Colorado secretary of state, blasted the proceedings and said the case was “weak,” “anti-democratic”\\xa0and relied on “fringe” theories. He urged Colorado District Judge Sarah Wallace to not “interfere” with the 2024 election removing Trump from the ballot.\\n   \\n      “This\\xa0court should not interfere with that fundamental value – that rule of democracy. It’s the people who get to decide, and this lawsuit seeks to cancel that principle,” Gessler said.\\n   \\n      A key part of Trump’s defense is that the January 6 insurrection was not actually an insurrection, as envisioned by the 14th\\xa0Amendment, which was ratified in response to the full-blown rebellion that occurred during the Civil War.\\n   \\n      “When it comes to decide as to who should lead our nation, it’s the people of the United States of America that gets to make those decisions, not six voters in Colorado,” Gessler said, referring to the plaintiffs.\\n   \\n      Testifying for the anti-Trump challengers, Swalwell described the “haunting” experience of sheltering in the House chamber on January 6 while the right-wing mob surrounded the area.\\n   \\n      A California Democrat and\\xa0fiery Trump critic, Swalwell described how he realized in real time that Trump was endangering him and his colleagues by directing his supporters to go to the Capitol. The challengers used Swalwell’s testimony to try to connect Trump’s actions and words to the violent rampage by his supporters.\\n   \\n      “(Trump) aimed at the Capitol by saying that he was in solidarity and going to the Capitol with them – that we’re going to go to the Capitol – a lot of us in the cloakroom looked at each other in an\\xa0‘Oh God, what does this mean for us?’ kind of feeling,” Swalwell said.\\n   \\n      After the rioters violently breached the building, they nearly reached the House chamber. Swalwell described how the chaotic situation became extremely grave – with the Electoral College proceedings halted, police officers ordering members to put on gas masks, the House chaplain praying and a gunshot ringing out in the distance.\\n   \\n      He said he prepared for a fight and coordinated with Rep. Ruben Gallego, an Arizona Democrat and former Marine, who helped lawmakers put on gas masks, sometimes “using his teeth to rip them open.”\\n   \\n      “He also handed me a pen that was sitting on the table … and he said … ‘if any of them get near you just put this in their neck,’” Swalwell said.\\n   \\n      Outside of court,\\xa0Colorado Secretary of State Jena Griswold\\xa0said Monday on CNN that she hopes the trial will provide guidance on Trump’s eligibility for the ballot.\\n   \\n      “We’ve never had this type of\\xa0situation occur where a sitting\\xa0president incites the\\xa0insurrection and then has the\\xa0audacity to run again.\\xa0So there are real questions about whether\\xa0Section 3 of the 14th Amendment\\xa0disqualifies him.\\xa0I look forward to the\\xa0judge giving guidance on the\\xa0topic,” Griswold, a Democrat, said on “CNN News Central.”\\n   \\n      The defendants sued Trump and Griswold, who\\xa0hasn’t taken a position on whether the former president is disqualified and has said\\xa0she’ll do whatever the judge orders her to do.\\n   \\n      Griswold\\xa0said on CNN that\\xa0she believes Trump incited the January 6 insurrection, but added that it will be up to the judge to decide whether it means he\\xa0“engaged”\\xa0in the insurrection and is disqualified from office.\\n   \\n      She also brushed off the possibility that the lawsuit could be seen as a political abuse of the legal process\\xa0by\\xa0targeting the GOP front-runner.\\n   \\n      “It’s an\\xa0appropriate mechanism to file a\\xa0lawsuit. What is\\xa0inappropriate\\xa0is trying to steal\\xa0an election from the American\\xa0people, inciting an\\xa0insurrection, having a\\xa0scheme of fake electors, having conversations about stealing or seizing\\xa0voter equipment,” Griswold said. “Those things are unreasonable. A court case like we’re seeing play out here, I think is just fine.”\\n   \\n      The group challenging Trump extensively used his own words against him, playing clips from his infamous speech on election night 2020 when he falsely claimed victory, and from January 6 when he urged his supporters to “fight like hell” at the US Capitol.\\n   \\n      They also showed Trump’s social media posts from the tumultuous post-election period, including a December 2020 in which he told his supporters to come to Washington, DC, for the “wild” protest on January 6.\\n   \\n      Sean Grimsley, one of the lawyers for the anti-Trump challengers, told the judge that the point of presenting this material was “to show President Trump’s state of mind, and his communications to his supporters.”\\n   \\n      The challengers also cited many of the findings from the bipartisan House committee that investigated January 6, which recommended Trump’s disqualification under the 14th\\xa0Amendment.\\n   \\n      Trump’s lawyers said many of the videos and tweets lacked context, and they repeatedly raised objections to letting these materials into the court record.\\n   \\n      “I don’t even know where to begin on this one,” Gessler said while objecting to some of the committee’s report. “How do we cross-examine any of this evidence that contains speculation and opinion? This … characterizes or exemplifies the very worst aspects of the January 6 commission.”\\n   \\nThis story has been updated with additional information.\\n \\n  CNN’s\\xa0Avery Lotz and Andi Babineau contributed to this report.\\n',\n",

       " {'headline': '\\n      Chinese authorities crack down on stray dogs after a Rottweiler mauls a toddler. But some say they’ve gone too far\\n    ',\n",
       "  'contents': ' \\n      A shocking video of a Rottweiler mauling a 2-year-old girl in China has prompted a crackdown by local authorities on stray dogs that some argue has now gone too far.\\n   \\n      Authorities were initially praised for their swift response to the incident, but netizens soon began sharing accounts of stray canines in their neighborhood being roughly rounded up and, in some cases, put down.\\n   \\n      The new directive to clamp down on large, unleashed dogs is being cited as the latest example of a knee-jerk reaction by Chinese authorities that also highlights the country’s long-standing struggle with animal rights and welfare.\\n   \\n      “Just because a large dog bit a child, all of them are being hunted down by ruthless security guards and police,” one user wrote on Chinese social media Weibo under the hashtag “Will the biting of the girl bring stigma to a large dog?” viewed by almost 1 million users. \\n   \\n      “Such a one-size-fits-all approach makes me really sad,” she said.\\n   \\n      Video of the October 16 attack shows the girl stepping out of a residential compound with her mother in Chongzhou, in China’s southwestern province of Sichuan, and immediately being chased and bitten by a large black Rottweiler.\\n   \\n      The mother tries to shield her daughter from the dog, but then tries to pull her back as the animal drags the child around. A cleaner who comes to help with a broom also fails to drive the dog away.\\n   \\n      A man finally succeeds in chasing the Rottweiler away with a wooden stick. By that time, the mother is sitting on the ground, crying, with her daughter in her arms.\\n   \\n      The toddler was admitted to hospital, where she was treated for a ruptured kidney, fractured ribs and bite marks on various parts of her body, several Chinese state media outlets reported.\\n   \\n      Authorities caught the Rottweiler and detained its owner, according to state media.\\n   \\n      Since then, local authorities in a raft of provinces including Shandong, Jiangxi, Yunnan, Hunan, Anhui have stepped up law enforcement, some more heavy-handed than others. Stray dogs are the main targets, but pets who are unleashed can also be subject to control measures. \\n   \\n      Most local police said they would ramp up patrols to round up stray dogs and fine owners who fail to put their dogs on a leash. More robust approaches include police in Yanzhou in Shandong vowing to hunt down “mad dogs” and euthanize them.\\n   \\n      The country is home to 40 million stray dogs, according to the 2021 China Pet Industry white paper. In the past, strays have been blamed for rabies outbreaks and authorities have attempted to control their numbers with culls.\\n   \\n      In one case that triggered an outpouring of grief online, a small stray dog – known as Xiao Huang, or little yellow – was taken away in a net by security personnel at a university campus in Chongqing and beaten to death, according to state-affiliated media. \\n   \\n      Many netizens were perplexed by the decision to kill a tiny dog, whose image is being shared on Weibo with the hashtag “straydogxiaohuang,” with a call for greater rights for stray dogs. The university said the canine had entered the student dormitory, posing a threat to the safety, according to state-affiliated news outlet Beijing Time.\\n   \\n      In Shanghai, images of police officers descending on a local neighborhood and dragging away a German Shepherd also sparked fury online.\\n   \\n      Many netizens believe the dog was old and did not pose a danger to the community.  But Shanghai authorities said they were acting on complaints from neighbors about an aggressive dog and that it was “taken in and dealt with,” according to a post on their WeChat account.\\n   \\n      This is not the first time Chinese authorities have been accused of being heavy-handed with animals.\\n   \\n      During Covid, some pet owners complained that their dogs were beaten to death when they were taken away for quarantine, anecdotes that sparked uproar across the internet.\\n   \\n      A number of netizens praised the authorities for taking proactive steps, but most warned against the consequences of going overboard.\\n   \\n      Celebrities also joined the chorus of animal lovers to call for better understanding.\\n   \\n      Chinese actress and singer Cya Liu, who won Best Actress at the Hong Kong Film Awards last year, called for an end to the killing.\\n   \\n      “Not all stray dogs are bad just as not all men are good,” she wrote on Weibo, with the hashtag “voicing out for stray dogs.”\\n   \\n      Bo Ai Animal Protection Centre Of Guangyuan in Sichuan wrote on Tumblr-like Chinese social media Meipian that China should be using its development to instil a better sense of social responsibility and a respect for animals in people.\\n   \\n      “Beating and catching dogs at every turn. Let the world see what our great motherland is like,” it said.\\n  ',\n",

       "  'contents': ' \\n      Canada has banned Chinese super-app WeChat on official government devices citing cybersecurity risks, following similar action taken against short-form video app TikTok earlier this year.\\n   \\n      The latest ban, announced on Monday and effective the same day, was also imposed on applications from Kaspersky Lab, a Russian maker of antivirus programs.\\n   \\n      Canada’s\\xa0chief information officer had determined that “WeChat and [the] Kaspersky suite of applications present an unacceptable level of risk to privacy and security,” the Treasury Board of Canada, which oversees public administration, said in a statement.\\n   \\n      On a mobile device, the data collection methods of both applications provide “considerable access” to the device’s contents, according to the statement. It added there was no evidence that government information had been compromised.\\n   \\n      Users of Canadian government cellphones will have the apps removed and will be blocked from downloading them in the future.\\n   \\n      CNN has reached out to Tencent, the owner of Wechat, and Kaspersky Lab for comment.\\n   \\n      WeChat is one of the world’s most popular apps. It is sometimes described as Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat\\xa0and PayPal all rolled into one.\\n   \\n      More than 1 billion users, primarily in mainland China, rely on the social network to do virtually everything, from ordering groceries to booking a yoga class to paying bills, without leaving the app.\\n   \\n      In February, the Canadian government banned TikTok, owned by Beijing-based ByteDance, from government-issued mobile devices in light of cybersecurity concerns.\\n   \\n      US and allied officials have expressed concerns that TikTok or ByteDance could be asked by the Chinese government to hand over the personal information of TikTok users.\\n   \\n      A former employee of ByteDance, Yintao Yu, has outlined specific claims that the Chinese Communist Party had previously accessed the data of TikTok users on a broad scale for political purposes. The allegation, which TikTok disputes, was made in May as part of a wrongful termination case in California.\\n   \\n      Relative to TikTok, Wechat has been a less prominent target of global governments over the past year in part because it is much more popular among Chinese speakers.\\n   \\n      In August 2020, then-US President Donald Trump tried to ban Wechat along with TikTok by issuing executive orders. They were later blocked by an injunction. President Joe Biden eventually revoked the Trump-era executive orders.\\n  ',\n",

You can listen to an audio version of the newsletter by clicking the same link.\\n \\n      Markets soared on Monday, just one day after the S&P 500 index landed in correction territory, ending the prior week 10% off its July zenith.\\n   \\n      But Monday’s optimism could be short lived. Traders face a multitude of potentially scary market surprises lurking in the shadows this Halloween week.\\n   \\n      Wall Street is clearly spooked: The S&P 500 is still down by about 2.9% for October, and pacing toward its third negative month in a row. It would be the longest losing streak since the start of the pandemic in 2020.\\n   \\n      The Dow is also on pace to end the month 1.6% lower. The Nasdaq Composite is 2.7% lower.\\n   \\n      CNN’s Fear and Greed Index, which tracks seven indicators of market sentiment in the United States, remained in the “fear” zone despite Monday’s market rally.\\n   \\n      Here’s what’s causing the market fears:\\n   \\nHigh bond yields\\n \\n      Surging yields have contributed to one of the worst periods for bond market performance in history and pressured equity markets.\\n   \\n      10-year Treasury yields are flirting with 5% for the first time since 2007, before the global financial crisis.\\n   \\n      Although rates have retreated a bit from recent highs, it’s clear that we’re in the middle of a paradigm shift, said Rob Almeida at MFS Investment Management. It’s unlikely that yields will return to pre-pandemic lows, he said.\\n   \\n      For American consumers, an elevated 10-year Treasury yield means financial pain, because it serves as a benchmark rate for a variety of consumer borrowing. That means more costly car loans, credit card rates and even student debt. It also means more expensive mortgage rates.\\n   \\n      Like an evil witch, yields have mounted “a broom to the moon,” said Jason Pride, chief of investment strategy & research at Glenmede.\\n   \\n      Higher yields on Treasuries put pressure on equity markets. Additionally, he wrote, “elevated yields are economically restrictive for businesses, as returns on new projects and expansions must be sufficient to cover the increased cost of funding.”\\n   \\nThe Fed\\n \\n      The Federal Reserve will announce its next interest rate decision Wednesday, Nov 1.\\n   \\n      Inflation has begun to stabilize, with annual consumer price growth falling to 3.7% from the 9.1% high it hit last year, but the labor market has remained stubbornly resilient.\\n   \\n      The majority of investors don’t believe the Fed will raise rates this week, but until the labor market has cooled considerably more and inflation rates drop back to the Fed’s 2% target, the option of future rate hikes remains on the table, haunting investors.\\n   \\n      Mixed economic data has left the Fed in a holding pattern, said Erik Weisman, chief economist at MFS Investment Management, and so it’s unlikely investors will hear anything this week that leaves them satisfied.\\n   \\n      “While the market would be delighted to learn something new concerning the expected timing and scope of future rate cuts or the ‘end-game’ for quantitative tightening,” he said, “this meeting is unlikely to provide much illumination on these fronts.”\\n   \\nGeopolitical strife\\xa0\\n \\nThe Israel-Hamas war, which began in early October, initially rattled global financial markets, sending stocks tumbling, the Israeli shekel sliding and oil prices climbing.\\n   \\n      Although immediate worries appear to have subsided, investors remain on edge. A prolonged war could drive prices higher and hurt the global economy.\\n   \\n      “While geopolitics typically has a short-lived direct market impact, the indirect impacts via inflation and economic growth can be more persistent,” said Seema Shah, chief global strategist at Principal Asset Management.\\n   \\n      Continuing war between Russia and Ukraine and growing tensions between the US and China are also spurring fear among investors.\\n   \\n      Oil prices fell on Monday but analysts at LPL Research wrote in a note on the same day that “the current geopolitical landscape is as dangerous as it has been in decades, and the risk of a spike in oil prices has increased.”\\n   \\n      The note echoes the warnings issued by JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon during his company’s earnings call earlier this month. “Now may be the most dangerous time the world has seen in decades,” he said.\\n   \\nMixed tech earnings\\xa0\\n \\n      Investors will pore over Apple’s third-quarter earnings report on Thursday for any information about the outlook for Big Tech, especially after tech stocks have had a decidedly mixed bag of earnings so far this quarter.\\n   \\n      Amazon was a huge winner. The e-commerce giant reported revenue last week of $143.1 billion for the quarter ending in September, marking a 13% increase from the same period last year and beating analysts’ estimates.\\n   \\n      The company reported quarterly profits of $9.9 billion, also beating estimates.\\n   \\n      But others weren’t so lucky.\\n   \\n      Shares of Meta slid last week after\\xa0the Facebook parent company reported that advertising revenue had been soft this quarter. While Meta beat expectations and posted significant year-over-year quarterly revenue gains of 23%, Wall Street worried about its Reality Labs division, which lost $3.7 billion.\\n   \\n      Google-parent Alphabet reported last week that it fell short in its cloud business, causing shares of the company to drop precipitously. Alphabet notched its largest stock decline since March 2020 on the news.\\n   \\nEmployees at some of the\\xa0largest drugstore chains\\xa0in the United States staged a new series of\\xa0walkouts across the country\\xa0Monday to demand the companies fix what employees say are\\xa0harsh working conditions\\xa0that make it difficult for them to\\xa0safely fill prescriptions, and which could put the health of their customers at risk.\\n   \\n      Walgreens and CVS employees are mostly not unionized, which makes a largescale walkout difficult to execute. Staff and organizers in multiple states confirmed to CNN that the walkouts have begun and will take place through November 1, but it remains unclear how widespread the action is.\\n   \\n      Workers at Walgreens and CVS have\\xa0previously staged walkouts\\xa0in Arizona, Washington, Massachusetts and Oregon in September and early October. Those work actions closed a handful of pharmacies briefly, and slowed business at several others. At the time, Walgreens told CNN the impact has been “minimal.”\\n   \\n      Shane Jerominski, an independent pharmacist in Southern California who used to work for Walgreens and is one of the walkout’s organizers, told CNN on\\xa0Monday that organizers are already overwhelmed by calls about closed pharmacies.\\n   \\n      During prior walkouts, pharmacy staff feared retaliation from their bosses and corporate leadership, said Jerominski. But there was no reported reprisal from leadership, which, he says,\\xa0has emboldened more staff to participate.\\n   \\n      Jerominski told CNN that there have been at least 25 store closures.\\n   \\n      Fraser Engerman, a Walgreens spokesperson, told CNN that just two stores closed on Monday and no more than 12 pharmacists walked out across the entire country. He did not immediately clarify whether that included pharmacy staff.\\n   \\n      Jerominski said that many employees who may still be concerned about a company reprisal are calling out sick instead of walking out, and those absences wouldn’t be counted as official walkouts by Walgreens.\\n   \\n      He expects momentum to build over the next three days and culminate Wednesday with a planned demonstration outside Walgreens’ headquarters in the Chicago suburb of Deerfield.\\n   \\n      Jerominski also said that a\\xa0GoFundMe page, initially started to help unionization efforts among pharmacy staff, had raised more than $60,000 and was being used as an emergency relief fund for workers who needed financial help in order to participate in the walkout.\\n   \\nApple’s MacBook Pro lineup and colorful iMacs just got even faster.\\n \\n      At an event livestreamed on Monday night, the company introduced its next-generation family of custom-made processors — the M3, M3 Pro and M3 Pro Max — and along with it, a handful of new computers.\\n   \\n      The event’s tagline — “scary fast” — was an apparent nod to the unveiling of the next-generation silicon chip series, as well as the Halloween holiday Tuesday. In the beginning of the pre-recorded presentation, CEO Tim Cook appeared wearing all black within a dimly lit spot inside Apple’s Cupertino, California-based headquarters, standing in front of an apparent smoke machine.\\n   \\n      Although unveiling a new processor may not sound sexy, it will serve as the backbone to Apple’s latest products, enabling faster speeds and more capabilities than ever. For example, Apple said the M3 speeds are now up to 2.5x faster than on the M1 family of chips, and its core processing performance is up to 50% faster. The chips are built with 3 nanometer technology, which can support advanced graphics and artificial intelligence.\\n   \\n      “It will bring a whole new level of graphics to the Mac,” an Apple executive said during the event. “They are the most advanced chips ever built for a personal computer.”\\n  ',\n",

       " {'headline': '\\n      Sam Altman warns AI could kill us all. But he still wants the world to use it\\n    ',\n",
       "  'contents': ' \\n      Sam Altman thinks the technology underpinning his company’s most famous product could bring about the end of human civilization.\\n   \\n      In May, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman filed into a Senate subcommittee hearing room in Washington, DC, with an urgent plea to lawmakers: Create thoughtful regulations that embrace the powerful promise of artificial intelligence – while mitigating the risk that it overpowers humanity. It was a\\u202fdefining moment for him\\u202fand for the future of AI.\\n   \\n      With the launch of OpenAI’s ChatGPT late last year, Altman, 38, emerged overnight as the poster child for a new crop of AI tools that can generate images and texts in response to user prompts, a technology called generative AI. Not long after its release, ChatGPT became a household name almost synonymous with AI itself. CEOs used it to\\u202fdraft emails, people built websites with no prior coding experience, and it\\u202fpassed exams\\u202ffrom law and business schools. It has the potential to revolutionize nearly every industry, including education, finance, agriculture and healthcare, from surgeries to medicine vaccine development.\\n   \\n      But those\\u202fsame tools have raised concerns about everything from cheating in schools and displacing human workers – even an existential threat to humanity. The rise of AI, for example, has led economists to warn of a massive shift in the labor market. As many as\\u202f300 million full-time jobs\\u202faround the world could eventually be automated in some way by generative AI, according to Goldman Sachs estimates. Some\\u202f14 million positions\\u202fcould disappear in the next five years alone, according to an April report by the World Economic Forum.\\n   \\n      In his testimony before Congress, Altman said the potential for AI to be used to manipulate voters and target disinformation were among “my areas of greatest concern.”\\n   \\n      Two weeks after the hearing, Altman joined hundreds of top AI scientists, researchers and business leaders in signing a one-sentence letter stating: “Mitigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war.”\\n   \\n      The stark warning was widely covered in the press, with some suggesting it showed the need to take such apocalyptic scenarios more seriously. It also highlighted an important dynamic in Silicon Valley: Top executives at some of the biggest tech companies are simultaneously telling the public that AI has the potential to bring about human extinction while also racing to invest in and deploy this technology into products that reach billions of people.\\n   \\n      Although Altman, a longtime entrepreneur and Silicon Valley investor, largely stayed out of the spotlight in prior years, eyes have shifted to him in recent months as the poster child for the AI revolution. This has also exposed him to litigation,\\u202fregulatory scrutiny and both praise and condemnation around the world.\\n   \\n      That day in front of the Senate subcommittee, however, Altman described the technology’s current boom as a pivotal moment.\\n   \\n      “Is [AI] gonna be like the printing press that diffused knowledge, power, and learning widely across the landscape that empowered ordinary, everyday individuals that led to greater flourishing, that led above all two greater liberty?” he said. “Or is it gonna be more like the atom bomb – huge technological breakthrough, but the consequences (severe, terrible) continue to haunt us to this day?”\\n   \\n      Altman has long presented himself as someone who is mindful of the risks posed by AI, and he\\u202fhas pledged to move forward responsibly. He is one of several tech CEOs to\\u202fmeet with White House leaders, including Vice President Kamala Harris and President Joe Biden, to emphasize the importance of ethical and responsible AI development.\\n   \\n      Others want Altman and OpenAI to move more cautiously. Elon Musk, who helped found OpenAI before breaking from the group, and dozens of tech leaders, professors and researchers in\\u202furged\\u202fartificial intelligence labs like OpenAI to stop the training of the most powerful AI systems for at least six months, citing “profound risks to society and humanity.”\\u202f(At the same time, some experts questioned if those who signed the letter sought to maintain their competitive edge over other companies.)\\n   \\n      Altman said he agreed with parts of the letter, including that “the safety bar has got to increase,” but said a pause would not be an “optimal way” to address the challenges.\\n   \\n      Still, OpenAI has its foot placed firmly on the gas pedal. Most recently, OpenAI and iPhone designer Jony Ive have\\u202freportedly\\u202fbeen in talks to raise $1 billion from Japanese conglomerate SoftBank for an AI device to replace the smartphone.\\n   \\n      Those who know Altman have described him as someone who makes\\u202fprescient bets\\u202fand has even been called “a startup Yoda” or the “Kevin Bacon of Silicon Valley,” having worked with seemingly everyone in the industry. Aaron Levie, the CEO of enterprise cloud company Box and a longtime friend of Altman who came up with him in the startup world, told CNN that Altman is “introspective” and wants to debate ideas, get different points of view and endlessly encourages\\u202ffeedback on whatever he’s working on.\\n   \\n      “I’ve always found him to be incredibly self-critical on ideas and willing to take any kind of feedback on any topic that he’s been involved with over the years,” Levie said.\\n   \\n      But Bern Elliot, an analyst at Gartner Research, noted the famous cliché: There’s a risk to putting all your eggs in one basket, no matter how much trust you may place in it.\\n   \\n      “Many things can happen to one basket,” he added.\\n   \\n      When starting OpenAI, Altman told CNN in 2015 he wanted to steer the path of AI, rather than worrying about the potential harms and doing nothing. “I sleep better knowing I can have some influence now,” he said.\\n   \\n      Despite his leadership status, Altman says he remains concerned about the technology. “I prep for survival,” he said in\\u202fa 2016 profile\\u202fin the New Yorker, noting several possible disaster scenarios, including “A.I. that attacks us.”\\n   \\n      “I have guns, gold, potassium iodide, antibiotics, batteries, water, gas masks from the Israeli Defense Force, and a big patch of land in Big Sur I can fly to,” he said.\\n   \\n      Some AI industry experts say, however, that focusing attention on far-off apocalyptic scenarios may distract from the more immediate harms that a new generation of powerful AI tools can cause to people and communities. Rowan Curan, an analyst at market research firm Forrester, acknowledged the legitimate concerns around making sure training data, particularly for enormous models, has minimal bias – or has a bias that is understood and can be mitigated.\\n   \\n      “The idea of an ‘AI apocalypse’ as a realistic scenario that presents any kind of danger to humanity – particularly in the short and medium term, is just speculative techno-mythology,” he said. “The continued focus on this as one of the big risks that comes along with advancement of AI distracts from the very real challenges we have today to reduce current and future harms from data and models being applied unjustly by human actors.”\\n   \\n      In perhaps the biggest sweeping effort to date, President Biden unveiled an executive order earlier this week that will require developers of powerful AI systems to share results of their safety tests with the federal government before they are released to the public, if they pose national security, economic or health risks.\\n   \\n      Following the Senate hearing, Emily Bender, a professor at the University of Washington and director of its Computational Linguistics Laboratory, expressed\\u202fconcerns over what a future looks like with AI even if it’s heavily regulated. “If they honestly believe that this could be bringing about human extinction, then why not just stop?” she said.\\n   \\n      Margaret O’Mara, a tech historian and professor at the University of Washington, said good policymaking should be informed by multiple perspectives and interests, not just by one or few people, and shaped with the public interest in mind.\\n   \\n      “The challenge with AI is that only a very few people and firms really understand how it works and what the implications are of its use,” said O’Mara, noting similarities to the world of nuclear physics before and during the Manhattan Project’s development of the atomic bomb.\\n   \\n      Still, O’Mara said many people across the tech industry are rooting for Altman to be the force to revolutionize society with AI but make it safe.\\n   \\n      “This time is akin to what Gates and Jobs did for the personal computing moment of the early 1980s, and the software moment of the 1990,” she said. “There’s a real hope that we can have tech that makes things better, if the people who are making it are good people, smart and care about the right things. Sam embodies that for AI right now.”\\n   \\n      The world is counting on\\xa0Altman to act in the best interest of humanity with a technology by his own admission could be a weapon of mass destruction. Although he may be a smart and qualified leader, he’s still just that: one person.\\n  ',\n",

       " {'headline': '\\n      For some cardiac patients with stents, long-term aspirin treatments might be on the way out\\n    ',\n",
       "  'contents': ' \\n      For some high-risk cardiovascular patients with stents, the often-recommended practice of prolonged taking of aspirin might be ineffective, and in some cases, even harmful, a new study found.\\n   \\n      The report, published in the scientific journal Circulation, looked at more than 7,500 patients with acute coronary syndrome: a term that describes a variety of heart conditions — including heart attacks — caused by a sudden drop in blood flow to the heart.\\n   \\n      To treat the condition, each of the patients was undergoing a common procedure called percutaneous coronary intervention, in which doctors thread a small balloon into the body to open the blocked artery. They also insert a metallic mesh tube called a stent into the coronary artery, which props up the blood vessel and keeps blood flowing. To prevent blood clots from forming after putting in the stent, most doctors recommend taking a combination of an antiplatelet medication and aspirin for about a year.\\n   \\n      However, the study found that getting rid of aspirin from the regimen after three months was just as effective in avoiding clotting complications — while significantly reducing the risk of severe bleeding that aspirin can cause.\\n   \\n      “You often think to yourself, ‘What’s aspirin really doing being next to a very, very potent agent already? ’ ” said Dr. Roxana Mehran, the study’s principal investigator and a cardiologist at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. “What is it doing except to profoundly increase the bleeding risk?”\\n   \\n      Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death worldwide, responsible for nearly 18 million deaths each year, according to the World Health Organization.\\n   \\n      For years, medical professionals widely recommended regular aspirin to prevent heart problems, since aspirin can reduce blood clotting to prevent complications like heart attacks or strokes.\\n   \\n      However, the medication could also increase the risk of severe bleeding, particularly as people get older.\\n   \\n      As a result, in 2019, the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association shifted course and no longer recommended daily aspirin as a preventative for older adults who don’t have a high risk or existing heart disease. And in 2022, the United States Preventive Services Task Force recommended against a daily aspirin for people over 60.\\n   \\n      \\xa0For healthy, younger adults with an increased risk of heart attack or stroke, daily aspirin could have a modest benefit, though experts still recommend weighing it against the risk of bleeding.\\n   \\n      Still, many health care professionals still consider aspirin to be beneficial for many patients who have heart problems or have a stent. The new study’s results, however, might challenge that assumption.\\n   \\n      Using pooled patient data from two large clinical trials — one that Mehran helped conduct in the United States and a separate trial from collaborators in South Korea — the researchers looked at patients with acute coronary syndrome who were receiving ongoing therapy to prevent clotting after getting stents.\\n   \\n      Normally, patients take a combination of aspirin and a potent anti-clotting medication called ticagrelor for up to a year after getting the stent. However, the report found that patients who stopped taking aspirin after three months fared just as well as those on the aspirin-ticagrelor combination therapy: rates of death, heart attacks, and strokes were the same in both groups.\\n   \\n      Dropping aspirin also reduced the risk of severe bleeding by nearly 50% compared with patients on the combination therapy, said Mehran — without increasing the risk of cardiac complications.\\n   \\n      It’s a finding that experts believe could lead to a new standard of care for high-risk cardiac patients. Given the results of her clinical trial and a growing amount of evidence suggesting that long-term aspirin may not be beneficial for acute coronary syndrome, Mehran prescribes a treatment plan without long-term aspirin for her own patients.\\n   \\n      She also believes that aspirin can be removed from the regimen even earlier — potentially after a month. That shortened time frame, she added, is being investigated by several ongoing studies.\\n   \\n      “If we have good evidence that aspirin is not doing much of anything except to increase bleeding in that vulnerable period, why not withdraw aspirin after a certain amount of time?” Mehran said.\\n   \\n      However, experts agree that aspirin remains a beneficial medication for heart conditions.\\n   \\n      “The public should know that aspirin remains an important treatment for a heart attack, and in these studies, it was an essential therapy in the 3 months after receiving the stent,” Dr. Harlan Krumholz, a cardiologist and professor at the Yale School of Medicine, wrote in an email to CNN.\\n   \\n      For one, the results do not apply for patients who have other heart problems, such as atrial fibrillation, a condition that requires blood thinners to treat.\\n   \\n      “We are not saying that aspirin is terrible and should be stopped in all patients; that is not at all the message,” Mehran added.\\n   \\n      The report focused on a select group of high-risk patients recovering from acute coronary syndrome and a stent placement, and eliminating aspirin from their treatment plans is contingent on the patients taking ticagrelor twice a day for at least a year.\\n   \\n      Patients in the study also needed to make it through the first three months of combination therapy without any complications before aspirin was removed from their regimen.\\n   \\n      Krumholz believes that further research that looks to simplify medication plans could also improve patients’ health.\\n   \\n      “We need more studies like these where we are testing the value of withdrawing medications people are on — instead of just assuming that we need to continue them,” he wrote. “This study helps us understand how we can safely simplify the drug regimen for these patients, and by subtracting a drug, we can actually improve outcomes.”\\n  ',\n",

Lonely Planet says the Covid-19 lockdown has allowed the Czech capital to “hit the reset button”\\xa0 and to promote “slow tourism and attractions away from the city center.”\\n   \\n      The top sustainable travel destination for 2024 is Spain, because of the country’s efforts to expand renewable energy, to boost off-season travel and to bring tourism to emerging destinations, such as the port city of Valencia, thereby easing pressures on hot spots such as Barcelona.\\n   \\n      The “wild beauty” of South Africa also gets a nod, with Lonely Planet recommending visitors check out the country’s “impressive crop of ecolodges” committed to protecting Earth’s biodiversity. We also love Babanango, South Africa’s big new game park which is transforming the KwaZulu Natal region into a wildlife wonderland.\\n   \\n      The best-value category will be of particular interest to many in these wallet-pinching times. The underrated American Midwest is the top tip here: in cities such as Chicago, Milwaukee and Detroit, “you’ll find old warehouses transformed into art studios, new eco design hotels and many Michelin-starred restaurants,” says Lonely Planet.\\n   \\n      The publisher also recommends Algeria as an under-explored corner of Northern Africa. Pointing out that it’s a three-hour flight or less from much of Europe, Lonely Planet says visitors will find “well-preserved Roman sites and fine historic cities” and “an affordable, crowd-free experience.”\\n   \\n      When it comes to regional picks, the Western Balkans’ upcoming Trans Dinarica cycling route is a top choice by Lonely Planet. Opening next year, the 3,364-kilometer (2,090-mile) trail passes through Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Hercegovina, Montenegro, Albania, North Macedonia, Kosovo and Serbia, taking in mountain ranges and the Adriatic Sea along the way.\\n   \\n      Donegal, Ireland’s most northwestern county, has the country’s longest coastline and more than 100 beaches – and the chances are good that a visitor might get one all to themselves. Says Lonely Planet, “Here you’ll find the highest sea cliffs in Europe and miles of unspoilt coastal hiking trails.”\\n   \\nCountries\\n \\n      Mongolia\\n   \\n      India\\n   \\n      Morocco\\n   \\n      Chile\\n   \\n      Benin\\n   \\n      Mexico\\n   \\n      Uzbekistan\\n   \\n      Pakistan\\n   \\n      Croatia\\n   \\n      St. Lucia\\n   \\nRegions\\n \\n      Western Balkans’ Trans Dinarica Cycling Route\\n   \\n      Kangaroo Island, South Australia\\n   \\n      Donegal, Ireland\\n   \\n      País Vasco, Spain\\n   \\n      Southern Thailand\\n   \\n      Swahili Coast, Tanzania\\n   \\n      Montana, USA\\n   \\n      Saalfelden Leogang, Austria\\n   \\nCities\\n \\n      Nairobia, Kenya\\n   \\n      Paris, France\\n   \\n      Montreal, Canada\\n   \\n      Mostar, Bosnia and Herzegovina\\n   \\n      Philadelphia, Pennsylvania\\n   \\n      Manaus, Brazil\\n   \\n      Jakarta, Indonesia\\n   \\n      Prague, Czech Republic\\n   \\n      Izmir, Turkey\\n   \\n      Kansas City, Missouri\\n   \\nSustainable\\n \\n      Spain\\n   \\n      Patagonia, Argentina and Chile\\n   \\n      Greenland\\n   \\n      Wales’ trails\\n   \\n      The Portuguese Way / Caminho Português de Santiago\\n   \\n      Palau\\n   \\n      Hokkaido, Japan\\n   \\n      Ecuador\\n   \\n      Baltic Trails of Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania\\n   \\n      Eco-lodges of South Africa\\n   \\nValue\\n \\n      The Midwest, USA\\n   \\n      Poland\\n   \\n      Nicaragua\\n   \\n      Danube Limes, Bulgaria\\n   \\n      Normandy, France\\n   \\n      Egypt\\n   \\n      Ikaria, Greece\\n   \\n      Algeria\\n   \\n      Southern Lakes & Central Otago, New\\xa0 Zealand\\n   \\n      Night trains, Europe\\n  ',\n",

       "  'contents': ' \\n      Think of “ghost towns” and images of dusty, lost-to-time towns, like those in America’s Wild West, may come to mind.\\n   \\n      Indeed, in the second half of the 19th century, a slew of boomtown-gone-bust mining towns were deserted by residents as natural resources and economic viability dried up. Over time, some of these relics have found new life as fun and kitschy tourist attractions.\\n   \\n      And while iterations of such abandoned settlements are found on every continent, with varying manmade and natural causes to blame, a new era of ghost towns is now emerging that, while eerie, feels far off from good touristic fun.\\n   \\n      Climate change and ensuing environmental disasters – marked by an increasing frequency and intensity of destructive floods, droughts, storms, wildfires and extreme temperatures – are now fueling what experts say are just the first waves of places abandoned due to climate displacement.\\n   \\n      “We are going to see a movement – it’s already happening – where people are moving away from these areas that are most impacted by storms, by rising sea levels and floods, but also by constant fire, smoke inhalation – all of that,” says Gaia Vince, author of “Nomad Century: How Climate Migration Will Reshape Our World.”\\n   \\n      She cites recent examples like wildfires in Hawaii, California and Australia, and floods in Bangladesh, as some of the latest triggers for population displacements.\\n   \\n      “How many people are going to return to Lahaina in Hawaii after the fires there?” she questions. “I don’t think it’ll be 100% of the population that left. Some people will not be able to.”\\n   \\n      Abandoning a settlement is typically a last-resort scenario, made only once residents have exhausted all other options, say experts.\\n   \\n      In some instances, resettlements have been aided or forced in “managed retreats” or “planned relocations,” in which financial and logistical support is provided by government agencies. Jack DeWaard, scientific director at international nongovernmental organization the Population Council, and an expert on climate and environmental migration and displacement, notes that this involves government entities “working collectively with communities to relocate them entirely.”\\n   \\n      For the displaced, “the costs of migration, economically and psychologically, are substantial,” he says.\\n   \\n      “They’re forced to leave their traditions, their network of family and friends, their ancestors’ graves, their language, all of that, because it’s become unlivable. That is very traumatic, it’s very difficult,” adds Vince.\\n   \\n      More than 20 million people are forced to leave their homes due to extreme weather events each year, according to the United Nations. Researchers have projected that by the end of the century, somewhere in the range of 3 to 6 billion people will be “left outside the ‘human climate niche’” that best supports life.\\n   \\n      “It doesn’t mean that 3 to 6 billion people will have to move, but it does mean a lot of people have to move,” Vince notes. This, she says, will disproportionality affect communities of color and/or those who are already facing poverty.\\n   \\n      “Typically, migration and displacement, these are processes that are rooted in inequality,” explains DeWaard, who adds that the climate crisis is only “going to exacerbate the existing inequalities of today.”\\n   \\n      Through the lens of tourism, many areas that have been historically reliant on tourism economies\\xa0will also be vulnerable to abandonment says Vince. She cites examples like Alpine ski resorts, where snowfall is no longer conducive to skiing, or traditional holiday spots like Spain and the Mediterranean that have been experiencing deadly heatwaves and wildfires.\\n   \\n      “Tourists are going to choose other places,” she says. “They don’t want to sit in a heatwave, with having to be evacuated because of forest fires.”\\n   \\n      But there is also a niche segment of so-called “dark tourism” that could arise around such climate change-born ghost towns.\\n   \\n      “There is an inherent fascination with ruination, where ruins of the past often tell a story of our misdeeds and misfortunes,” explains Philip Stone of the University of Central Lancashire, where he runs the Institute for Dark Tourism Research. “Climate change will undoubtedly cause death of landscapes where we shall mourn our environmental decline.”\\n   \\n      While the pursuit of dark tourism, which the Institute defines as “tourist sites of death, disaster, or the seemingly macabre,” can raise ethical questions, Stone ventures to say that such touristic curiosity can actually be beneficial.\\n   \\n      “The visual impact of climate change-induced landscapes serves as a warning of our industrialization,” he says. “Visiting such places now can shine a critical light on the effects of climate change and, in so doing, offer educational experiences to the contemporary visitor.”\\n   \\n      Here are five global ghost towns that have been created as climate change reshapes the world – the likely harbingers of many more to come. (Note that in some of these destinations, some holdout townsfolk still remain.)\\n   \\n      The South Pacific island nation of Fiji is particularly vulnerable to the climate change effects of rising sea levels and intensifying cyclones.\\n   \\n      Dozens of coastal communities in Fiji have been earmarked for planned relocations to higher ground by the Fijian government, as their underwater fates loom ever nearer.\\n   \\n      The small seaside village of Vunidogoloa, on Vanua Levu, the country’s second-biggest island, was the first of the bunch to be relocated, to a lush inland hillside, in 2014.\\n   \\n      Today, remnants of the original dilapidated village, now overrun with vegetation, are all that remain on the old site where some 150 people once lived.\\n   \\n      Communities along coastal Louisiana have been particularly devastated by climate change’s sea level rise, coastal erosion and battering storms and hurricanes.\\n   \\nIsle de Jean Charles, an island in the Gulf of Mexico about 80 miles (129 kilometers) south of New Orleans, once spanned 22,000 acres. But today, only 320 acres of the sinking island remain.\\n   \\n      The local community, where residents claimed Native American ancestry, was awarded a government grant, affording them funding to develop a newly established settlement dubbed “The New Isle,” set about 40 miles north of the island, on higher ground.\\n   \\n      As of October 2023, all but four of Isle de Jean Charles’s original families have relocated there.\\n   \\n      Among the most climate change-vulnerable countries in Europe, Moldova faces ongoing climate risks like heatwaves, storms, droughts, and, most especially, floods, having recorded three major flooding events in the last 20 years.\\n   \\n      The impacts of such flooding in the heavily agricultural nation have led to widespread destruction and expense, with some villages deemed damaged beyond repair. One such settlement was Cotul Morii, a village on the banks of the Prut River that was submerged by catastrophic flooding in 2010.\\n   \\n      Rather than rebuild, the government mandated that a new Cotul Morii village be reconstructed about nine miles away.\\n   \\n      Once the world’s highest ski resort, the 17,388-foot-high lodge on Mount Chacaltaya opened in the 1930s as a popular – and only – ski resort in Bolivia’s Andes.\\n   \\n      For decades, the mountaintop resort, just north of La Paz, welcomed skiers and sledders in the winter months to crisscross its snowy pistes, until shuttering in 2009.\\n   \\n      That was the same year the mountain’s 18,000-year-old Chacaltaya glacier completely melted away due to climate change – with much of the snow disappearing along with it.\\n   \\n      Today, the one-time resort, with its abandoned café, bar, and ski lifts, stands in testimony to what was.\\n   \\n      Climate change has been linked to more volatile cycles of droughts and flooding along the Mississippi River, North America’s longest river.\\n   \\n      When the Mississippi’s Great Flood of 1993 inundated the small Illinois town of Valmeyer, damaging the majority of its buildings, town residents – with government funding to back them – decided to reconstruct the 900-person town on a neighboring bluff.\\n   \\n      While the flood event itself perhaps predates climate change, 30 years later, the new town of Valmeyer is considered to be a textbook case for how town relocations for climate resilience might be successfully conducted today.\\n   \\n      Today, the new Valmeyer is thriving; the old town, set within a natural floodplain, is primarily used for farming and recreation.\\n  ',\n",

       " {'headline': '\\n      Why an artist turned 6,000 unwanted copies of ‘The Da Vinci Code’ into ‘Nineteen Eighty-Four’\\n    ',\n",
       "  'contents': ' \\n  Editor’s Note: This article was originally published by\\xa0The Art Newspaper, an editorial partner of CNN Style.\\n \\n(CNN) — It all began in 2017, when a charity-owned thrift store\\xa0in Swansea, Wales, put a notice in its window imploring people to stop donating copies of Dan Brown’s “The Da Vinci Code.” On average, the shop was receiving one copy per day. The plea went viral, catching the eye of the British artist David Shrigley, who decided to try and collect as many copies as he could, amassing 6,000 books over six years.\\n   \\n      The brainwave to pulp them and turn them into copies of George Orwell’s “Nineteen Eighty-Four” came when Shrigley re-read the dystopian novel during the pandemic — 2020 marked 70 years since Orwell died, meaning the book was out of copyright and could be published by anyone.\\n   \\n      Over the weekend, copies of Shrigley’s limited-edition version of Orwell’s classic went on show in the thrift store that inspired the project, which he dubbed “Pulped Fiction.” Displayed in rows from ceiling to floor, the black-and-white covers have a dizzying effect. “It’s like you’ve entered a totalitarian regime where there is no choice. This is the book, and you’re going to read it,” Shrigley quipped in an interview.\\n   \\n      The artist first read “Nineteen Eighty-Four” when he was an art student in the 1980s. On reading it again, he said he realized “that it was still a really resonant book, (and) that it seemed even more relevant than when I first read it when you were invited to see it as a parable of Soviet or Chinese communism.”\\n   \\n      In today’s climate, Shrigley sees the “subversion of language” in the book as more revealing of contemporary society, particularly when it comes to the words employed around war. “Ethnic cleansing is now the name for what used to be called genocide,” he said. “Russia’s invasion of Ukraine wasn’t a conflict; it was war. Conversely, it’s not a culture war. It wasn’t a war between Betamax and VHS, and it wasn’t a war between Blur and Oasis. Those were arguments.”\\n   \\n      Shrigley cited how the writer Margaret Atwood, when her 1985 novel “The Handmaid’s Tale” was made into a TV series in 2017, said there wasn’t anything in the book that hadn’t already happened in the United States. “From the removal of women’s rights to the removal of civil rights from the general population. These weren’t invented phenomena. They were things that were actually happening at the time,” Shrigley said.\\n   \\n      The artist thinks the same could be said of “Nineteen Eighty-Four.” “War is presented as peace. Enemies are invented for us. We’re invited to think that black is white, and white is black. Day is night, and night is day,” he said. “This is a book that people should read. It’s still really relevant.”\\n   \\n      Though his project is not intended as a piece of library criticism, Shrigley describes “The Da Vinci Code” as “a holiday book about a fairly benign conspiracy — unless you happen to be a Christian and are quite offended by it, which is fair enough.”\\n   \\n      Does he think Brown would approve of his project? “He’s a difficult man to get hold of,” Shrigley said. “We’ve heard from his publicist, and there’s been nothing negative. There’s been no cease-and-desist.” (Brown’s representatives did not respond to CNN’s request for comment.)\\n   \\n      A collaborative effort between Shrigley, his studio team and others, including the graphic designer Fraser Muggeridge, “Pulped Fiction” is arguably Shrigley’s most conceptual work to date. (In a bizarre twist, Muggeridge’s grandfather, the journalist and broadcaster Malcolm Muggeridge, proofread the original novel for Orwell.)\\n   \\n      Costing “well into six figures,” the project has been self-funded, and Shrigley said he may not make his money back — not that he cares. In Swansea, the newly printed books are selling for £495 ($600) for the first 250 customers, while the remaining thousand will be sold for £795 ($963) on Shrigley’s website.\\n   \\n      “I’m in a position in my life now where I can actually afford to take risks and do things that I want to do, even though they don’t necessarily really fit in my canon of work,” Shrigley said. “The really interesting thing about a work like this is that the conversation informs the work. It’s the conversations that you have which further its progress.”\\n   \\nRead more stories from\\xa0The Art Newspaper\\xa0here.\\n',\n",

       "  'contents': ' \\n  Editor’s Note: This article was originally published by\\xa0The Art Newspaper, an editorial partner of CNN Style.\\n \\n(CNN) — It all began in 2017, when a charity-owned thrift store\\xa0in Swansea, Wales, put a notice in its window imploring people to stop donating copies of Dan Brown’s “The Da Vinci Code.” On average, the shop was receiving one copy per day. The plea went viral, catching the eye of the British artist David Shrigley, who decided to try and collect as many copies as he could, amassing 6,000 books over six years.\\n   \\n      The brainwave to pulp them and turn them into copies of George Orwell’s “Nineteen Eighty-Four” came when Shrigley re-read the dystopian novel during the pandemic — 2020 marked 70 years since Orwell died, meaning the book was out of copyright and could be published by anyone.\\n   \\n      Over the weekend, copies of Shrigley’s limited-edition version of Orwell’s classic went on show in the thrift store that inspired the project, which he dubbed “Pulped Fiction.” Displayed in rows from ceiling to floor, the black-and-white covers have a dizzying effect. “It’s like you’ve entered a totalitarian regime where there is no choice. This is the book, and you’re going to read it,” Shrigley quipped in an interview.\\n   \\n      The artist first read “Nineteen Eighty-Four” when he was an art student in the 1980s. On reading it again, he said he realized “that it was still a really resonant book, (and) that it seemed even more relevant than when I first read it when you were invited to see it as a parable of Soviet or Chinese communism.”\\n   \\n      In today’s climate, Shrigley sees the “subversion of language” in the book as more revealing of contemporary society, particularly when it comes to the words employed around war. “Ethnic cleansing is now the name for what used to be called genocide,” he said. “Russia’s invasion of Ukraine wasn’t a conflict; it was war. Conversely, it’s not a culture war. It wasn’t a war between Betamax and VHS, and it wasn’t a war between Blur and Oasis. Those were arguments.”\\n   \\n      Shrigley cited how the writer Margaret Atwood, when her 1985 novel “The Handmaid’s Tale” was made into a TV series in 2017, said there wasn’t anything in the book that hadn’t already happened in the United States. “From the removal of women’s rights to the removal of civil rights from the general population. These weren’t invented phenomena. They were things that were actually happening at the time,” Shrigley said.\\n   \\n      The artist thinks the same could be said of “Nineteen Eighty-Four.” “War is presented as peace. Enemies are invented for us. We’re invited to think that black is white, and white is black. Day is night, and night is day,” he said. “This is a book that people should read. It’s still really relevant.”\\n   \\n      Though his project is not intended as a piece of library criticism, Shrigley describes “The Da Vinci Code” as “a holiday book about a fairly benign conspiracy — unless you happen to be a Christian and are quite offended by it, which is fair enough.”\\n   \\n      Does he think Brown would approve of his project? “He’s a difficult man to get hold of,” Shrigley said. “We’ve heard from his publicist, and there’s been nothing negative. There’s been no cease-and-desist.” (Brown’s representatives did not respond to CNN’s request for comment.)\\n   \\n      A collaborative effort between Shrigley, his studio team and others, including the graphic designer Fraser Muggeridge, “Pulped Fiction” is arguably Shrigley’s most conceptual work to date. (In a bizarre twist, Muggeridge’s grandfather, the journalist and broadcaster Malcolm Muggeridge, proofread the original novel for Orwell.)\\n   \\n      Costing “well into six figures,” the project has been self-funded, and Shrigley said he may not make his money back — not that he cares. In Swansea, the newly printed books are selling for £495 ($600) for the first 250 customers, while the remaining thousand will be sold for £795 ($963) on Shrigley’s website.\\n   \\n      “I’m in a position in my life now where I can actually afford to take risks and do things that I want to do, even though they don’t necessarily really fit in my canon of work,” Shrigley said. “The really interesting thing about a work like this is that the conversation informs the work. It’s the conversations that you have which further its progress.”\\n   \\nRead more stories from\\xa0The Art Newspaper\\xa0here.\\n',\n",

       "  'contents': ' \\n      Turks on Sunday marked 100 years since the birth of the modern republic, with vibrant fireworks and a drone show over the Bosphorus strait lighting up the Istanbul skyline. During the day, naval ships sailed the famous waterway in a show of military might but also a signal of how far the republic has come since it emerged from the ashes of the Ottoman empire.\\n   \\n      Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan watched the show from the Vahdettin Pavillion, the residence of the last Ottoman sultan. For Erdogan, 2023 has represented both a goal and a promise – that under his leadership the country would see unparalleled progress.\\n   \\n      The celebrations were also a recognition of the last 100 years as Erdogan ushered in another century forged more in his own image than that of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the larger-than-life founding father of the republic.\\n   \\n      Today’s Turkey, however, is starkly different from the secular, Westernized state envisioned by Ataturk 100 years ago.\\n   \\n      For Erdogan’s opponents, the centennial is a tribute to the enduring nature of the original republic. Despite what they see as the president’s relentless attacks on Ataturk’s legacy, for them, the republican experiment is still alive.\\n   \\n      The republic and what it stands for 100 years after its declaration is perhaps one of the defining questions in modern Turkey’s deeply polarized society. In the lead-up to the celebrations, Erdogan’s critics accused him of trying to erase Ataturk’s memory. Meanwhile, Erdogan has presented himself as the flagbearer of Ataturk’s vision.\\n   \\n      Forged from the ruins of the Ottoman Empire, the republic was created after Ataturk defended the region against looming threats of invasion from Europe and Russia. With Istanbul under occupation after the Ottoman sultan capitulated to the Allied powers in World War I, Ataturk set out for the Turkish heartland of Anatolia to carve out a new homeland. He established a capital in Ankara.\\n   \\n      The Turkish republic as imagined by Ataturk was firmly rooted in the West and a quick succession of reforms sought to modernize a population decimated by war. The fez, a traditional Ottoman hat for men, was outlawed, and the Islamic veil discouraged, seen as a backward relic of the past. The written language was switched to the Latin alphabet from the Arabic script. Women were given the right to vote, years before most European nations. The Hagia Sofia, an Istanbul monument that was once a symbol of Byzantine Christian rule and that was turned by the Ottomans into a mosque, was converted to a museum as a symbol of co-existence.\\n   \\n      A hundred years later, the country under Erdogan has taken a different path, embracing its conservative roots and finding itself new relevance in the world of nations.\\n   \\n      The Islamic headscarf has made a very public comeback in the state that was once so secular that it banned the veil in public sector institutions, as well as universities, parliament and the military. The president’s wife and daughters now publicly wear a headscarf and all such restrictions have now been lifted. Three years ago, the Hagia Sofia was turned back into a Muslim house of worship. A ruling by Erdogan to turn it into a mosque sits at the monument’s entrance alongside Ataturk’s own decree to turn it into a museum.\\n   \\n      Last spring, Erdogan’s surprising victory in the presidential elections extended his rule into a third decade. It cemented his status as the country’s longest-serving leader and proved to critics that despite deep divisions, his vision for Turkey resonates with millions.\\n   \\n      That vision however has also alienated a significant proportion of the country. And in the midst of a pinching economic crisis and brain drain of its secular class, many are asking just who the Turkish republic belongs to, and how it has come so far from its founder’s vision.\\n   \\n      The role of religion\\n   \\n      For a country whose population is overwhelmingly Muslim, Turkey’s most defining tension has perhaps always been the role of religion in the state and in the public space.\\n   \\n      After the military forced out the government in 1997, Islamists and pious Muslims were alienated and persecuted, and a ban on wearing the headscarf in universities and public offices was introduced. Overt displays of religiosity by politicians weren’t tolerated, and Erdogan himself once landed in jail for reciting a religious poem as mayor of Istanbul in 1999.\\n   \\n      Erdogan’s current appeal can be seen in how much of Turkey’s pious see him as giving a voice to the previously voiceless. Across the country, his face is the background image on many young men’s phones.\\n   \\n      But religion isn’t the whole story; part of his following also comes from his humble origins.\\n   \\n      From the rough and tumble neighborhood of Kasimpasa in Istanbul, “he is an everyman,” worlds away from the previous leaders who “were shaped by the state’s ideology,” Soli Ozel a professor of International Relations at Kadir Has University in Istanbul, told CNN.\\n   \\n      After February’s devastating earthquakes, many observers were left wondering why the affected regions in central and southern Turkey, presented with evidence of government negligence, continued to support Erdogan and vote for him.\\n   \\n      People often express such justification through religion, Murat Somer, a professor of political science at Ozyegin University in Istanbul, told CNN. And, during times of war or disaster, “we know that people look to a strong leader.” And unless people see an alternative, strong choice, “they remain with the one they have,” Somer added.\\n   \\n      The opposition coalition in May’s election was led by the Republican People’s Party (CHP), a reiteration of the political party Ataturk founded. The top banner on its website has a quote from him: “I have two major accomplishments. One is the republic of Turkey, and the other is the Republican People’s Party.”\\n   \\n      Erdogan, according to Somer, continually presents himself as the “real Ataturk.” However, this comparison does not make sense to Ozel as Ataturk was “an unabashedly Western, secular, non-religious man.”\\n   \\n      The comparison does not just shine a light on the deep reverence Turks continue to hold for their republic’s founding father, however, it also points to a striking similarity between Turkey’s two strongmen.\\n   \\n      “He did rule in a way that legitimatized one-man rule,” Ayse Zarakol, a professor of international relations at the University of Cambridge, said of Ataturk. She notes how growing up in Turkey, “there was a message that the country needs a single man savior.”\\n   \\n      Yet Ataturk envisioned a different type of rule for his country.\\n   \\n      After the era of Westernization, the country moved to a multi-party democracy in 1938. But the Republican People’s Party, led by Ataturk’s long-time ally and close friend Ismet Inonu, lost the 1950 elections. Power transferred peacefully and democratically. Ataturk “wanted to lay the foundations of democracy,” Somer said.\\n   \\n      In 2017, Turkey held a referendum scrapping its decades-old parliamentary system for a new presidential one. It passed, centralizing the state’s control, and doing away with many of the previous checks that once existed on executive power.\\n   \\n      Somer suggested this as one reason the country looks so starkly different to 100 years ago. “After the First World War, (Turkish) society was much more split. It had just been defeated. Today, Turkey is much more prosperous, but this polarization stems from divisions created within,” he said. “I’m not sure whether the current government is really embraced by the majority of Turkish society.”\\n   \\n      Zarakol hesitated in suggesting that Turkish society has undergone a collective shift. “It has always had its conservative parts,” she told CNN. “The only difference is with the state’s control of the media, it is now more visible.” Just as it was with “the secularists in the 1970s.”\\n   \\n      Ozel suggests that part of that visibility stems from the country’s growing middle class. As “the conservative capitalists grew,” he told CNN, and migrated from the countryside to the cities Erdogan reflected those changing demographics.\\n   \\n      Yet, Westernization no longer holds the same appeal today as it did last century, Ozel said, since back then “there was no other model.” The world is no longer as “centred around Europe” as it used to be and with such a shift, “peripheral powers” have become much more important.\\n   \\n      What Ataturk may have been most proud of in today’s Turkey, however, is its growing influence on the world stage, analysts say. It is a legacy Erdogan is continuing to push, even if his brand of nationalism is very different.\\n   \\n      The country is a crucial member of NATO and it has been instrumental in leading diplomatic efforts between Russia and Ukraine. Turkey’s strategic location means it controls access to the Black Sea and it continues to serve as a gateway between the East and West, to trade via Central Asia, and to  conflicts in the Middle East.\\n   \\n      In 1926, after an assassination plot against him was discovered, Ataturk told his new nation: “One day my mortal body will turn to dust, but the Turkish republic will stand forever.”\\n  ',\n",

       " {'headline': '\\n      Playing dead: The Illinois funeral home with a mini-golf course underneath\\n    ',\n",
       "  'contents': ' \\n      People love miniature golf. Every year, millions across the globe putt their way around an endless array of obstacles in the pursuit of bragging rights.\\n   \\n      Few players, however, would describe it as a sport to die for. Yet at one unique venue in Illinois, death is par for the course.\\n   \\n      Welcome to Ahlgrim Acres, a macabre mini-golf experience buried underneath a funeral home.\\n   \\n      In 1964, Roger Ahlgrim strolled into Ahlgrim Family Funeral Services’ newly constructed building, located in the small, leafy village of Palatine, a suburb of Chicago. He was the grandson of Arthur Ahlgrim, who had founded the family firm in 1892.\\n   \\n      As he explored the new site, he discovered a vast basement. Some 20 feet below ground, with no windows, it could serve little purpose for the funeral business, but Ahlgrim soon found a use for the room.\\n   \\n      Over the following years, Ahlgrim and his sole employee mapped out and built a fully fledged nine-hole course. Designed to serve his children and the local neighborhood, within a decade it had become part of “the community room,” which included a full-size shuffleboard court, a ping pong table, a bumper pool table, and a foosball table hand-built when Ahlgrim was a teenager.\\n   \\n      Today, Jonathan Gwizdala, a fifth-generation Ahlgrim, is among the funeral directors that continue the legacy of his grandfather by overseeing the course.\\n   \\n      “He had a love for (miniature golf), just the fun of it,” Gwizdala told CNN.\\n   \\n      “When he opened the funeral home here … he had the space. The whole basement was down there, and you’re not going to hold a funeral in the basement.\\n   \\n      “If it’s bad weather there’s something a lot of the neighborhood kids know and can come on over.”\\n   \\n      The community room, including Ahlgrim Acres, is strictly closed during funeral services.\\n   \\n      The course, which is free of charge to play and has continuously developed over its 59-year history, leans into its unique setting. Macabre-themed and eerily lit in the absence of natural light, the ghoulish features begin from the outset.\\n   \\n      Nestled in a sand trap of the opening hole is Roger Ahlgrim’s very own sculpting skull from mortuary school, on which he learned how to form facial features.\\n   \\n      As an embalmer himself, it occupies one of Gwizdala’s best-loved holes.

       " {'headline': '\\n      Playing dead: The Illinois funeral home with a mini-golf course underneath\\n    ',\n",
       "  'contents': ' \\n      People love miniature golf. Every year, millions across the globe putt their way around an endless array of obstacles in the pursuit of bragging rights.\\n   \\n      Few players, however, would describe it as a sport to die for. Yet at one unique venue in Illinois, death is par for the course.\\n   \\n      Welcome to Ahlgrim Acres, a macabre mini-golf experience buried underneath a funeral home.\\n   \\n      In 1964, Roger Ahlgrim strolled into Ahlgrim Family Funeral Services’ newly constructed building, located in the small, leafy village of Palatine, a suburb of Chicago. He was the grandson of Arthur Ahlgrim, who had founded the family firm in 1892.\\n   \\n      As he explored the new site, he discovered a vast basement. Some 20 feet below ground, with no windows, it could serve little purpose for the funeral business, but Ahlgrim soon found a use for the room.\\n   \\n      Over the following years, Ahlgrim and his sole employee mapped out and built a fully fledged nine-hole course. Designed to serve his children and the local neighborhood, within a decade it had become part of “the community room,” which included a full-size shuffleboard court, a ping pong table, a bumper pool table, and a foosball table hand-built when Ahlgrim was a teenager.\\n   \\n      Today, Jonathan Gwizdala, a fifth-generation Ahlgrim, is among the funeral directors that continue the legacy of his grandfather by overseeing the course.\\n   \\n      “He had a love for (miniature golf), just the fun of it,” Gwizdala told CNN.\\n   \\n      “When he opened the funeral home here … he had the space. The whole basement was down there, and you’re not going to hold a funeral in the basement.\\n   \\n      “If it’s bad weather there’s something a lot of the neighborhood kids know and can come on over.”\\n   \\n      The community room, including Ahlgrim Acres, is strictly closed during funeral services.\\n   \\n      The course, which is free of charge to play and has continuously developed over its 59-year history, leans into its unique setting. Macabre-themed and eerily lit in the absence of natural light, the ghoulish features begin from the outset.\\n   \\n      Nestled in a sand trap of the opening hole is Roger Ahlgrim’s very own sculpting skull from mortuary school, on which he learned how to form facial features.\\n   \\n      As an embalmer himself, it occupies one of Gwizdala’s best-loved holes. His other favorite – trumping the ones with a moving guillotine, a life-sized grim reaper-like figure, and even a water trap – features Ahlgrim’s very own miniature mausoleum.\\n   \\n      Engraved on the tiny gravestones that players must avoid, are various names marked with their respective dates of death. Nothing out of the ordinary there, until you discover they are the names of Ahlgrim Family Funeral Services’ still-very-much-alive funeral directors.\\n   \\n      According to Gwizdala’s headstone, he has until 2050 before he shuffles off the mortal coil, a year chosen by his grandfather.\\n   \\n      “I put it out of my head a little bit, but we’ll see what happens,” said Gwizdala, laughing. “I don’t know if it’s funny or maybe a little macabre, but we like to incorporate the personal touches.”\\n   \\n      Host to thousands of rounds each year, Ahlgrim Acres has become woven into the fabric of the neighborhood.\\n   \\n      The décor of the community room is a love letter to the village’s history and culture.

       "  'contents': ' \\n      When tragedy takes the world stage, it can quickly become part of every conversation.\\n   \\n      But as much as it may feel imperative to stay fully engaged in the tragic updates and charged conversations about Israel and Gaza, doing so without boundaries may lead to compassion fatigue, said Dr. Rebecca Sachs, a clinical psychologist based in New York City.\\n   \\n      Compassion fatigue can also be thought of as secondary trauma, which means that you are traumatized even though you may not be the one undergoing the event, said Dr. Charles Figley, Kurzweg Distinguished Chair in Disaster Mental Health at Tulane University in New Orleans.\\n   \\n      The term was created to capture the experience of people in caretaking roles or professions — such as therapists, firefighters, police officers, emergency room health care professionals and family members caring for someone with a chronic condition, Figley said.\\n   \\n      But those who are watching traumatic things unfold in communities they are connected to as well as those they empathize with from afar may also feel the impact of compassion fatigue, Sachs said.\\n   \\n      That can lead to exhaustion, irritability and difficulty continuing to engage with their empathy if not attended to, Sachs said.\\n   \\n      To be the best you can be for yourself, your loved ones and the issues you support, it is important to check in with yourself and prevent compassion fatigue, Figley said.\\n   \\n      An important part of finding that balance of caring for yourself and others is knowing when to put difficult topics away, Figley said.\\n   \\n      “Everyone that I’ve talked with, they don’t have any problems with being ‘on,’” he said. “It’s being off that they have a problem with.”\\n   \\n      Turning off doesn’t mean you have to stop engaging in issues you care about, however, Sachs said.\\n   \\n      “I wouldn’t say it needs to be black and white,” she said. “It’s figuring out what is the level of engagement that can still lay a foundation for you to do valued actions to do something meaningful.\\n   \\n      “But also, what is the level of engagement at this moment in time that just may be too much?”\\n   \\n      As a Jewish woman, Sachs says she sometimes feels she needs to engage with friends and acquaintances about the conflict in Israel, but that is not something she feels equipped to do right now.\\n   \\n      “This isn’t necessarily my responsibility right now. It’ll be my responsibility in the future,” she added.\\n   \\n      For now, Sachs is honoring the request of her relatives in Israel who asked for more video calls to get support, and that’s what she calls her “valued action.”\\n   \\n      Movements, politics and global events don’t often happen in one day, so you have time to care for yourself and build emotional reserves so that you can engage in the way you’d like, she said.\\n   \\n      The important thing is finding ways to keep the difficult emotions from taking over, Figley said.\\n   \\n      “When a dog gets out of the pond it shakes its body, and it releases all the water,” he said. “We can’t do that.”\\n   \\n      Self-care can feel like a frustratingly vague term, but that is because what each person needs is very individualized, Sachs said.\\n   \\n      It can look like relaxing with a warm bath, venting with a close friend or putting the stress away for a moment with a fun activity, she said.\\n   \\n      Effective self-care just requires that you take time to connect with your needs and implement that care regularly.\\n   \\n      “It’s not just like a one-shot deal,” Sachs said. “It’s not like, ‘Oh, I’m going to the spa for three days, and I’m going to rejuvenate, and then I’m ready to come back.’”\\n   \\n      Figley often recommends finding someone who you feel connected with for support.\\n   \\n      “One of the most important things is to find a buddy who is in a similar kind of situation, and who also wants the same thing that you want in terms of feeling better,” he said.\\n   \\n      When you know that people in the world are suffering, it may feel selfish to take time for your own fun or relaxation, Sachs said.\\n   \\n      That’s OK, she added.\\n   \\n      “It would be weird if I didn’t feel guilty,” Sachs said. “The guilt actually makes us good at our job, but you don’t have to necessarily do anything about it.”\\n   \\n      The balance means allowing ourselves to feel both the fun and vibrancy in our lives as well as the guilt, empathy and sadness that may come. Neither emotion needs to be pushed away, she said.\\n   \\n      “There are going to be times where I am going to really feel that suffering,” Sachs added. “And then there are going to be times where I’m going to do things for myself and feel guilty that I’m not sort of bombarding myself with the suffering that comes with the human condition.”\\n   \\nGet inspired by a weekly roundup on living well, made simple.\\xa0Sign up for CNN’s Life, But Better newsletter for information and tools designed to improve your well-being.\\n',\n",

       "  'contents': ' \\n      A restroom with an out-of-this-world view could be the surprise highlight for travelers adventuring with space tourism start-up Space Perspective.\\n   \\n      The Florida-based company plans to take travelers some 100,000 feet to the edge of space via a pressurized capsule suspended from a high-tech balloon.\\n   \\n      As trips are set to last around six hours, naturally the capsule needed an onboard bathroom. When envisaging what that might look like, Space Perspective founder and co-CEO Jane Poynter and her team settled on what the British-born Poynter dubs a “loo with a view.”\\n   \\n      “Why not have a loo with a view?” Poynter tells CNN Travel.\\n \\n      Concepts from designers Dan Window and Isabella Trani depict a gleaming restroom with a large window looking out over the stars and the curvature of the earth.\\n   \\n      Poynter says the bathroom is designed to be a place travelers can take stock of their space excursion.\\n   \\n      “It’s going to be almost overwhelming at certain points,” Poynter says of the experience. “So we wanted to create a space where people could go to take time for themselves for a moment.”\\n   \\n      While the view is the main attraction, there’s also a window blind – less for privacy’s sake (there’s not exactly anyone else around) and more in case travelers want to take a moment to process.\\n   \\n      “That’s why the toilet seat itself has a cushion, so you can sit there,” adds Poynter.\\n   \\n      The bathroom design puts “wellness” at the center, according to Poynter – hence its official name “Space Spa.”\\n   \\n      When asked by CNN Travel whether that name suggests there could one day be a hot tub alongside the toilet and sink, Poynter laughs, then concedes “the capsule interior can be modified” suggesting potentially anything from a dining room table to a research could be included in the capsule.\\n   \\n      Since Dennis Tito, the first ever “space tourist” hit the skies in 2001, few travelers have followed in his footsteps. But in recent years, high-profile space tourism companies such as SpaceX, Blue Origin and Virgin Galactic have been making moves in this arena, vowing to make space the next must-visit vacation spot.\\n   \\n      Also planning excursions via a stratospheric balloon is French company Zephalto, which aims to serve up Michelin-star-level meals on the “edge of space.”\\n \\n      It’s worth remembering there’s a big difference between a trip to orbital space – involving gravity-busting high-speed takeoffs and longer duration – and suborbital space, in which travelers are briefly exposed to weightlessness and views of space during a flight to the edge of the atmosphere, 60 miles above Earth.\\n   \\n      And trips to the “edge of space” – like those proposed by Space Perspective and Zephalto – are different again.\\n   \\n      These capsules won’t actually hit suborbital space, but will still fly significantly higher than your average commercial airplane. That means great views of the Earth and the stars, but without the loss of gravity and accompanying feeling of weightlessness – hence why a swanky bathroom is possible.\\n   \\n      Space Perspective hopes to start transporting groups of up to eight passengers on flights by the end of 2024.\\n   \\n      But there are still several stages before the balloon and capsule can get off the ground so Poynter says while the company is aiming for that date, she “would suggest you don’t put that on the calendar.”\\n   \\n      The company is regulated by the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the US Coast Guard and Poynter says ensuring safety is very important to the team. Space Perspective intends to start tests fights imminently.\\n   \\n      While the exact lift off date is still TBC, Space Perspective’s $125,000 tickets are already being snapped up.\\n   \\n      “People want to be first in line,” says Poynter.\\n  ',\n",

When envisaging what that might look like, Space Perspective founder and co-CEO Jane Poynter and her team settled on what the British-born Poynter dubs a “loo with a view.”\\n   \\n      “Why not have a loo with a view?” Poynter tells CNN Travel.\\n \\n      Concepts from designers Dan Window and Isabella Trani depict a gleaming restroom with a large window looking out over the stars and the curvature of the earth.\\n   \\n      Poynter says the bathroom is designed to be a place travelers can take stock of their space excursion.\\n   \\n      “It’s going to be almost overwhelming at certain points,” Poynter says of the experience. “So we wanted to create a space where people could go to take time for themselves for a moment.”\\n   \\n      While the view is the main attraction, there’s also a window blind – less for privacy’s sake (there’s not exactly anyone else around) and more in case travelers want to take a moment to process.\\n   \\n      “That’s why the toilet seat itself has a cushion, so you can sit there,” adds Poynter.\\n   \\n      The bathroom design puts “wellness” at the center, according to Poynter – hence its official name “Space Spa.”\\n   \\n      When asked by CNN Travel whether that name suggests there could one day be a hot tub alongside the toilet and sink, Poynter laughs, then concedes “the capsule interior can be modified” suggesting potentially anything from a dining room table to a research could be included in the capsule.\\n   \\n      Since Dennis Tito, the first ever “space tourist” hit the skies in 2001, few travelers have followed in his footsteps. But in recent years, high-profile space tourism companies such as SpaceX, Blue Origin and Virgin Galactic have been making moves in this arena, vowing to make space the next must-visit vacation spot.\\n   \\n      Also planning excursions via a stratospheric balloon is French company Zephalto, which aims to serve up Michelin-star-level meals on the “edge of space.”\\n \\n      It’s worth remembering there’s a big difference between a trip to orbital space – involving gravity-busting high-speed takeoffs and longer duration – and suborbital space, in which travelers are briefly exposed to weightlessness and views of space during a flight to the edge of the atmosphere, 60 miles above Earth.\\n   \\n      And trips to the “edge of space” – like those proposed by Space Perspective and Zephalto – are different again.\\n   \\n      These capsules won’t actually hit suborbital space, but will still fly significantly higher than your average commercial airplane. That means great views of the Earth and the stars, but without the loss of gravity and accompanying feeling of weightlessness – hence why a swanky bathroom is possible.\\n   \\n      Space Perspective hopes to start transporting groups of up to eight passengers on flights by the end of 2024.\\n   \\n      But there are still several stages before the balloon and capsule can get off the ground so Poynter says while the company is aiming for that date, she “would suggest you don’t put that on the calendar.”\\n   \\n      The company is regulated by the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the US Coast Guard and Poynter says ensuring safety is very important to the team. Space Perspective intends to start tests fights imminently.\\n   \\n      While the exact lift off date is still TBC, Space Perspective’s $125,000 tickets are already being snapped up.\\n   \\n      “People want to be first in line,” says Poynter.\\n  ',\n",

       "  'contents': ' \\n      The story of Nelson Mandela’s life is well told. Whether through his autobiography “Long Walk To Freedom,” presidential memoir “Dare Not Linger,” numerous biographies, miles of newsprint, documentaries and feature films, the late president of South Africa is no mystery to the public. Yet a new book penned by his daughter aims to take a fresh perspective on the man behind the statesman.\\n   \\n      Published by maker of luxury tomes Rizzoli, “Mandela: In Honor of an Extraordinary Life” is a photographic account of the man and his family. Authored by Dr. Pumla Makaziwe Mandela, the youngest and last surviving child of Nelson and first wife Evelyn Mase, it gives an intimate view of a man on a mission to deliver a new dawn for the nation, and the family that grew along that journey.\\n   \\n      Featuring a tribute from the Reverend Al Sharpton and passages from Dr. Mandela, the book also contains never-before-seen images of the private life of Mandela and his children, released for the first time nearly 10 years since his death in December 2013 at the age of 95 in Johannesburg, South Africa.\\n   \\n      In an email to CNN, Dr. Mandela said she wrote the book “so that people have a better understanding of who he was (and) what formed him as a human being. He had a certain moral code that he adhered to that he learnt from his ancestors, and he was consistent in following that until he closed his eyes.”\\n   \\n      The book is, she said, both a tribute to her father and for her own grandchildren, “so that (they) can have a living reference of who their great grandfather was and be inspired by his courage and love for humanity.”\\n   \\n      Dr. Mandela’s account is divided into chapters looking at her father as the boy who grew up in the village of Qunu in the Eastern Cape, then as an activist, prisoner, politician and family man, as well as detailing his legacy. Some may be familiar – the conditions of his jail on Robben Island – others not, like the time a young Mandela fled to Johannesburg to escape a prospective marriage, stealing and selling a cow to pay for his travel.\\n   \\n      Despite her lifelong relationship, the author said the writing process provided the opportunity to learn more about the man she affectionately calls “Tata” (father in Xhosa). “I understood my father a bit better in terms of the sacrifices that he made,” Dr. Mandela said.\\n   \\n      “He made choices and some of those choices were not easy,” she continued. “When he grew up and went to university, he thought that would help him to assist his mother and sisters and get them out of poverty. He had regrets about the fact that he was not able to do that from a family perspective, but then again, he was successful in a larger sense because he helped achieve emancipation for his countrymen.\\n   \\n      “Change is not easy and takes a lot of courage, determination and consistency. He realized that bringing about a new dispensation in South Africa would take all of us as a collective and bring the entire country along.”\\n   \\n      Ahead of the book’s publication, CNN asked Dr. Mandela to share her thoughts and memories on a selection of family photographs being made public for the first time.

According to Shin, Hwang’s parents weren’t enthusiastic about a playing career and he also “wasn’t an elite player.”\\n   \\n      So Hwang was forced to turn to greener pastures for a future career, and in Shin, he had an ideal role model, as he had already made strides in transitioning into a career as a basketball referee.\\n   \\n      Since switching dunks and free-throws for whistles and ejections, Hwang has risen up the ranks of global refereeing and in this 2023-24 season, all his hard work will be rewarded as becomes the first NBA staff referee from outside of North America.\\n   \\n      “When In-tae left for America, I urged him not to come back midway and to come back after accomplishing his dream,” says Shin, explaining his pride in his refereeing protege.\\n   \\n      “I know it wasn’t an easy process for him.

       "  'contents': ' \\n      You’ve seen them on TikTok and on Instagram: people flying on the new generation of long-haul, low-cost airlines where the fares sound too good to be true.\\n   \\n      Flights from New York to Paris for $200? They’re out there, if you’re able to be flexible, and if you’re willing to skip extras —\\xa0depending on the airline, that could include checked bags, meals, entertainment and the bar cart.\\n   \\n      But what’s different on each of these independent airlines? Let’s break it down.\\n   \\n      Comparing long-haul, low-cost carriers to other airlines that bill themselves as “full-service,” you’ll often get the same newer planes like the Boeing 787 and Airbus A350, sometimes with the same seats and entertainment screens. To an extent, airline food is airline food, and many folks already pack their own meals even on full-service airlines.\\n   \\n      These carriers can be a great deal if you go into them with the understanding that you’re paying low-cost fares, so you should expect a low-cost experience onboard.\\n   \\n      Overall,\\xa0set your expectations low, remember how little you paid, and then you might be pleasantly surprised.\\n   \\n      By and large, long-haul, low-cost airlines focus on four specific markets: transatlantic, transpacific, southeast Asia and Australia. That’s where the flights are long enough to be long-haul, but where passengers are numerous enough for the airline to make money.\\n   \\n      This type of airline usually makes news for all the wrong reasons: did you hear about that one airline that charges for power sockets, and doesn’t allow you to bring your own food? How about the one with 12-hour flights with no seatback entertainment screens? The overnight flight with no included meals? Or the airlines that put an extra seat in every row to really pack people in?\\n \\n      But for the savvy traveler, the low prices can be a steal. Do be sure you’re not caught out when it comes to exactly what kind of ticket you’re booking, and what kind of seat you’ll get, though.\\n   \\n      Some airlines like Frenchbee and AirAsia X pack an extra seat into every row of their airplanes, which means they’re really narrow. Some, like Zipair and Scoot, don’t have inflight entertainment, even in business class. Scoot even charges for power sockets in economy!\\n   \\n      There are great deals to be had out there, whether you’re aiming for the absolute cheapest flight or you are interested in a low-cost premium economy (or in a couple of cases, low-cost business class) experience.\\n   \\n      But how do you what you’re going to get?\\n   \\n      Check each airline’s website carefully for what is and isn’t included in each ticket type, as well as pricing and other details, such as:\\n   \\n-Food.

       "  'contents': ' \\n      Prosecutors grilled former crypto king Sam Bankman-Fried on Monday as his criminal fraud trial entered its third week. He stands accused of orchestrating a multibillion-dollar fraud in a seismic event that has left the industry reeling.\\n   \\n      While prosecutors have cast SBF as a Bernie Madoff-like mastermind, Bankman-Fried’s lawyers argue that “it’s not a crime to be the CEO of a company that later files for bankruptcy.”\\n   \\n      For his own part, Bankman-Fried has largely offered vague responses on cross-examination so far, saying he does not recall conversations or statements he made in the past. Judge Lewis Kaplan has at least twice interjected to instruct Bankman-Fried to simply answer yes or no and stop trying to infer intentions from those questioning him.\\n   \\n      Monday’s testimony kicked off with the former billionaire describing the days leading up to FTX’s bankruptcy filing on November 11 last year.\\n   \\n      On November 6, FTX saw about $1 billion of net withdrawals in response to a tweet from the CEO of FTX’s bigger rival, Binance. The pace of withdrawals then increased further, with about $4 billion in net withdrawals the following day, or 100 times more than a typical day.\\n   \\n      “I was concerned,” Bankman-Fried testified Monday. “It signaled a potential run on the bank and a risk of a liquidity crisis.”\\n   \\n      That led him to send the tweet that has been central to the government’s argument that he lied to customers and investors about the state of his companies.\\n   \\n      The tweet — which said FTX and its assets were both “fine” —\\xa0was accurate at the time he posted it on the morning of November 7, he told jurors. But as the market crashed further that evening and into the following morning, “we were risking a solvency crisis,” Bankman-Fried said.\\n   \\n      A market downturn meant that assets associated with FTX’s sister company, the hedge fund Alameda Research, “declined massively in value,” he said. The\\xa0approximately 50% crash in Alameda’s assets drove the firm’s net asset value from around $10 billion to a little bit above zero, SBF testified.\\n   \\n      At that time, he said, he deleted his earlier tweet.\\n   \\n      Bankman-Fried on Monday recalled a conversation he had with Caroline Ellison, his ex-girlfriend and then-CEO of Alameda Research. He was worried, he said, that if the market decreased another 50% then Alameda would become insolvent.\\n   \\n      “She started crying,” he said. “She agreed…that Alameda should have hedged.” He added that she “offered to step down,” which he said was her decision alone.\\n   \\n      According\\xa0to SBF, the two agreed that the\\xa0“focus should be urgently putting on the hedges” to prevent Alameda\\xa0from\\xa0going bankrupt.\\n   \\n      Ellison, who pleaded guilty in cooperation with the government, testified earlier that she wanted to quit but that Bankman-Fried told her she was “too important” to Alameda.\\n   \\n      US Assistant Attorney Danielle Sassoon called up multiple instances of Bankman-Fried stating publicly that Alameda Research did not have special privileges and that the two firms operated independently of one another.\\n   \\n      Bankman-Fried repeatedly pushed back, stating that he didn’t recall what he told reporters in various interviews. Asked to answer “yes” or “no,” Bankman-Fried equivocated and parsed the prosecutor’s wording.\\n   \\n      “Do you recall saying FTX and Alameda acted separately?” Sassoon asked.\\n   \\n      “I’m not sure about the exact phrasing,” he replied.\\n   \\n      Just before the court broke for lunch, Sassoon pressed Bankman-Fried on the issue of Alameda’s special treatment.\\n   \\n      Sassoon: “Do you deny that Alameda could withdraw billions of dollars from the FTX exchange using a line of credit without being subject to the auto liquidation protocol?”\\n   \\n      “That might be right,” he said.\\n   \\n      “You don’t deny it?” Sassoon asked.\\n   \\n      “I don’t deny it, no,” Bankman-Fried replied.\\n   \\n      While Bankman-Fried publicly advocated for crypto regulation, Sassoon suggested Monday that this support was “just for PR.”\\n   \\n      “No.” Bankman-Fried replied.\\n   \\n      Sassoon then referenced an exchange SBF had with a reporter in which he said “f*ck regulators” and that his advocacy was “just PR.”\\n   \\n      Another private conversation showed SBF calling some customers “dumb m*therf**kers.”\\n   \\n      SBF pushed back on the question, saying that comment referred only to a “specific subset” of customers.\\n   \\n      SBF is expected back for another full day of questioning on Tuesday, at which point the defense will redirect. The entire trial is nearing the finish line, with closing arguments likely to be presented on Thursday.\\n   \\n      Thirty-one-year-old Bankman-Fried faces the rest of his life in prison if found guilty on all seven federal criminal charges of fraud and conspiracy.\\n  ',\n",

Asked to answer “yes” or “no,” Bankman-Fried equivocated and parsed the prosecutor’s wording.\\n   \\n      “Do you recall saying FTX and Alameda acted separately?” Sassoon asked.\\n   \\n      “I’m not sure about the exact phrasing,” he replied.\\n   \\n      Just before the court broke for lunch, Sassoon pressed Bankman-Fried on the issue of Alameda’s special treatment.\\n   \\n      Sassoon: “Do you deny that Alameda could withdraw billions of dollars from the FTX exchange using a line of credit without being subject to the auto liquidation protocol?”\\n   \\n      “That might be right,” he said.\\n   \\n      “You don’t deny it?” Sassoon asked.\\n   \\n      “I don’t deny it, no,” Bankman-Fried replied.\\n   \\n      While Bankman-Fried publicly advocated for crypto regulation, Sassoon suggested Monday that this support was “just for PR.”\\n   \\n      “No.” Bankman-Fried replied.\\n   \\n      Sassoon then referenced an exchange SBF had with a reporter in which he said “f*ck regulators” and that his advocacy was “just PR.”\\n   \\n      Another private conversation showed SBF calling some customers “dumb m*therf**kers.”\\n   \\n      SBF pushed back on the question, saying that comment referred only to a “specific subset” of customers.\\n   \\n      SBF is expected back for another full day of questioning on Tuesday, at which point the defense will redirect. The entire trial is nearing the finish line, with closing arguments likely to be presented on Thursday.\\n   \\n      Thirty-one-year-old Bankman-Fried faces the rest of his life in prison if found guilty on all seven federal criminal charges of fraud and conspiracy.\\n  ',\n",

       " {'headline': '\\n      Europe’s biggest economy shrank in the third quarter, spelling trouble for the region\\n    ',\n",
       "  'contents': ' \\n      Output in Germany fell slightly in the third quarter, official data showed Monday, increasing the risk of a recession in Europe’s biggest economy.\\n   \\n      Gross domestic product dropped 0.1% in the July-to-September period compared with the previous quarter, when it grew 0.1%, according to Germany’s Federal Statistical Office (Destatis).\\n   \\n      A fall in consumer spending drove the decline. On the other hand, investment by companies into machinery and equipment made a positive contribution to GDP, Destatis said.\\n   \\n      The data bodes ill for the entire area that uses the euro because Germany is the largest of its 20 economies.\\n   \\n      “Germany’s economy is once again teetering on the brink of a technical recession,” said Claus Vistesen, chief eurozone economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. A technical recession is defined as two consecutive quarters of declining output.\\n   \\n      The German economy has been flirting with recession for almost a year. GDP shrank in the final three months of 2022 before stagnating in the first quarter of this year, according to revised data from Destatis. (An initial estimate by the statistics office had shown two consecutive quarters of declining output.)\\n   \\n      Economists say the picture is unlikely to improve soon, as the country’s vast manufacturing sector grapples with weak Chinese demand, high energy costs and painful interest rate hikes. Companies in the sector are shedding jobs at the fastest rate in three years, as new orders decline and confidence remains “deeply negative,” according to survey data for October published last week.\\n   \\n      “Germany’s economy is now firmly stuck in the mud,” Vistesen said, noting that it was doubtful the economy would recover in the fourth quarter. “Risks are tilted to the downside for the start of 2024,” he added.\\n   \\n      There was better news on inflation. Consumer prices rose 3% on average in October compared with a year ago, according to an initial estimate published by Destatis Monday. This marked a sharp slowdown from a rate of 4.3% in September.\\n   \\n      A drop in energy prices over the past year — from very high levels last fall — dampened this month’s inflation reading, Destatis said.\\n   \\n      While Germany’s economy may be particularly hard-hit, business activity in the rest of the euro area has also been lackluster and economists think a period of stagnation, or even a mild recession, is looming in the region.\\n   \\n      A recent survey of companies in the eurozone’s manufacturing and services sectors signaled a steep decline in output in October. The outlook for demand for goods and services also worsened.\\n   \\n      Last week, the European Central Bank kept interest rates unchanged — breaking a spell of 10 consecutive rate hikes — following a sharp drop in eurozone inflation in September and more evidence of economic weakness. ECB President Christine Lagarde warned that risks to growth “remain tilted to the downside” and said the Israel-Hamas war meant a “less predictable” outlook for energy prices.\\n   \\n      Still, third-quarter GDP data in the euro area is a “mixed bag so far,” according to Bert Colijn, senior eurozone economist at Dutch bank ING. He pointed out that, while Germany and Austria contracted, Belgium and Spain grew strongly. “This makes it likely that\\xa0eurozone GDP did not contract in the third quarter\\xa0— but a small decline in the fourth quarter\\xa0is a realistic prospect,” he wrote in a note. \\n \\n      Euro area GDP data is due out Tuesday.\\n  ',\n",

       " {'headline': '\\n      GM and the UAW come to tentative agreement\\n    ',\n",
       "  'contents': ' \\n      General Motors and the United Auto Workers union have come to a tentative agreement, the union and company announced Monday afternoon, just two days after the union expanded the strike at America’s largest automaker.\\n   \\n      The tentative deal could bring an end to the union’s unprecedented strike against all three of the nation’s unionized automakers.\\n   \\n      “Like the agreements with Ford and Stellantis, the GM agreement has turned record profits into a record contract,” said a statement from the union.\\n   \\n      “GM is pleased to have reached a tentative agreement with the UAW that reflects the contributions of the team while enabling us to continue to invest in our future and provide good jobs in the U.S.,” said GM Chair and CEO Mary Barra.\\n   \\n      Full details of the deal are not yet known, but its broad terms follow the lines of the deals already announced at Ford and Stellantis, including an immediate 11% raise in the top hourly wage rate, additional pay hikes totaling another 14% during the four-and-a-half years of the contract, as well as a return of the cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) meant to protect workers from rising prices. When the COLA and guaranteed pay increases are combined together, they could lift members’ pay more than 30% over the life of the contract.\\n   \\n      Less senior workers not already at the top pay scale would get even larger pay increases, perhaps as much as 150%. And temporary workers would be made permanent full-time workers after a few months on the job. There would also be improved retirement benefits for senior workers who have traditional pension plans and larger company contributions to the 401(k) plans of workers hired since 2007.\\n   \\nThe union went on strike against all three automakers on September 15, nearly seven weeks ago, making this the longest US auto strike in 25 years. It started with a strike at one assembly plant at each company, but it expanded the scope of the strike six times since then in an effort to step up pressure on the companies at the bargaining table.\\n   \\n      The union announced its first deal, with Ford, on Wednesday and then announced a deal with Stellantis on Saturday. But it failed to reach a deal with GM at that time, despite indications the two were close to a deal. Instead, it expanded the strike to a fourth assembly plant, this one in Spring Hill, Tennessee, as nearly 4,000 UAW members joined the strike at that time.\\n   \\n      All three tentative deals will need to be ratified by rank-and-file members before they take effect. And it is possible that members at one or more companies could vote down the tentative deal, leading to a resumption of the strike at that company.\\n   \\n      The financial gains in the deals could help it to win approval from the rank-and-file membership, but ratification is not certain. There have been numerous examples in recent years in which rank-and-file members voted down a deal recommended by union leadership, leading to a strike. Most recently that happened at Mack Trucks, where nearly 4,000 UAW members went on strike on October 8 after voting no on their own tentative agreement. The Mack Truck workers remain on strike.\\n   \\n      The deals at Ford and Stellantis did not just provide financial wins for the union. It also improved job security, as there were promises of new products at some plants that might have been set to close otherwise.\\n   \\n      Some of those plants make engines or transmission parts, which are needed in a traditional gas-powered vehicle, but not in an electric vehicle. All automakers have announced plans to shift from traditional internal combustion engine vehicles to EVs in the coming decades, which the union is concerned could cost jobs at engine and transmission plants.\\n   \\n      UAW President Shawn Fain previously said that the union won an important agreement in talks with GM to have workers at a series of EV battery plants it has opened or is building to be included in the labor agreement for its plants. Details of that agreement are not yet clear. Fain said over the weekend that Ford is also agreeing to similar agreements for its EV and battery plants.\\n   \\n      Another job security provision of the Ford and Stellantis deals comes from the union winning a right to strike during the life of the contract to protest any new plant closings. In the past, the union worked under a no-strike clause that remained in effect during the life of a contract, so a company could close a plant without worrying about a strike threat.\\n   \\n      There are a total of more than 18,000 UAW members at GM now on strike, though they will be returning to work within days. The 16,600 strikers at Ford have already returned to work, and more than 14,000 Stellantis strikers are in the process of returning to work.\\n   \\n      Typically when a union goes on strike, and then reaches a tentative deal, the workers don’t return to work until the ratification process is completed. That’s what happened when a deal was reached to end the six-week strike at GM in 2019.\\n   \\n      But the union had workers at Ford start to return to work in order to step up pressure on GM and Stellantis to match the agreement at Ford. When Stellantis agreed to the deal Saturday night, the union not only announced its strikers would return to work, but it announced that nearly 4,000 members at a GM plant in Spring Hill, Tennessee, would join the strike.\\n   \\n      Having the GM strikers follow that path of returning to work during the ratification process allows the members to start getting paychecks again. While the members on strike have received a $500 a week strike benefit from the union, that is only a fraction of the pay they would receive while on the job.\\n   \\n      The strike had a total of nearly 50,000 UAW members on strike at one point or another, although not all at the same time. It cost GM $200 million in the last two weeks of September, and another $600 million in the first three weeks of October.\\n   \\n      The costs per week have likely increased since then, as the union added GM’s largest plant in Arlington, Texas, to the strike a week ago. That one portion of the strike likely cost GM about $130 million a week, according to an estimate from Well Fargo.\\n   \\n      The UAW strikes against the three automakers are not the only ones disrupting operations in the North American auto industry. Unifor, the union that represents autoworkers in Canada, staged two very brief strikes at GM and Stellantis plants there.\\n   \\n      On October 10 it struck GM’s Canadian plants, but reached a deal to end that work stoppage in about 13 hours. At 11:59 pm ET Sunday it declared a strike at Stellantis, but it continued to talk through the night and announced a tentative agreement and an end of the strike at 7:36 am Monday. Both strikes had the potential to cause shutdowns at US plants at the companies had they lasted more than a day.\\n   \\n      The strike has been particularly high profile in a period of intense activity by the nation’s labor unions. President Joe Biden became the first sitting president to join a picket line when he visited strikers outside a GM facility in Michigan last month.\\n   \\n      Biden heralded the tentative agreement this morning, giving reporters a thumbs up as he boarded Air Force One in Delaware, and telling them “I think it’s great” when asked about the deal.\\n   \\n      During the UAW strike, a coalition of unions at Kaiser Permanente had 75,000 workers walk out in the largest US health care strike in history. There are also 160,000 actors striking Hollywood studios and streaming services.\\n   \\nCNN’s Betsy Klein contributed to this report.\\n',\n",

       " {'headline': '\\n      Google CEO Sundar Pichai defends search deal with Apple in landmark antitrust trial\\n    ',\n",
       "  'contents': ' \\n      Google CEO Sundar Pichai took the stand Monday\\xa0to\\xa0defend the search giant in the largest tech antitrust trial since the Microsoft case of the 1990s, marking a climactic moment in the US government’s weeks-long effort to prove that Google has illegally monopolized the online search market.\\n   \\n      Pichai, whom Google called as a star witness, opened his testimony at the US District Court for the District of Columbia by recounting his journey from Chennai, India to Google and his path to becoming the tech company’s CEO in 2015.\\n   \\n      Standing at a podium in a dark suit, crisp white shirt and gray tie, Pichai described how Google’s investments in Chrome, its proprietary web browser, accelerated users’ experiences with popular websites and led them to conduct more Google searches.\\n   \\n      The history lesson is central to Google’s defense that the company’s search dominance owes to people preferring Google because it is the best, not because it behaved illegally to gain and preserve a monopoly.\\n   \\n      By making Google’s search engine a seamless part of the Chrome browser, and by offering users a minimalist design that created more room for search results and web content within a browser window, Google believed it would drive more search usage, Pichai testified.\\n   \\n      “The correlation was pretty clear to see,” Pichai said, before Google attorney John Schmidtlein presented an internal email from 2010 showing research that users who switched from Microsoft’s Internet Explorer performed 48% more Google searches.\\xa0Users of Mozilla’s Firefox browser that switched to Chrome performed 27% more searches on Google, the email said.\\n   \\n      Pichai’s testimony represents Google’s attempt to rebut claims by rivals including Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, who\\xa0testified last month\\xa0that Google has thwarted competition in search and risks dominating the artificial intelligence sector by training its large language models on search query data that it controls.\\n   \\n      The US government case against Google focuses on the company’s web of contracts that make its search engine the default on millions of devices and browsers around the globe. Google has paid Apple more than an estimated $10 billion a year to be the default on Apple devices and software. In 2021, Google paid $26.3 billion to secure default agreements with its partners worldwide, according to a slide introduced in the trial last week.\\n   \\n      Google pays Apple more money in search-default payments than it pays to any Android handset maker for search distribution, Pichai acknowledged, but “a big part of the difference” is that Google has separate deals with Android smartphone manufacturers and telecom carriers, whereas Apple “is both the [original equipment manufacturer] and they have control over their telecom channels,” making the Apple figure appear larger, he testified.\\n   \\n      A key question throughout the trial has been why Google has seen fit to pay Apple and other search distribution partners such large sums if it is as easy as Google claims for users to switch search providers.\\n   \\n      Asked that question point-blank by Google’s own lawyers, Pichai did not shy away from acknowledging a connection between a search engine’s default status and increased scale.\\n   \\n      “Making it the default,” he said, “we know it would lead to increased usage of our products and services. There’s clearly value to that, and that’s what we were looking to do” with Google’s distribution deals.\\n   \\n      As Google has renegotiated its lucrative and notoriously opaque contract with Apple over the years — in 2016 and again in 2021 — Google moved to limit how Apple could treat search queries its users entered into its products, Pichai testified. Because Apple chooses which queries to refer to Google, and which it seeks to answer through Apple’s own search technology, Google feared that Apple might, for example, decide to send some search queries to Amazon.\\n   \\n      “We wanted to make sure that as we contemplate a longer-term deal that the notion of default is implemented in a similar way” going forward, Pichai said, reflecting on his negotiations with Apple services chief Eddy Cue in 2016.\\n   \\n      Later in Pichai’s testimony, the Justice Department tried to draw contrasts between Google’s strong desire to be the default search engine for millions of internet users on the one hand and its vocal objections to Microsoft appearing to make Bing the effective default search engine in Internet Explorer.\\n   \\n      That year, Google sent Microsoft a lengthy letter outlining concerns about possible competition issues raised by Microsoft’s practice, according to an exhibit introduced in court.\\n   \\n      “We are deeply concerned about the potential of harm to the competitive process from Microsoft’s actions,” Google wrote at the time, reminding Microsoft of its own past run-ins with antitrust regulators.\\n   \\n      On Monday, a US government attorney pressed Pichai to acknowledge how the letter and other examples proved that Google considers search defaults to be extremely valuable — both financially and in terms of driving user search behavior generally.\\n   \\n      But Pichai disputed any potential parallels between the two situations, describing Google’s deals as standard promotional agreements. Microsoft’s practice, he suggested, raised concerns because it did not adequately inform users of their opportunity to select a different search provider; instead, he said, Internet Explorer simply imported a user’s prior preference, and if the user had not made a selection, it would default to Bing.\\n   \\n      Government lawyers sought to prove that Google feared Apple getting more involved in search, pointing to a 2019 email in which Pichai asked a subordinate to email him anytime an employee from Google’s search business left to work for Apple.\\n   \\n      That specific request came as Pichai noted several employee departures and the recruitment efforts of John Giannandrea, a former Google search exec who went to oversee search efforts at Apple (and who has\\xa0also testified\\xa0in the trial). Apple has testified that it has always viewed Google as the best search engine for its users, even as it considered alternatives such as partnering with Microsoft on search or even buying Bing outright.\\n   \\n      In the afternoon, Pichai acknowledged to the court: “There have been moments where people at Google have been concerned about Apple as a potential competitor” in search, without referencing any specific timeframe.\\n   \\n      Regarding the 2019 email exchange, Pichai testified that his request\\xa0— which also called for a monthly report on “all losses [of talent] to key competitors” — was an attempt to respond to pleas for help from Google’s search team amid more generalized fears of talent loss.\\n   \\n      Pichai wryly added that he didn’t believe he ever received any of the reports he asked for.\\n   \\n      Pichai bristled at suggestions by a lawyer representing a group of US states that Google may have paid Apple partly to keep it from entering the search market, saying instead that Google kept renewing the Apple agreement because the deal was beneficial on its own merits for Google’s search volume and ad revenues as well as for Apple users.\\n   \\n      The Apple-Google relationship has not always been perfectly smooth, Pichai testified. In December 2018, Pichai met with Apple CEO Tim Cook. (Pichai said that as part of the Apple agreement, he and Cook meet roughly annually to discuss their deal.) On the agenda: Cook’s concerns that Apple’s revenue growth linked to the deal did not appear to keep pace with Google’s.\\n   \\n      Apple wanted to know what accounted for the difference, according to a Google summary of the nearly two-hour meeting entered into evidence Monday.\\n   \\n      Google essentially told Apple at the meeting that any discrepancy was likely due to Apple’s own failings in search and not the fault of Google.\\n   \\n      “Google is not in control of the amount or type of traffic received by Safari; Apple is,” Google argued in the meeting, according to the summary.\\n   \\n      Though both companies continued to view the search deal as mutually beneficial, and Cook appeared “very motivated to work to find a good experience for our joint users,” Pichai testified, the meeting was also “tense” at times and some participants were “nervous” heading into it.\\n   \\n      To help smooth things over, during the meeting Pichai proposed building a dedicated Google app or widget to be be preloaded on Apple’s iOS that could allow users to access Google search right from their home screens.\\n   \\n      Cook “listened\\xa0but did not react to this specifically other than noting we had different strengths,” the Google summary read.\\n   \\n      US prosecutors also clashed with Pichai over Google’s handling of internal communications that it knew could end up being included in future litigation. In an extended exchange, DOJ pushed Pichai to explain a company policy that, until this February, automatically deleted employee chat messages older than 24 hours. The practice has been\\xa0repeatedly flagged\\xa0as\\xa0allegedly evasive\\xa0by Google’s critics.\\n   \\n      Google’s chat policy was set in 2008 by the company’s legal team prior to his becoming CEO, Pichai explained to a government attorney. The attorney pointed out that Pichai made no effort to change the policy upon\\xa0becoming CEO; Pichai agreed, saying it “was not a change that came to my attention.”\\n   \\n      At one point, DOJ showed a 2021 chat log involving Pichai and his communications assistant in which he asked for chat history to be turned off, before deleting that request nine seconds later.\\n   \\n      Pichai said he rarely, if ever, asks for chat history to be deactivated, and that in this case the chat conversation could have involved personal information related to a public event linked to Google’s cloud business for which he had been preparing.\\n  ',\n",

       "  'contents': ' \\n      HSBC warned Monday that China’s property market has “potential for a further deterioration” as it reported profits that fell short of expectations, partly because of a $500 million charge to cover potential losses on commercial real estate loans.\\n   \\n      Third quarter pre-tax profit at Europe’s biggest bank more than doubled to $7.7 billion. Revenue rose 40% year-on-year to $16.2 billion as the lender reported higher interest income.\\n   \\n      The results, however, fell shy of expectations from analysts, who had projected about $8.1 billion in pre-tax profit and revenue of $16.3 billion.\\n   \\n      HSBC has benefited from the higher costs of borrowing in recent months. In the third quarter, “there was good broad-based growth across all businesses and geographies, supported by the interest rate environment,” CEO Noel Quinn said in a statement.\\n   \\n      But the UK-based bank also warned of ongoing risks that could affect its lending business, flagging an exposure to China that caused a hit to another Asia-focused lender, Standard Chartered, last week.\\n   \\n      In the third quarter, HSBC (HSBC) said it had adjusted its expected credit losses — the money it sets aside for defaults on loans — to include a charge of $500 million related to commercial real estate in mainland China.\\n   \\n      The charge was “related to heightened economic uncertainty, inflation and rising interest rates, as well as from ongoing developments” in the sector, according to the bank.\\n   \\n      This year, China’s property crisis has once again become a sore point for investors as developers continue to bleed cash and fight a protracted sales slump.\\n   \\n      HSBC said it expected Chinese government support to lead to a gradual improvement in sales in parts of the market, such as housing, but it continued to see risks from “sustained stress in the mainland China commercial real estate market.”\\n   \\n      “We continue to closely monitor, and seek to proactively manage, the potential implications of the prolonged recovery of the real estate sector and the overall Chinese economic outlook for our customers and our business,” HSBC added.\\n   \\n      “There is potential for a further deterioration in credit conditions during the last three months of the year given the continued uncertainty around liquidity support.”\\n   \\n      On an analyst call Monday, Quinn said while the industry could bear some further losses, “I think the market itself has bottomed.”\\n   \\n      “Now we’re in a period of readjustment for the new norm,” he added. “I don’t see a big swing back … I see it as fine tuning from this low base.”\\n   \\n      The conditions have put similar pressure on Standard Chartered, which last Thursday also reported a $186 million credit impairment charge related to commercial real estate in mainland China.\\n   \\n      HSBC has fared better, with its latest results showing strength overall, Jefferies analysts wrote in a note Monday.\\n   \\n      In a sign of renewed confidence, HSBC said Monday it would conduct another share buyback of up to $3 billion, following similar announcements in recent months. It also announced another interim dividend of 10 cents per share, its third so far this year.\\n   \\n      HSBC shares were little changed in London following its results, while its stock listed in Hong Kong closed down 1.5%.\\n  ',\n",

And in the world of chocolate, milk chocolate is king: more people bought milk chocolate last Halloween season\\xa0than all other non-chocolate candy combined.\\n   \\n      But while per unit sales of chocolate candy have remained largely stable compared with five years ago, non-chocolate candy is the growth market. Americans bought roughly 7.8% more packages of non-chocolate candy last Halloween season compared to 2018, while package sales of chocolate shrank by 2.5%.\\n   \\n      But there’s one notable exception to non-chocolate candy’s dolce vita: Halloween’s iconic candy corn.\\n   \\n      Americans are buying less and less candy corn, NIQ data shows, and more gummies and marshmallows.\\n   \\n      The number of candy corn packages sold during the Halloween season – or the six weeks leading up to the first week of November – have been falling every year since at least 2018, reaching a low of 12.7 million in 2022. As of October 14, Americans have bought 5.3 million packages of the candy this season.\\n   \\n      “It’s not like, ‘Yeah, it’s OK,’” Beth Kimmerle, the author of “Candy: The Sweet History” and founder of the food industry data company Attribute Analytics, said of Americans’ taste for candy corn. “Either people love it or hate it.”\\n   \\n      By comparison, package sales of gummies and marshmallow candy, which includes Peeps, have each gone up more than 30% since 2018.\\n   \\n      “So think about a Peep,” Kimmerle said. “You can coat it with sugar, you can colorize that sugar, you can color the inside of it. You can make it into different shapes. There is a lot of flexibility that you can have with marshmallows.”\\n   \\n      “The flavor is very, very sweet,” said Susan Benjamin, a candy historian and president of the True Treats candy store in West Virginia. “But it’s not really describable sweetness. And often it sort of defies what it should look like.”\\n   \\n      In a flavor profile conducted by Attribute Analytics on Oct. 8, the taste panel found candy corn is high on the “sweet” flavor while its other flavors are less noticeable and dissipate quickly, according to Kimmerle. The panel described a bag of Nice! Brand candy corn’s flavors as “sweet,” followed by artificial vanilla, caramelized sugar and “chemical.”\\n   \\n      By contrast, the flavor profile of a variety pack of Albanese Gummi Bear Cubs conducted that same day shows a range of various flavors that linger longer in your mouth and build on one another, Kimmerle said: sweet, artificial cherry, artificial fruit and sour.\\n   \\n      Candy corn is offered in other flavors as well, but Kimmerle also emphasizes the importance of a candy’s texture.\\n   \\n      “Gummies bounce around playfully in your mouth while you’re chewing and then they dissolve,” Kimmerle said. Candy corn, by contrast, feels grainy and crystallized, she said.\\n   \\n      “It’s not a marshmallow, it’s not a hard candy. It’s somewhere in between,” Kimmerle said.\\n   \\n      Without an appealing texture or flavor, what reasons are left to buy candy corn?\\n   \\n      “I would put it into the category of something that people feel compelled to buy because of the nostalgia factor,” Kimmerle said.\\n   \\n      Benjamin also sees the sentimental appeal of candy corn.\\n   \\n      “I remember it from my childhood, and the younger people don’t,” she said. “And candy is as much about memory as it is about the actual taste.”\\n  ',\n",

       " {'headline': '\\n      This Florida town full of mediums has been luring believers, the curious and the skeptical for more than a century\\n    ',\n",
       "  'contents': ' \\n      Just when you think you finally know Florida, it goes ahead and throws a town full of mediums into the mix.\\n   \\n      Roughly 50 miles from Orlando’s theme parks, Cassadaga is a bucolic Central Florida enclave where the streets are tunneled with oak trees draped in Spanish moss, and brightly-painted Victorian-style homes are decorated with stained glass sunflowers, peace signs and statues of angels.\\n   \\n      And an outsized share of the residents are mediums who claim they can communicate with the dead.\\n   \\n      An unincorporated area of Volusia County, Cassadaga is home to the Southern Cassadaga Spiritualist Camp, a community founded around the religious movement Spiritualism that is “based upon the principle of continuous life demonstrated through Mediumship,” according to the camp’s official press kit.\\n   \\n      The fundamental belief of Spiritualism revolves around the “continuity of life,” or the belief that the body may die but the spirit continues to exist – and that it’s possible for the living (mediums) to communicate with the dead, who Spiritualists often refer to as “spirit” or the “other side of life.”\\n   \\n      The Southern Cassadaga Spiritualist Camp believes in God, Jesus and the Bible, according to its fact sheet, but does not embrace a “Savior-God philosophy” that involves the devil or “falling from grace.”\\n   \\n      The modern spiritualist movement traces its roots to New York in 1848, when two sisters are said to have started communicating with a spirit making knocking sounds in their home.\\n   \\n      In the 19th and early 20th centuries, the new movement was met with opposition and condemnation from church leaders, who equated the attempts of mediums to communicate with spirits with witchcraft. Some mediums who used magicians to “prove” their clairvoyance were exposed as swindlers, with none other than Harry Houdini among those jumping in to expose fraudulent practices.\\n   \\n      Florida’s Southern Cassadaga Spiritualist Camp dates back to 1894 after its founder, a New York Spiritualist named George Colby, is said to have been led to the location by a spirit guide named “Seneca” after being told during a seance that he would found a southern Spiritualist community. Colby had been part of the Lily Dale Camp in New York, which still exists today as the Lily Dale Assembly and claims to be the largest community of Spiritualists in the world.\\n   \\n      Cassadaga Spiritualists maintain that Spiritualism is a religion, a philosophy, as well as a science. It’s a science “because it investigates, analyzes, and classifies facts and manifestations of Spirit,” according to the camp’s published definitions. These manifestations can occur during medium sessions, which can involve a medium working with a group or an individual, or seances, when groups sitting in a darkened room seek contact with the spirit world.\\n \\n      If that sounds like a lot of history and lore to digest, visiting Cassadaga to see for yourself what Spiritualism and Spiritualists are about might give you a better understanding.\\n   \\n      Drive about 50 miles northeast of Orlando’s theme parks, duck off the Interstate and down a few country roads and you’ll arrive in a 57-acre historic district, the Southern Cassadaga Spiritualist Camp. It’s listed on the National Register of Historic Places and is home to mediums, healers and members of Spiritualism, who live in roughly 44 homes on land leased to them by the camp. Some offer their services to the public.\\n   \\n      Just outside the official camp (marked by two white pillars at the top of Stevens Street), C. Green’s Haunted History House & Museum and the Purple Rose Trading Co. are among a handful of businesses that are not affiliated with the camp and trade in things like tarot readings, numerology sessions and copious crystals. It’s worth noting that camp mediums do not use tools such as tarot cards or crystals in their readings, which involve mental communication.\\n   \\n      At the 10-room Ann Stevens House, a historic bed and breakfast that dates to 1895 and was built by one of the camp’s first Spiritualists, the grounds include two alleged vortexes, spots on the earth considered by some to be energy centers. \\xa0\\n \\n      And back on camp grounds, the Hotel Cassadaga, built in 1927 and said to be haunted, once belonged to the Spiritualist community but now operates independently, housing a cast of tarot card readers, reiki masters, seance-givers and even a haunted house attraction during Halloween season. There’s also a surprisingly good Italian restaurant, Sinatra’s, offering dueling piano two Fridays a month and karaoke every Saturday evening alongside platters of burrata and calamari.\\xa0And it wouldn’t be a haunted hotel without a gift shop stocked with more crystals, palo santo clearing spray, dream catchers and the like.\\n   \\n      If you’ve come to Cassadaga for the official Spiritualist deal, however, your first stop should be the camp’s Andrew Jackson Davis Educational Building/Bookstore, a circa 1905 building named for a Spiritualist pioneer and the official welcome center. A sign outside claims “Home of Certified Mediums Est. 1894” and Cassadaga T-shirts for sale inside say “Where Mayberry meets the Twilight Zone.”\\n   \\n      On any given day, busloads of tourists from retirement communities like The Villages, mingle with visitors from around the world.\\n   \\n      The bookstore brims with the catchall commodities of new age spirituality and mysticism – books about miracles, billowy elephant-emblazoned pants that look ready for a full moon party, bundles of sage and packets of gemstones that claim to assuage everything from bad dreams and addictions to menopause.\\n   \\n      In a room at the back, a cork bulletin board covered with flyers advertises ongoing events that range from Native American Talking Stick Circles, Reiki Healing Circles, Encounter the Spirits Night Tours ($30) and even a crochet circle. This is also where you’ll find a thick white binder holding the bios of the camp’s roughly 35 working mediums and a white board with the names of those currently available for walk-in sessions, which range in price from $50 to $200 per hour. Conveniently, there’s an ATM nearby as cash, paid directly to your medium of choice, is generally preferred. Clients can also contact the camp’s mediums and healers to book in advance.\\n   \\n      “Look at the bios and select the person that you feel as though you’re gravitating to,” said Deb Jordan, 66, a certified medium and healer who sits on the camp’s board of trustees. “We prefer people select a medium based on the person aligning with who you are.”\\n   \\n      Who you are when you arrive in Cassadaga may or may not be who you are when you leave, said Jordan.\\n   \\n      While there’s no official camp count, she said an estimated 15,000 to 17,000 people visit Cassadaga every year – and they come from all over the world.\\n   \\n      “Often people come looking for guidance and healing and looking for closure to tragic situations,” she said. “I find that as we are able to share information about their loved ones, which we call evidential – which is to say enough information for them to say ‘that is my loved one’ – it’s truly amazing because they understand their loved ones are truly around them in spirit.”\\n   \\n      Whether to believe in what the Spiritualists are offering has been met with a range of responses since the movement took hold. The practices have been soundly rejected, wholeheartedly embraced and everything in between. And the present-day is no different.\\n   \\n      Felicitas Schroeder, a massage therapist from Lingen, Germany, is strolling along the Fairy Trail – one of a handful of pretty parks that’s lined with items people have left as offerings, ranging from statues of gnomes and butterflies to a couple of worse-for-the-weather My Little Ponies, a Barbie Dream House and a bottle of tea tree cleansing lotion.\\n   \\n      Schroeder’s on her second visit to Cassadaga with her 14-year-old daughter.\\n   \\n      “It’s a good feeling here, you must love it or not,” Schroeder said, adding that she doesn’t plan to visit a medium or have a tarot reading in the hotel. “If I was alone here, I would just sit and stay for hours.”\\n   \\n      At the site of a new stone waterfall under construction near the lakeshore in Seneca Park (a donation from a friend of the camp), three workers arranging Tennessee fieldstone note that the town has a peaceful feeling they didn’t expect. One said he often spots deer in the mornings.\\n   \\n      Lloyd Lightsey, 66, of The Pond Monster, the company building the water feature, said he’s lived in Florida since he was six and had always heard of Cassadaga – but only visited for the first time once the project got underway.\\n   \\n      A born-again Christian, he’d recently attended a service at Colby Memorial Temple, which dates to 1923 and where weekly Spiritualist services are held, and said it was like no spiritual experience he’d had before. “You’re not judged, it’s just an easy relaxed feeling,” he said.\\n   \\n      “I went in kind of like, ‘okay prove to me what you’re doing,’ ” Lightsey said about a Sunday afternoon Grove Service he later attended where mediums connect with people they choose from the crowd for an impromptu reading.\\n \\n      “My son and I did the readings and we both had somebody come through,” he said, recognizing his deceased father in the medium’s detailed description.\\n   \\n      For all the believers, of course, there are plenty of skeptics.\\n   \\n      At Colby-Alderman Park, an official county park just outside the camp’s borders, where signage tells the story of Spiritualism’s links to the area, a county worker who lives in nearby Lake Helen said she “thinks they do horoscopes” in Cassadaga but has never been and doesn’t plan to.\\n   \\n      Back along Stevens Street at the camp, 93-year-old Jerusalen Morales has brought her son and a family friend to visit the camp for their first time on what she said was probably her 50th visit to Cassadaga.\\n   \\n      Morales said she worked as a medium in Puerto Rico and New York before retiring to Florida and finds Cassadaga to be “a very spiritual and angelical place.”\\n   \\n      “People come here for the benefit of what they feel in the place,” she said.\\n   \\n      Her son, Ricardo Morales, visiting from New York, said there are certain places in the world where he’s felt his mind is open to things, mentioning Jerusalem’s Wailing Wall and St. Peter’s Basilica in Rome.\\n   \\n      “When you walk around Cassadaga there’s a sense of safety, healing and good,” he said.\\n   \\n      Sitting on a yellow swinging bench on the screened front porch of his 1906 home in the camp, Richard Russell\\xa0 — one of the camp’s mediums and healers — considers Cassadaga today.\\n   \\n      Russell, 79, first arrived in the camp in 1997 from New York after his life was up-ended during a stressful corporate career in the real estate industry.\\n   \\n      “This wasn’t my picture of spending my elderly years,” he said. His dog and cat, Harley and Leala, were at his side and a bumper sticker on the window behind him read, “If you lived in your heart you’d be home by now.”\\n   \\n      The RV he bought a few years back to explore Florida’s beauty sits parked outside and isn’t getting the miles he’d hoped because work and life have been too busy.\\n   \\n      “The public is still coming to Cassadaga, but we don’t have the supply of medium and healers to meet the demand,” Russell said.\\n   \\n      To become a certified medium and healer in the camp requires taking in-person courses in Cassadaga for between four and six years, with public demonstrations of your “gifts” as part of the requirements.\\n   \\n      “We get a lot of people interested but they don’t want to make the commitment,” Russell said.\\n   \\n      “For people who are really serious about serving the public they can make this their career,” he added, before answering a phone call from a regular client requesting a session.\\n   \\n      “Most of my business is referrals. If you don’t have the gift, people won’t come to you,” he said. “The camp takes it very seriously to weed out people who do not have any spiritual gifts.”\\n   \\n      Russell’s partner, the board of trustees member Deb Jordan, has been in Cassadaga since 2006 and said there’s a big misconception about the town and camp.\\n   \\n      “People think of Cassadaga as a spooky place or ghost town,” she said. “My experience as someone who works as a medium and with spirit, is that I find it to be a very sacred and beautiful place and experience here.”\\n   \\n      “Some people are afraid to come down the street; they think some spook is going to come out and grab them,” Russell said.\\n   \\n      The evenings leading up to Halloween each year fill with revelers by the hundreds, drawn mostly by the haunted attraction Hotel Cassadaga puts on (through Oct. 31 this year) and the outdoor tents that pop up to sell beer and food.\\n   \\n      But for the rest of the year, Cassadaga is quiet and peaceful, Russell said.\\n   \\n      “Most people don’t know the camp and Cassadaga even exist,” he said.\\xa0“The people that speak the worst about us have never been here.”\\n   \\nTerry Ward is a Florida-based travel writer and freelance journalist in Tampa who has visited Cassadaga several times.\\n',\n",

       " {'headline': '\\n      Why this American couple swapped California for Spain\\n    ',\n",
       "  'contents': ' \\n      After a number of failed IVF rounds, health issues and the death of their beloved dog, US couple Jason Luban and Selena Medlen were in need of a change of scenery.\\n   \\n      The couple, then based in Oakland, California, had penciled in a trip to Andalusia, Spain, months before, but were unsure whether to go ahead with it when the health of Luban, who has torsion dystonia, a rare movement disorder, began to deteriorate.\\n   \\n      “We were figuring out how to get him healthy again,” Medlen tells CNN Travel, before explaining that Luban was also grieving the loss of a friend and mentor. “So we had this vacation on the books, and we weren’t sure if he could travel.”\\n   \\n      According to Medlen, they ultimately decided to “go for it” after Luban, who suffers from insomnia, began sleeping better.\\n   \\n      “We thought, maybe we needed a break,” adds Medlen, who was working as an attorney at the time. “That if we could get away from everything, maybe he would start to feel better.”\\n   \\n      A friend had recommended that the pair, married since 2009, spend some time in Ronda, a town located in Spain’s Malaga province, so they decided to book two nights there.\\n   \\n      But neither could have predicted that they’d end up packing up their lives and relocating there just a few months later.\\n   \\n      In May 2016, they flew into Madrid, spending some time in the capital city, as well as Toledo, Cordoba and Seville, before heading to Ronda.\\n   \\n      “As we left Seville for Ronda, something shifted,” says Luban, an acupuncturist. “The land. The energy. “All [of] the plants were blooming.\\n   \\n      “There were all these colors everywhere. And we were both just in shock at how gorgeous it was as we kept climbing and climbing in the car.”\\n   \\n      When they reached the town, they were greeted by a parade, which set the tone for the rest of the weekend.\\n   \\n      The pair celebrated Medlen’s 38th birthday in Ronda, and say they were struck by how friendly everyone was.\\n   \\n      “Everything kind of came together for just a day or two while we were here,” says Luban, who is originally from Oregon while Medlen is from Texas.\\n   \\n      After wrapping up their time in the pretty town, they went on to visit Granada before returning to the US. But Ronda stayed with them.\\n   \\n      “We went back to our lives, which we realized really sucked compared to what our experience was here [in Ronda,]” admits Luban, before explaining that his insomnia returned once they were back in the US.\\n   \\n      “Also, we both had, unbeknownst to one another, looked in the windows of real estate offices to see what the rental prices were here [in Ronda]. And it was a tenth of what we were paying in California.”\\n   \\n      While lying on the couch one day and reflecting on their fertility struggles, they began discussing what they would want for their lives if they weren’t ever able to have children.\\n   \\n      “Selena said, ‘If we’re not going to have a kid, I want my life to be f**king fabulous,’” recalls Luban. “And we were like, ‘Okay, what does that look like?’”\\n   \\n      They decided that, for them, this would be having the opportunity to live in another country, experience a different culture and learn the language.\\n   \\n      And Spain was now right at the top of their list.\\n   \\n      After sitting down and working out the figures, the couple realized that it would be “affordable” for them to live in Ronda for a year, provided Luban sold his acupuncture practice in California, which he managed to do within six weeks.\\n   \\n      They then whittled down all of their belongings “from two cars and a full house to two suitcases a piece,” and booked an Airbnb in Ronda to stay in before they found something more long-term.\\n   \\n      The pair flew back to Madrid in September 2016.\\n   \\n      “Four months after we left Ronda, we were back to stay,” says Luban. “For what we thought would be a year.”\\n   \\n      But while the town had seemed like a magical place when they’d visited a few months before, it looked far less appealing when they returned shortly after Feria de Pedro Romero, a festival dedicated to bullfighting.\\n   \\n      “We arrived on a Sunday, so it was after the party,” explains Medlen. “Everything was closed.\\n   \\n      “The town was kind of dead and they had not had the opportunity to clean up [from the festival] yet. So it was a really different experience.”\\n   \\n      Luban jokes that they found themselves walking down the road with their suitcases thinking, “Oh my God, what did we do to our lives?”\\n   \\n      Although they’d previously been told that they’d have plenty of options for long-term rentals once they were in Ronda, this turned out not to be the case, and they struggled to find somewhere suitable at first.\\n   \\n      The prices were also slightly higher than they’d estimated, although still more affordable than what they’d been paying in California.\\n   \\n      Despite these initial setbacks, the couple persevered and soon found an apartment. They went on to join a language school in order to learn Spanish, and say that this proved to be a massive turning point for them.\\n   \\n      “It’s probably the reason we stayed,” admits Medlen. “Because it was such a great place for forming community.”\\n   \\n      They began going to various classes four times a week, and were able to meet other expats and discuss their experiences with them, which helped them through the process tremendously.\\n   \\n      “Nobody in the US could relate to what we were doing,” explains Luban. “They all thought it was a great idea until we were going to do it. Then they were like, ‘What are you doing?’”\\n   \\n      As Luban has dual US-German citizenship, he didn’t need a visa to live in Spain. However, Medlen was required to obtain a residence permit.\\n   \\n      While they adapted to the Spanish lifestyle quickly, there were some aspects that they found difficult to get used to.\\n   \\n      “I think we struggled with the siesta concept,” admits Medlen. “We’d be gung-ho to get a bunch of things done, and we’d run into town to do those mundane tasks that we all have to do.\\n   \\n      “But everything’s closed between two and five. So you pretty much can’t do anything.”\\n   \\n      The pair admit that it took them some time to transition from being around expats constantly, to integrating within the Spanish community, and say that this is something that they’re still navigating.\\n   \\n      However, Luban emotionally recalls how the importance of this connection really hit home when he ended up in hospital after a bike accident last year and underwent emergency surgery.\\n   \\n      “It would have been a completely different and much less pleasant experience if we didn’t know people who happen to be nurses and knew the whole community,” Luban explains.\\n   \\n      “Whereas when we first got here, we weren’t part of that community. But we thought we were having our Spain experience with expats.”\\n   \\n      While the couple have private medical insurance, Luban was initially admitted to a public hospital, which wasn’t covered under their policy.\\n   \\n      “Being Americans, we thought, ‘This could ruin us. There goes Spain.’” admits Luban. “The next day, when I was released after I’d had surgery, a night there, my own room and two ambulance rides. They said, ‘Well, we need you to pay the bill. It’s 1,380 euros.’”\\n   \\n      He was particularly moved by the kindness shown by the local community, who dropped off food and constantly checked up on both of them.\\n   \\n      “In America, people would text you gift certificates and sad faces on the phone,” says Luban.\\n   \\n      “Here, people literally showed up at the door when Selena would be coming back from the hospital to give her a hug and tell her that they were going to be there. And they were there. For weeks.”\\n   \\n      While they’d initially planned to stay in Spain for a year, Luban and Medlen chose to extend their stay beyond this.\\n   \\n      The couple admit that watching Donald Trump being elected as president of the United States in November 2016 contributed to their decision to remain in Spain.\\n   \\n      “Once that happened, within a couple of months, our families were saying, ‘Don’t come back,’” says Luban, explaining that their relatives had been eager for them to return before the election result.\\n   \\n      “‘This country is changing. You really should just enjoy yourselves and not get caught up in all of the division that’s happening in the United States.’ That was just two months in.”\\n   \\n      Medlen points out that they both worked constantly while they were in the US, and felt as though they rarely got to spend time together, whereas they’ve been able to enjoy each other’s company a great deal more while living in Spain.\\n   \\n      Meanwhile, Luban’s health has improved during their time there, and he regularly rides with various local cycling groups. However, he says that he’s had his ups and downs “sleep-wise.”\\n   \\n      “The biggest thing is that we can manage our stress much better here,” he says. “When we’re not constantly worrying about our safety, money or whatever.”\\n   \\n      As they only had enough funds to cover a year living in Spain without working, the couple needed to start earning money again in order to extend their time there.\\n   \\n      Fortunately, Medlen was able to take on remote work for law firms in the US and Luban launched a website advising other practitioners on how to sell a medical practice.\\n   \\n      “I’d say we spend one fifth of what we would on food here, rather than California,” Luban estimates. “One eighth to one tenth on our living expenses. One eighth on health care.\\n   \\n      “And we had no idea how much your quality of life goes up when you’re not trying to meet all of those bills.”\\n   \\n      They both try to work around 20 hours a week, and say they’ve been able to live comfortably this way because their money goes much further in Spain.\\n   \\n      “We also have more time to cook, which brings your food bills down because you’re not buying takeout,” adds Medlen. “And we have more time to exercise. So I feel like we’re healthier.”\\n   \\n      Seven years after relocating to Ronda, the couple are very much settled, and even have a dog, named Lola Supernova.\\n   \\n      They say that they re-evaluate their decision each year, and weigh up whether they want to stay in Spain or move on.\\n   \\n      However, they’ve chosen not to buy a home there so that they have a little more freedom.\\n   \\n      “Wa take it to one year increments,” explains Medlen. “And we still rent our apartment that we live in.\\n   \\n      “We want to keep things simple and have flexibility so that we could change our minds and go somewhere else.”\\n   \\n      They return to the US every year and joke that they’re always shocked by how much a burrito at American food chain Chipotle is.\\n   \\n      “There’s been a lot of inflation since we left,” notes Medlen.\\n   \\n      While the couple still sometimes struggle with the prospect of not having children, Luban, now 53, says they feel “too old now,” adding that while they previously looked into adoption “the process seemed to be a nightmare, financially and otherwise.”\\n   \\n      “And it was such an emotionally (and financially) painful experience to try and fail, we couldn’t go through it again,” he adds, stressing that they have “no regrets.”\\n   \\n      “So we decided instead that we’d make our lives as interesting as possible.”\\n   \\n      Both acknowledge that one of the downsides of living in a different country for so long is that they don’t necessarily feel they belong anywhere.\\n   \\n      “We may never feel entirely at home in the US again, and we will never be truly accepted as Spanish,” admits Luban, noting that a “great way to learn about your country is to leave it.”\\n   \\n      “But Andalusia has taken us in, cared for us in a way we never could have imagined. Like interest on a bank account we never knew we had.”\\n  ',\n",

       " {'headline': '\\n      Two strangers moved into an apartment in Prague. Then they fell in love\\n    ',\n",
       "  'contents': ' \\n      Mandy Sanchez was sitting in her bedroom in Texas when she saw the listing.\\n   \\n      A spacious room in an Art Nouveau building in the buzzy Vinohrady neighborhood, near the city’s Riegrovy Sady park, known for its beautiful sunsets.\\n   \\n      It was December 2019. Mandy was a 22-year-old about to graduate Texas A&M University. She was planning to move to Prague to teach English.\\n   \\n      She’d joined a Facebook group called “Flatshare in Prague”, hoping to find somewhere to live. The Vinohrady room was advertised by a Facebook user called Marcus Wecksten. Alongside photos of the apartment, Marcus wrote that the current inhabitants were two guys – one Finnish (Marcus) and one German (his roommate, Boris). Marcus and Boris were both students in Prague and were looking for someone to move in ASAP.\\n   \\n      Mandy thought the apartment looked perfect: great neighborhood, nice-looking space – and the room was within her budget. It was almost too good to be true. She fired off a message right away, expressing her interest.\\n   \\n      Marcus was studying in his bedroom in the Prague apartment when Mandy’s message popped up on his laptop.\\n   \\n      “Sounds great,” he said. “Can you come by sometime next week for a viewing?”\\n   \\n      “I’m in Texas,” explained Mandy. “I’m moving to Prague in January.”\\n   \\n      Marcus considered this. They wouldn’t be able to meet Mandy before she signed the lease, which wasn’t ideal. He wrote back to Mandy, apologizing, explaining it wouldn’t work out.\\n   \\n      But Mandy was determined. “We could Skype?” she suggested. “I really want this room.”\\n   \\n      Marcus – who, back then, was 25 and midway through a medical degree at Prague’s Charles University – had met his roommate Boris at college. The two had lived in the Vinohrady apartment for a couple of years.\\n   \\n      “It was a super-nice apartment in one of the coolest neighborhoods in Prague,” Marcus tells CNN Travel.\\n \\n      A revolving door of fellow students had rented the third room over the years.\\n   \\n      “We were looking for somebody social, who wanted to hang out with us in the communal space, in the living room – that’s where we spent quite a bit of time,” Marcus recalls. “I don’t know what the other requirements were, but probably the basic ones – somebody clean…”\\n   \\n      In the subsequent Skype interview, Mandy recalls Boris being particularly concerned about her potential cleanliness.\\n   \\n      “He asked a lot about if I would help out with the cleaning,” she says. “But I was the one who was more worried about, ‘Are they going to be clean?’ Because it’s two guys…”\\n   \\n      Shared standards of cleanliness confirmed, Mandy, Marcus and Boris spent much of the Skype call talking about the Vinohrady neighborhood and the nearby amenities. Towards the end, they segued into chatting about themselves.\\n   \\n      “I thought that it was super-interesting that Mandy was from Texas,” says Marcus. “I had never met a Texan in my life. I had this stereotypical picture of a Texan in a cowboy hat and boots and a revolver.”\\n   \\n      For her part, Mandy hung up the call with the impression Marcus and Boris were friendly and “normal.”\\n   \\n      “I hung up and basically was like, ‘Okay, they’re not going to murder me. They seem like nice people. I probably could enter their apartment and we would be okay.’”\\n   \\n      After a follow-up call to iron out details, Marcus and Boris offered Mandy the room. By coincidence, this message arrived on the day of Mandy’s college graduation.\\n   \\n      Midway through celebrating her graduation, Mandy filled in her parents and sister on her new home. She extolled its virtues – amazing location, great-looking building, and mentioned in passing that the roommates were two guys who were medical students.\\n   \\n      “My parents were like, ‘We hope you don’t fall in love with either of them, because if you do, that means you’re going to live in Europe forever,’” Mandy recalls.\\n   \\n      “I was like, ‘Why would that be the case?’ And they said, ‘Well, because they’re going to be getting medically licensed in Europe, and then that’s not going to transfer easily to the US. So, if you fall in love with one of them, you’re staying there forever.’”\\n   \\n      Her parents were speaking in jest – at least in part. But Mandy cut through their teasing tone, wanting to set the record straight.\\n   \\n      “That is not what I’m going to Europe for,” she said.\\n   \\n      And it was true.\\n   \\n      “I wasn’t moving there to fall in love,” says Mandy today.\\n   \\n      But the universe had other ideas.\\n   \\n      Mandy had never been to Prague before. She’d scrolled through photos online and marveled at how beautiful it looked. She’d got tips from friends who’d visited and fallen in love with the city. She’d started to imagine herself living in the apartment in Vinohrady.\\n   \\n      But none of this could prepare her for the whirlwind of her arrival day.\\n   \\n      “I don’t really think I was thinking – it was just all happening,” Mandy recalls.\\n   \\n      She remembers getting into an Uber at the airport and peering out the window. It was only 5:30 p.m., but it was already pitch black outside. As she got closer to the city, the spires of Prague Castle were illuminated. Mandy felt a mixture of exhaustion, excitement and disbelief that this new stage of her life had started.\\n   \\n      Meanwhile, Marcus and Boris had spent most of that day deep-cleaning their apartment.\\n   \\n      “We were cleaning corners of the apartment that hadn’t been cleaned in a long time,” says Marcus. “We wanted to make a good impression on Mandy.”\\n   \\n      Marcus had just taken out the last trash bag and dumped it in the communal bins when Mandy’s Uber pulled up in front of the building.\\n   \\n      “She gets out, the driver helped her with her bags,” Marcus recalls. “My first impression is that she’s super-cute. She’s tiny, but she seems to have a lot of energy and she’s very cute.”\\n   \\n      Mandy smiled as the Uber drove away.\\n   \\n      “Oh, you must be Marcus,” she said.\\n   \\n      Marcus reached out his hand for Mandy to shake. The moment was a little awkward, but friendly.\\n   \\n      Then, Marcus took Mandy’s bags and carried them up the stairs.\\n   \\n      “I was like, ‘Oh, that’s very nice that he took my bags. Duly noted,’” recalls Mandy.\\n   \\n      Inside the new apartment, Mandy met Boris and offered to treat her new roommates to take-out.\\n   \\n      The next thing she knew, Marcus was putting through a pizza order on his laptop.\\n   \\n      “I had to awkwardly hand him my credit card,” says Mandy “He’s typing in the details. And then, Google Chrome asks if he wants to save the card. And I was like, ‘You better not save that card information.’”\\n   \\n      Mandy was only half-joking. She recalls thinking: “This is kind of weird. I just met this guy. And I’m giving him my credit card information.”\\n   \\n      For the next couple of hours, Mandy, Marcus and Boris sat around eating pizza and chatting.\\n   \\n      Mandy appreciated how welcoming her new roommates were. And she thought Marcus was “cute.”\\n   \\n      “But also I was tired,” she says. “I was like, ‘Maybe I’m delusional.’”\\n   \\n      After dinner, Mandy, exhausted from the flight, decamped to her bedroom and went to sleep. She woke up wondering if she’d still find Marcus attractive after sleeping off the jet lag. Her question was answered as soon as she saw him in the kitchen, smiling at her.\\n   \\n      Over the next week, Mandy and Marcus got to know each other. They ate dinner out most nights – just the two of them. Boris was always invited, but often had plans and couldn’t join.\\n   \\n      Mandy says she and Marcus “clicked right away.”\\n   \\n      “There was a lot of chemistry between us. But it was chemistry that you’re not sure what you should do with,” she says.\\n   \\n      Mandy was conscious they’d just moved in together – she didn’t want to halt a potential friendship or upset their living situation.\\n   \\n      But Marcus didn’t quite have the same reservations about potentially dating his roommate.\\n   \\n      “I was probably more riding the wave of what was happening,” he says. “I didn’t really think about the potential consequences so much, I was more like, ‘Feels good. Let’s go for it.’”\\n   \\n      Despite Mandy’s hesitations, she and Marcus grew closer and closer. Mandy couldn’t deny what she calls “the immediacy of the draw we had to each other.”\\n   \\n      Before long, they were dating in all but name. They went out to dinner together, explored Prague side by side, and spent hours talking together in the apartment. They traveled out of Prague to the Pilsner Brewery together, enjoying a tour and spending the evening sharing beers. On Valentine’s Day, around a month after she’d moved in, Marcus cooked for Mandy. Boris walked in and raised an eyebrow at the obvious romantic undertones.\\n   \\n      But all the while Mandy and Marcus grew closer, the shadow of coronavirus was becoming harder to ignore. When Mandy arrived in Europe, the pandemic was a distant rumbling of thunder. By early March, the storm had broken over Europe.\\n   \\n      Mandy woke up one morning to an email from her parents. The US border was closing. They’d bought her a plane ticket home.\\n   \\n      “Here’s your plane ticket, it leaves on Thursday, and we have 24 hours to cancel it. So it’s fully refundable,” read the email. “You’re an adult, you can make your own decisions. But we would really like you to come home.”\\n   \\n      Mandy wasn’t sure what to do. If she left, her visa would be nulled and it wouldn’t be easy for her to come back. Her burgeoning connection with Marcus would end before it had even begun.\\n   \\n      But on the flip side, this was a global crisis. Surely it made sense to be with her loved ones in her home country? If she stayed, would she be stuck in Prague indefinitely?\\n   \\n      “I think I’m falling in love,” Mandy thought. “I don’t want this to end. But I also don’t know if this is a mistake not to go home.”\\n   \\n      Boris had already returned to Germany. But Marcus wasn’t sure if he would go back to Finland. He hadn’t spoken the words aloud, but it seemed like he was waiting to see what Mandy would do.\\n   \\n      Over the next 24 hours Mandy flip-flopped between staying and going. Eventually, she and Marcus talked through their options together.\\n   \\n      “We didn’t go out and say, ‘Hey, we will fight through this Covid together, united,’” says Marcus. “It was more carefully trying to pique each other’s interest.”\\n   \\n      “If you stay, I’ll stay,” Mandy and Marcus eventually decided.\\n   \\n      “Once we had decided that we would both stay, it felt very exciting for me,” says Marcus.\\n   \\n      Over the next few months, as Prague descended into a strict lockdown, Mandy and Marcus were together pretty much 24/7.\\n   \\n      Marcus started experimenting with cooking elaborate meals. Mandy would sit on the couch, drinking wine, cheering him on and keeping him company.\\n   \\n      The two spent long evenings sharing stories and talking about their lives.\\n   \\n      “We grew much closer and developed much stronger feelings for each other,” says Marcus. “We spent so much time together, just the two of us and got to open up about stuff.”\\n   \\n      For Marcus, the more introverted of the pair, spending time with Mandy at home was the ideal way to get to know her properly.\\n   \\n      “I felt quite comfortable and safe in that home environment,” he says. “So I felt like I could be myself. And also with Mandy – just her personality meant it was very easy to be myself.”\\n   \\n      Mandy found it harder to be in the moment. She loved spending time with Marcus, but she couldn’t help but worry about the potential future complications of dating someone from a different country.\\n   \\n      She also struggled not to let the grim realities of the pandemic infiltrate their bubble.\\n   \\n      “Everything was still quite up in the air,” she recalls. “We hadn’t defined the relationship, but I stayed for this man, basically. And I’ve just moved here, and I’m still under a visa process that’s ongoing, and the world is up in flames and all of these things…So it wasn’t necessarily like, ‘Oh, I feel safe and at home with you.’ It was pretty hectic for me still.”\\n   \\n      Despite this, Mandy recalls many bright spots.\\n   \\n      “We spent a lot of time in the park, drinking prosecco and having a grand old time,” she says.\\n   \\n      Prague, usually packed with tourists, was sleepy and empty.\\n   \\n      Mandy and Marcus recall “walking on the Charles Bridge, and absolutely no one was there.”\\n   \\n      Despite the grim circumstances, the empty city “was pretty cool.”\\n   \\n      Summer rolled around, Prague’s pandemic restrictions eased a little. Marcus was set to head back to Finland for his summer vacation to work. He was set to be away from the Czech Republic for three months.\\n   \\n      “The night before he left, I’m crying and I’m like, ‘Oh, gosh, you’re leaving and I’m so sad,’” recalls Mandy.\\n   \\n      That was the moment Mandy and Marcus finally spoke their feelings aloud – and confirmed they were committed to being together.\\n   \\n      During their three months apart, Mandy and Marcus only grew more certain of this fact. Mandy recalls phoning her mother, telling her she knew she was in love with Marcus and she hoped he felt the same way.\\n   \\n      When Marcus returned to the apartment in Vinohrady, he told Mandy he was in love with her.\\n   \\n      “Thank goodness,” said Mandy, laughing.\\n   \\n      It was then that she finally let herself relax into this new reality. Marcus was her boyfriend, and despite the stresses that defined 2020, Mandy was happy. She loved living in Prague. She decided to extend her time there, using the pandemic as an excuse – pretty much all her teaching had taken place online, after all, she hadn’t really had the experience she’d planned.\\n   \\n      Whenever she was asked, Mandy was vague about how much longer she’d stay.\\n   \\n      “It was always, ‘A while longer,’” says Mandy. “Never really a defined end.”\\n   \\n      Boris returned to Prague, bemused by how Marcus and Mandy’s relationship had grown in his absence. He was happy for them.\\n   \\n      “I left Mandy and Marcus as two new roommates and met them again when I came back as a well established couple with their own traditions and habits,” Boris tells CNN Travel. “It was a very cute situation to witness.”\\n   \\n      The following summer, in July 2021, Mandy traveled with Marcus to Finland to spend time with his friends and family and get a glimpse into his culture and country.\\n   \\n      “Introducing Mandy to my friends felt really great,” recalls Marcus. “She seemed to click with everyone.”\\n   \\n      “Meeting his family and coming to Finland was that final puzzle piece for me,” says Mandy.\\n   \\n      When the US borders reopened later that year, Marcus traveled with Mandy to Texas to meet Mandy’s loved ones.\\n   \\n      “Her parents and sister, they were all super-embracing and I really felt like I was part of the family from the get-go,” says Marcus.\\n   \\n      After those important introductions, “we felt it was getting more serious,” says Mandy.\\n   \\n      But Mandy and Marcus’ future still felt like it came with a lot of question marks. If they stayed together, where would they live? Mandy’s parents’ initial tongue-in-cheek comments about marrying her medical student roommates still stood – Marcus wouldn’t be able to practice medicine in the US, so living there seemed out of the question.\\n   \\n      During this time, Marcus and Mandy decided to go to couples therapy, figuring it was important to talk through some of these uncertainties.\\n   \\n      “I think that was really helpful for us in terms of – there’s so many things to think about with an intercultural relationship – where we’re going to live and all of these really heavy questions,” says Mandy.\\n   \\n      “We had a really great therapist in Prague, and that really helped us to feel a lot more serious and have a very solid foundation.”\\n   \\n      The couple confirmed they “saw life together” and decided it was OK to just “try to figure it out step by step.”\\n   \\n      “We feel very secure,” says Marcus. “We know that it’s going to be the two of us going forward.”\\n   \\n      Cut to spring 2023, three years since Mandy moved to Prague, and three years since she met Marcus.\\n   \\n      The couple were starting to suspect they’d have to leave the city they both loved. Marcus was about to graduate medical school, and it was looking like it would be easier for him to get a job in Finland.\\n   \\n      To mark three years together, Marcus decided to surprise Mandy with a photoshoot – he figured they’d both appreciate having some nice photos at some of their favorite Prague spots.\\n   \\n      The couple, photographer in tow, headed to a park where the trees were covered in pastel-colored blossoms. Mandy had long been obsessed with the blooming spring trees, she’d never seen anything like them in Texas.\\n   \\n      As the photographer took a couple of preliminary photographs of Mandy, Marcus seized the moment. He knelt behind her. When Mandy turned around, she was initially confused. Then it twigged – he was proposing.\\n   \\n      The subsequent photos captured Mandy’s pure delight. In fact, in all the photos taken that day, Mandy and Marcus are glowing with happiness.\\n   \\n      The shoot concluded on the Charles Bridge. As Mandy and Marcus stood there, looking out over the city arm in arm, Mandy suggested they should celebrate at their favorite restaurant.\\n   \\n      “Well, it depends on how long it takes you to pack,” said Marcus.\\n   \\n      “He’d planned a night or two at a spa hotel in Karlovy Vary, which is a spa town two hours outside of Prague,” explains Mandy.\\n   \\n      The couple spent the rest of the weekend toasting their future.\\n   \\n      This past summer, Marcus and Mandy left Prague and moved to Helsinki, Finland. It was bittersweet saying goodbye to the city that shaped their relationship, but the couple are excited for this next chapter, and plan to stay in Helsinki for the next couple of years.\\n   \\n      Mandy and Marcus will return to Prague next spring for their wedding – a weekend celebration in which friends and family from across the globe, including, of course, their former roommate Boris, will convene in the Czech Republic to celebrate Mandy and Marcus’ love story.\\n   \\n      On their wedding website, Marcus and Mandy listed some of their favorite places in Prague for guests unfamiliar with the city. They eschewed the obvious spots – they’re available for anyone to Google – in favor of the local haunts they loved. Naturally, the Vinohrady apartment is top of that list.\\n   \\n      Marcus and Mandy look back at their time there very fondly. Marcus marvels at the “small, tiny events” that lead them to cross paths, live in that apartment together and fall in love.\\n   \\n      Mandy expresses “how absolutely joyful, smitten, and thankful we are that we allowed ourselves the joy of loving each other – even when we weren’t sure how things would turn out.”\\n   \\n      “We’ve experienced quite a bit in these few years together and are so happy that we get to continue going through life together,” Mandy says. “It’s been the greatest and most unexpected adventure.”\\n  ',\n",

       "  'contents': ' \\n“Oppenheimer” may have given the Trinity Site a boost of fame this summer, but for many history buffs, making a pilgrimage to the area is a journey years in the making.\\n   \\n      Nearly 4,000 people flocked to the Trinity Site this past Saturday, according to the White Sand Missile Range Public Affairs Office, waiting hours to visit the infamous ground zero, where the first atomic bomb was detonated.\\n   \\n      David Tise, a 33-year-old National Park Service Ranger at Carlsbad Caverns in New Mexico and a self-described “historical nutcase,” took Friday off work to make the 2.5-hour drive to Alamogordo, New Mexico. He then woke up at 5:30 a.m. and made the two-hour drive to the site, where he then waited in line for about 90 minutes. In total, that’s about six hours — all just to see the Trinity Site, a goal he’s had for years.\\n   \\n      “The thing that stood out the most was how isolated it was,” Tise told CNN. “Even back then, how they transported everything for the test from Los Alamos without anyone noticing.”\\n   \\n      The Trinity Site only opens to the public twice a year, on the first Saturday in April and the third Saturday in October, said Drew Hamilton, a spokesperson with the White Sand Missile Range Public Affairs Office.\\n   \\n      Because of the success of the “Oppenheimer” movie, which tells the story of J. Robert Oppenheimer and the Manhattan Project, staff were expecting closer to 5,000 visitors this year, Hamilton said. Still, 4,000 is “on the higher end,” he said, a trend he expects to continue for next year’s April opening.\\n   \\n      Tise, who completed his first visit this year, called the experience “sobering.”\\n   \\n      “The Trinity test helped win World War II and saved countless American lives. However, the area is still a little radioactive and the test destroyed the environment for years after,” he said. “I’m not a warmonger or anything but I don’t think anyone should have that much power to destroy the world.”\\n   \\n      Zach Berkowitz, an 18-year-old high school student from Colorado, also had a long journey to see the site. Berkowitz and his father woke up at 5:15 a.m. on Saturday and drove an hour from their hotel to the Trinity Site, where they then waited almost two hours just to enter.\\n   \\n      Berkowitz is interested in nuclear history and has wanted to see the site for years, he said. But his dad needed convincing — only agreeing to do the drive after seeing “Oppenheimer.”\\n   \\n      “Seeing the pieces of trinitite on the ground was really interesting, since it really made it clear that I was standing somewhere special,” Berkowtiz said.\\n   \\n      Trinitite, the glass-like chunks that appeared on the desert floor following the Trinity explosion, are illegal to collect due to concerns of radioactivity. Based on what other people’s Geiger counters detected, the trinitite was more radioactive than Berkowitz had expected, he said. He tried to pick one up, but was told not to by an Army member.\\n   \\n      “If I could have taken a piece home, I would have,” he said. “But doing so is illegal.”\\n   \\n      Though this year’s opening doesn’t quite beat the record for visitors – that would be 2015’s 70th anniversary, for which more than 5,000 people made the trek — this year’s event still attracted the usual “wide array of visitors,” Hamilton said, “from those who just happened to be stopping by to those that had planned entire vacations around making it out.”\\n   \\n      “Everybody that’s there is excited to be there, just because we don’t open the site up so often, so it is kind of a treat,” he said. “And the majority of visitors are history buffs anyway. So getting out and being able to go to a site that isn’t open very often, and is such a significant historical point on the globe, is a real fun thing for them.”\\n  ',\n",

Designated a “4E\\xa0airport,” it can accommodate larger commercial planes, including many of those used on global long-haul routes.\\n   \\n      Construction began in 2020, with the airport design reportedly inspired by the traditional Cambodian architecture style. The official airport website offers minimal information on available services, shops and restaurants at the new facility, however, it does provide a full schedule of departing and arriving flights.\\n   \\n      Recent data released by Cambodia’s Ministry of Tourism reveals the country received 3.5 million international tourists in the first eight months of 2023.\\n   \\n      That’s an increase of 250.8% over the same period last year, but a decrease of 19.7% over 2019, before the country closed its borders because of the pandemic.

       " {'headline': '\\n      A doping free-for-all Enhanced Games calls itself the answer to doping in sports. Opponents say it poses a danger to health\\n    ',\n",
       "  'contents': ' \\n      The 2024 Olympics are fast approaching and as athletes gear up for one of the world’s most prestigious sporting events, one entrepreneur has a different idea of what “faster, higher, stronger” – the former motto of the Games – might represent.\\n   \\n      The Enhanced Games says it is an “alternative” to what it calls the “corrupt Olympics Games.”\\n   \\n      Athletes competing at the Enhanced Games will be free to use performance-enhancing drugs, they won’t be tested and will be under no obligation to declare which substances they have taken in order to compete.\\n   \\n      That’s quite a contrast to the Olympics’ doping protocols. The International Testing Agency (ITA) will be responsible for looking after Paris 2024’s anti-doping program. Six years ago, the International Olympic Committee (IOC), which oversees the Olympics, delegated its entire clean sport program to the ITA. However, historically the Olympic Games have been dogged by a series of doping and kickback scandals.\\n   \\n      When approached for comment on the Enhanced Games and allegations of corruption, the IOC told CNN Sport that “the idea does not merit any comment.”\\n   \\n      CNN Sport interviewed a number of experts in the field of doping for this story, who expressed concern that the Enhanced Games was an extremely dangerous proposition.\\n   \\nDr. Grigory Rodchenkov, who exposed Russia’s state-sponsored doping program – a massive, years-long effort which benefited more than 1,000 athletes between 2011 and 2015 – said that the Enhanced Games is a “danger to health, to sport.”\\n   \\n      Whether the Enhanced Games will ever take place remains an open question, but the very idea is drawing considerable blowback from leading anti-doping officials and sporting organizations.\\n   \\n      The Enhanced Games is the brainchild of businessman Aron D’Souza. He is also the founding editor of “The Journal Jurisprudence,” a quarterly publication on legal philosophy, according to his website, which also describes him as an “avid athlete.”\\n   \\n      Recently, D’Souza told CNN Sport he has “signed term sheets with prominent venture capital firms” in relation to the Enhanced Games and is “waiting on the lawyers to finish long-form drafting.” He also said that a funding announcement is planned for early December.\\n   \\n      Although not legally binding, term sheets are a serious expression of intent by both sides, setting out the broad principles of an agreement.\\n   \\n      D’Souza believes what he calls a “science-driven” competition is the next step in the evolution of sport, suggesting that the absence of drug testing will level the playing field.\\n   \\n      While data from the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) suggests that less than 2% of athletes dope, Raphael Faiss, Research Manager at the centre of Research and Expertise in anti-doping sciences at the University of Lausanne, told CNN Sport that the number of athletes taking performance-enhancing drugs is likely significantly higher; his research suggests the figure could be between 15 to 18%.\\n   \\n      Faiss and his team compared athletes’ blood results collected by WADA-accredited labs to values from healthy adults, as well as doped and undoped athletes; the closer the values are to those of subjects to whom erythropoietin (EPO, which is used in blood doping) had been administered, the higher the chances that they’re actually doping.\\n   \\n      This analysis, Faiss said, is not proof of doping, but is a “robust way” of analyzing the data, allowing scientists to make an estimate for doping prevalence, as well as targeting athletes most likely to be doping.\\n   \\n      In written comments to CNN Sport, WADA said: “Determining the level of [doping] prevalence is a priority for WADA and something that is being addressed,” explaining that, since 2017, a “prevalence working group” has been established to “determine if strategies, reliable methods and tools can be developed to adequately assess the prevalence of doping in sports.”\\n   \\n      WADA told CNN Sport that the group has delivered “several recommendations and guidance to WADA but not the final ones yet.”\\n   \\n      WADA has reservations about Faiss’ study and pointed to the “complexity of trying to measure [doping] prevalence,” highlighting that reports have “greatly varying results.”\\n   \\n      The anti-doping organization added: “No single method will give a definitive prevalence figure for doping in all sports or even a single discipline.”\\n   \\nEditor’s note: You can find WADA’s full statement at the bottom of this article.\\xa0\\n \\n      Travis Tygart, the Chief Executive Officer at the United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA), told CNN Sport that the idea of an Enhanced Games is “farcical … likely illegal in many [US] states” and “a dangerous clown show, not real sport.”\\n   \\n      Substances such as anabolic steroids – which help to build muscle mass by enabling athletes to train harder and recover quickly from strenuous workouts – are classified as a Schedule III drug by the US Drug Enforcement Administration.\\n   \\n      When asked whether anabolic steroids will be allowed at the games and whether athletes would be tested for illegal drugs such as cocaine, D’Souza told CNN Sport that “we will not be drug testing at the games.”\\n   \\n      He added: “We do not propose to regulate what athletes use.”\\n   \\n      Anabolic steroids may be prescribed by a licensed physician for the treatment of certain conditions such as testosterone deficiency, but if used in the US without a prescription from a licensed physician, a first conviction could result in a one-year prison sentence and a $1,000 fine.\\n   \\n      But that isn’t the only potential legal jeopardy the Enhanced Games faces, according to American lawyer Jim Walden, who represents Russian whistleblower Grigory Rodchenkov.\\n   \\n      “If you look at the Enhanced Games website, it’s almost as though they’re advertising their disregard of the law,” Walden told CNN Sport.\\n   \\n      “They wrap themselves up in what I will call the cloak of legitimacy by using phrases like body autonomy and coming out as an enhanced athlete.\\n   \\n      “I hope they’re thinking hard about how they’re going to pull this off in the world in which the FBI has a specific unit that is called the Sports and Gaming Initiative that’s focusing on these very issues.”\\n   \\n      The Sports and Gaming Initiative was developed to “protect athletes and sporting institutions in the United States from criminal threats and influences,” according to the government website.\\n   \\n      The initiative works in partnership with sports leagues and governing bodies, international law enforcement and independent watchdog groups to tackle crimes such as fraud, doping and match-fixing;

If he had wanted to make more money, he says he’d continue to be a “quiet, mild-mannered venture capitalist.”\\n   \\n      “I do think fundamentally that consumers want this [the Enhanced Games] and athletes want this because if you go to the cinemas, no one’s interested in histories in the past anymore,” said D’Souza.\\n   \\n      “They’re interested in superheroes and technology in the future. And this is literally what we are bringing to a reality.”\\n   \\n      According to Pierre de Coubertin – the founder of the modern Olympics – “for every man, woman and child, it [sport] offers an opportunity for self-improvement.”\\n   \\n      Except historically, many athletes competing in the Olympics have taken the idea of self-improvement too far, notably at London 2012, which Rodchenkov has previously called “the dirtiest Olympics in history.”\\n   \\n      When the ITA concluded its re-analysis program for the London Games, it found 73 anti-doping rule violations, which led to the withdrawal of 31 medals and reallocation of 46 Olympic medals across the sports of athletics, weightlifting, wrestling and canoeing.\\n   \\n      Doping has been an issue at the Olympics throughout the event’s history, and the 100-meter final at the 1988 Games has become one of the most infamous and controversial moments in sporting history.\\n   \\n      Six of the eight finalists – notably the winner, Ben Johnson – who lined up on that September day in Seoul 35 years ago would fail drug tests themselves or be implicated in drug use during their careers.\\n   \\n      Despite some athletes continuing to cheat, global antidoping efforts remain ever-present, according to the testers.\\n   \\n      Recent out-of-competition (OOC) testing data published by the Athletics Integrity Unit (AIU) highlights positive results from steps being taken to keep “elite podiums and finals clean,” according to the anti-doping organization.\\n   \\n      Data focused on OOC testing ahead of last year’s World Athletics Championships in Eugene, Oregon, shows how resources and testing are targeting those athletes most likely to win medals and make finals.\\n   \\n      Whilst only 39% of the athletes in Eugene had three or more OOC tests in the 10 months leading up the event, 81% of top-eight finishers had three or more OOC tests.\\n   \\n      Yet the cat and mouse game between testers and athletes using banned substances continues.\\n   \\n      “It’s mostly about the question of timing and targeting the right athletes,” said Faiss.\\n   \\n      Given that athletes have their blood values regularly monitored, it is “getting more difficult for athletes to use high doses [of drugs such as EPO], but they would still be using micro dosing.”\\n   \\n      By taking EPO late at night and drinking enough water, the substance would not be detected in athletes the following morning, according to Faiss, though athletes suspected of blood doping could be tested in the middle of the night.\\n   \\n      “Athletes are actually getting back to very simple ways of doping with steroids,” he said, adding that “EPO is quite simple to use, but still tricky to detect.”\\n   \\n      Athletes “use the drugs that are actively working.”\\n   \\n      When it comes to new substances such as Roxadustat – the drug that two-time grand slam champion Simona Halep has recently been given a four-year ban for taking, although she denies ever knowingly or intentionally taking any prohibited substance – Faiss said athletes “are likely to use substances with a very short half-life in [the] body that are mimicking processes of the oxygen carrying improvements through the EPO channels.”\\n   \\n      Roxadustat has an elimination half-life of 10-16 hours, according to the National Institutes of Health.\\n   \\n      Athletes are “seeking to find substances where the [half-life] time window is very short, to make sure that if they are not tested at the right moment, they won’t be caught,” said Faiss.\\n   \\n      Michele Verroken, the founding director of consultancy group Sporting Integrity, believes an antidoping system is required that will “give a lot more credibility, a lot more immediacy to verifying results, if we’re going to keep the hearts and minds of athletes.”\\n   \\n      Verroken also questions what’s stopping an athlete from cheating if they only get caught 10 years after the event, or not at all. Under the World Anti-Doping Code, there is a 10-year statute of limitations on samples taken from 2015 onwards.\\n   \\n      Verroken told CNN Sport that the Enhanced Games is “setting a really interesting challenge for sporting competition.”\\n   \\n      Not unsurprisingly, many sporting bodies have condemned the event. The Australian Olympic Committee called it “dangerous and irresponsible,” saying that “the world needs better than this.”\\n   \\n      UK Anti-Doping (UKAD) said it “is extremely concerned by the concept of an Enhanced Games,” adding that “there is no place in sport for performance enhancing drugs, nor the Enhanced Games.”\\n   \\n      UKAD’s Director of Operations, Hamish Coffey, told CNN Sport that the Enhanced Games sets a “hugely dangerous precedent,” expressing concern over the kind of messaging the event sends to the next generation of athletes.\\n   \\n      When CNN Sport spoke to D’Souza shortly after the proposed event’s announcement, he said that 368 athletes had enquired about the Enhanced Games and more had messaged via social media.\\n   \\n      The organization’s Chief Athletes Officer and former Olympian Brett Fraser, who swam for the Cayman Islands at three Olympic Games, told CNN Sport that “very accomplished athletes” at the level of Olympic finalists have reached out “to understand more about how the first Games will take place and how they can become involved.”\\n   \\n      Fraser added that Enhanced Games organizers “already have an Olympic medallist” for their athlete commission, though he didn’t specify who that was.\\n   \\n      He also said there has been “a lot of positive feedback and a lot of acceptance and excitement from younger generations.” Nonetheless, none of the athletes appear prepared to speak publicly at this stage.\\n   \\n      For those who do want to compete, the Enhanced Games would be an annual event with five categories – track and field, swimming, weightlifting, gymnastics and martial arts.\\n   \\n      The huge cost of hosting an Olympic Games is no secret, with countries often striving to create bigger and better spectacles by blowing their budget.\\n   \\n      Tokyo 2021 had the largest Olympic sports program in history, with 33 sports competitions in 42 venues culminating in 339 medal events.\\n   \\n      The Covid-impacted Games were delivered with a final expenditure of $13 billion – almost double the $7.3 billion that was originally forecast. Meanwhile, keeping the IOC’s philosophy of “lower-impact Games” in mind, 95% of venues will be pre-existing facilities at the Paris 2024 Olympics.\\n   \\n      D’Souza said the Enhanced Games will focus on fewer sports, reuse existing infrastructure and fund the event through the private sector to “deliver a high-impact yet cost-efficient games” so profits can be shared with the athletes.\\n   \\n      He added that the Enhanced Games is looking for a seven-figure prize pool for any athlete potentially breaking Usain Bolt’s 100-meter world record of 9.58 seconds.\\n   \\n      “I’ve had conversations with people who are top-10 sprinters in the world who are going to the next Olympics, and they said […] if there’s a million-dollar prize to break the 100m world record, I’ll be there,” said D’Souza.\\n   \\n      Universal basic income and mental health support to athletes will also be part of an “enhanced athletes programme.”\\n   \\n      When asked who would take responsibility if an athlete competing at the Enhanced Games were to suffer fatal consequences, D’Souza told CNN Sport that “our athletes at the games will be the most monitored athletes in history.”\\n   \\n      He said: “We will focus on athlete safety by mandating athletes have pre-competition full-system clinical screenings including blood tests and EKGs.”\\n   \\n      “This will ensure that athletes are healthy to complete and not at risk of major health complications.”\\n   \\n      D’Souza also said that athletes will sign waivers in order\\xa0to compete.\\n   \\n      As it stands, no venues are officially in place to host the event and D’Souza admits its scale will be dependent on funding and media partnerships.\\n   \\n      “We’re in commercial negotiations with venues and media partners at the moment,” added D’Souza, who said the first Enhanced Games will be at a university campus or a similar facility in the south of the US and that a number of trademarks have been filed with the United States Patent and Trademark Office.\\n   \\n      Elite performance coach Trevor Painter, who has worked with a number of Olympic and international sprinters and middle-distance runners, said he would “never” coach an athlete taking performance-enhancing drugs because it would go against his morals as a coach.\\n   \\n      “Having been involved with many athletes that have lost in many ways to the cheats, I won’t be engaging with [the Enhanced Games],” Painter told CNN Sport.\\n   \\n      If it goes ahead as planned in December 2024, D’Souza insists that the Enhanced Games will unlock the potential of humanity.\\n   \\n      But according to John William Devine, Senior Lecturer in Ethics, Sport and Exercise Sciences at Swansea University in Wales, the Enhanced Games will make sporting competition more unfair than it already is and even “undermine the very purpose of the sport in question.”\\n   \\n      Devine told CNN Sport that “performance-enhancing drugs don’t actually lead to better athletic performance. They obscure athletic performance.”\\n   \\n      He added that, although the Enhanced Games may look very similar to the Olympics, the nature of the activity will be different, raising the question: “To what extent is drug-assisted performance reflective of the athletes’ sporting excellence?”\\n   \\nWADA response in full:\\n \\nDetermining the level of prevalence is a priority for WADA and something that is being addressed. That is why we set up a\\xa0Working Group on Doping Prevalence\\xa0in 2017. Measuring doping prevalence is a difficult and complex process. Through its work, the group found a huge variance across the many prevalence studies that have been carried out, leading it to publish guidelines on how to improve the quality of measuring prevalence. WADA is currently developing a tool that Anti-Doping Organizations can use to evaluate the effectiveness of their programs.\\n \\nWADA is well aware of the [Faiss] study. Indeed, one of the contributors, Prof. Martial Saugy, is a member of the Working Group. This study is one of many that helps to inform the Group’s work. It is a very narrow study. It looks at two events, in a single sport, held 10 and 12 years ago, using just one method of measurement (the Athlete Biological Passport (ABP)). As far as I am aware, there is no comparable data from more recent World Championships in the same sport. Given its limited scope, it is important that this study be analyzed within the wider context of other studies and not be taken in isolation.\\n \\nThis study also highlights the complexity of trying to measure prevalence. It is the third published paper that sought to measure prevalence at the 2011 Athletics World Championships. Each reported greatly varying results.\\n \\nThe fact is no single method will give a definitive prevalence figure for doping in all sports or even a single discipline. Results will always come with caveats and margins of error and will be based on a variety of methods, including self-report questionnaires, analytical methods (like ABP and testing data) and other methods to give a more rounded estimate of what the most likely figure would be.\\n \\nComparing the 15-18% found in the Faiss study with the global anti-doping system’s testing figures isn’t comparing like with like. The 2% quoted includes all sports and all countries and is not a useful guide for estimating prevalence. In any event, a single rate for all of global sport is not particularly helpful given the differences that occur between sports and countries – it would almost certainly overestimate some sports and countries, and underestimate others. The Faiss figures, on the other hand, refer to one sport, at two points in time, more than a decade ago. It is not useful or fair to compare these two figures.\\n',\n",

       "  'contents': ' \\n      The 2024 Olympics are fast approaching and as athletes gear up for one of the world’s most prestigious sporting events, one entrepreneur has a different idea of what “faster, higher, stronger” – the former motto of the Games – might represent.\\n   \\n      The Enhanced Games says it is an “alternative” to what it calls the “corrupt Olympics Games.”\\n   \\n      Athletes competing at the Enhanced Games will be free to use performance-enhancing drugs, they won’t be tested and will be under no obligation to declare which substances they have taken in order to compete.\\n   \\n      That’s quite a contrast to the Olympics’ doping protocols. The International Testing Agency (ITA) will be responsible for looking after Paris 2024’s anti-doping program. Six years ago, the International Olympic Committee (IOC), which oversees the Olympics, delegated its entire clean sport program to the ITA. However, historically the Olympic Games have been dogged by a series of doping and kickback scandals.\\n   \\n      When approached for comment on the Enhanced Games and allegations of corruption, the IOC told CNN Sport that “the idea does not merit any comment.”\\n   \\n      CNN Sport interviewed a number of experts in the field of doping for this story, who expressed concern that the Enhanced Games was an extremely dangerous proposition.\\n   \\nDr. Grigory Rodchenkov, who exposed Russia’s state-sponsored doping program – a massive, years-long effort which benefited more than 1,000 athletes between 2011 and 2015 – said that the Enhanced Games is a “danger to health, to sport.”\\n   \\n      Whether the Enhanced Games will ever take place remains an open question, but the very idea is drawing considerable blowback from leading anti-doping officials and sporting organizations.\\n   \\n      The Enhanced Games is the brainchild of businessman Aron D’Souza. He is also the founding editor of “The Journal Jurisprudence,” a quarterly publication on legal philosophy, according to his website, which also describes him as an “avid athlete.”\\n   \\n      Recently, D’Souza told CNN Sport he has “signed term sheets with prominent venture capital firms” in relation to the Enhanced Games and is “waiting on the lawyers to finish long-form drafting.” He also said that a funding announcement is planned for early December.\\n   \\n      Although not legally binding, term sheets are a serious expression of intent by both sides, setting out the broad principles of an agreement.\\n   \\n      D’Souza believes what he calls a “science-driven” competition is the next step in the evolution of sport, suggesting that the absence of drug testing will level the playing field.\\n   \\n      While data from the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) suggests that less than 2% of athletes dope, Raphael Faiss, Research Manager at the centre of Research and Expertise in anti-doping sciences at the University of Lausanne, told CNN Sport that the number of athletes taking performance-enhancing drugs is likely significantly higher; his research suggests the figure could be between 15 to 18%.\\n   \\n      Faiss and his team compared athletes’ blood results collected by WADA-accredited labs to values from healthy adults, as well as doped and undoped athletes; the closer the values are to those of subjects to whom erythropoietin (EPO, which is used in blood doping) had been administered, the higher the chances that they’re actually doping.\\n   \\n      This analysis, Faiss said, is not proof of doping, but is a “robust way” of analyzing the data, allowing scientists to make an estimate for doping prevalence, as well as targeting athletes most likely to be doping.\\n   \\n      In written comments to CNN Sport, WADA said: “Determining the level of [doping] prevalence is a priority for WADA and something that is being addressed,” explaining that, since 2017, a “prevalence working group” has been established to “determine if strategies, reliable methods and tools can be developed to adequately assess the prevalence of doping in sports.”\\n   \\n      WADA told CNN Sport that the group has delivered “several recommendations and guidance to WADA but not the final ones yet.”\\n   \\n      WADA has reservations about Faiss’ study and pointed to the “complexity of trying to measure [doping] prevalence,” highlighting that reports have “greatly varying results.”\\n   \\n      The anti-doping organization added: “No single method will give a definitive prevalence figure for doping in all sports or even a single discipline.”\\n   \\nEditor’s note: You can find WADA’s full statement at the bottom of this article.\\xa0\\n \\n      Travis Tygart, the Chief Executive Officer at the United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA), told CNN Sport that the idea of an Enhanced Games is “farcical … likely illegal in many [US] states” and “a dangerous clown show, not real sport.”\\n   \\n      Substances such as anabolic steroids – which help to build muscle mass by enabling athletes to train harder and recover quickly from strenuous workouts – are classified as a Schedule III drug by the US Drug Enforcement Administration.\\n   \\n      When asked whether anabolic steroids will be allowed at the games and whether athletes would be tested for illegal drugs such as cocaine, D’Souza told CNN Sport that “we will not be drug testing at the games.”\\n   \\n      He added: “We do not propose to regulate what athletes use.”\\n   \\n      Anabolic steroids may be prescribed by a licensed physician for the treatment of certain conditions such as testosterone deficiency, but if used in the US without a prescription from a licensed physician, a first conviction could result in a one-year prison sentence and a $1,000 fine.\\n   \\n      But that isn’t the only potential legal jeopardy the Enhanced Games faces, according to American lawyer Jim Walden, who represents Russian whistleblower Grigory Rodchenkov.\\n   \\n      “If you look at the Enhanced Games website, it’s almost as though they’re advertising their disregard of the law,” Walden told CNN Sport.\\n   \\n      “They wrap themselves up in what I will call the cloak of legitimacy by using phrases like body autonomy and coming out as an enhanced athlete.\\n   \\n      “I hope they’re thinking hard about how they’re going to pull this off in the world in which the FBI has a specific unit that is called the Sports and Gaming Initiative that’s focusing on these very issues.”\\n   \\n      The Sports and Gaming Initiative was developed to “protect athletes and sporting institutions in the United States from criminal threats and influences,” according to the government website.\\n   \\n      The initiative works in partnership with sports leagues and governing bodies, international law enforcement and independent watchdog groups to tackle crimes such as fraud, doping and match-fixing; criminal activities, it says, “degrade the integrity of sports and competition and erode public confidence in these cherished institutions.”\\n   \\n      “The use of doping substances is not acceptable in modern sports,” Rodchenkov said in his written comments to CNN.\\n   \\n      “Promotion and advertising of banned substances is against sport rules and moral, letter and spirit.\\n   \\n      “It might bring an extreme harm to young generation[s] of athletes who mistakenly could believe in benefits of [the] Enhanced Games.”\\n   \\n      Rodchenkov, the protagonist of the Oscar-winning Netflix documentary Icarus who is currently under FBI protection, also believes that the Enhanced Games’ organizers “might get investigated […] under the Rodchenkov Act.”\\n   \\n      The Rodchenkov Anti-Doping Act, named after the whistleblower, allows the US to impose criminal sanctions on individuals involved in doping activities at international events.\\n   \\n      However, the Rodchenkov Anti-Doping Act does not apply to sporting events that don’t adopt the WADA code, which the Enhanced Games wouldn’t do.\\n   \\n      Rodchenkov also added that WADA athletes could not have any affiliation or contact with so-called enhanced athletes, or they would risk being charged under Article 2.10 – “Prohibited Association by an Athlete or Other Person” – of the World Anti-Doping Code.\\n   \\n      USADA’s Tygart also told CNN Sport: “No one really wants our children growing up idolizing unbridled drug use in sport, even if some profiteers think otherwise.”\\n   \\n      D’Souza insists his motivation for founding the Enhanced Games isn’t financial.

Meanwhile, keeping the IOC’s philosophy of “lower-impact Games” in mind, 95% of venues will be pre-existing facilities at the Paris 2024 Olympics.\\n   \\n      D’Souza said the Enhanced Games will focus on fewer sports, reuse existing infrastructure and fund the event through the private sector to “deliver a high-impact yet cost-efficient games” so profits can be shared with the athletes.\\n   \\n      He added that the Enhanced Games is looking for a seven-figure prize pool for any athlete potentially breaking Usain Bolt’s 100-meter world record of 9.58 seconds.\\n   \\n      “I’ve had conversations with people who are top-10 sprinters in the world who are going to the next Olympics, and they said […] if there’s a million-dollar prize to break the 100m world record, I’ll be there,” said D’Souza.\\n   \\n      Universal basic income and mental health support to athletes will also be part of an “enhanced athletes programme.”\\n   \\n      When asked who would take responsibility if an athlete competing at the Enhanced Games were to suffer fatal consequences, D’Souza told CNN Sport that “our athletes at the games will be the most monitored athletes in history.”\\n   \\n      He said: “We will focus on athlete safety by mandating athletes have pre-competition full-system clinical screenings including blood tests and EKGs.”\\n   \\n      “This will ensure that athletes are healthy to complete and not at risk of major health complications.”\\n   \\n      D’Souza also said that athletes will sign waivers in order\\xa0to compete.\\n   \\n      As it stands, no venues are officially in place to host the event and D’Souza admits its scale will be dependent on funding and media partnerships.\\n   \\n      “We’re in commercial negotiations with venues and media partners at the moment,” added D’Souza, who said the first Enhanced Games will be at a university campus or a similar facility in the south of the US and that a number of trademarks have been filed with the United States Patent and Trademark Office.\\n   \\n      Elite performance coach Trevor Painter, who has worked with a number of Olympic and international sprinters and middle-distance runners, said he would “never” coach an athlete taking performance-enhancing drugs because it would go against his morals as a coach.\\n   \\n      “Having been involved with many athletes that have lost in many ways to the cheats, I won’t be engaging with [the Enhanced Games],” Painter told CNN Sport.\\n   \\n      If it goes ahead as planned in December 2024, D’Souza insists that the Enhanced Games will unlock the potential of humanity.\\n   \\n      But according to John William Devine, Senior Lecturer in Ethics, Sport and Exercise Sciences at Swansea University in Wales, the Enhanced Games will make sporting competition more unfair than it already is and even “undermine the very purpose of the sport in question.”\\n   \\n      Devine told CNN Sport that “performance-enhancing drugs don’t actually lead to better athletic performance. They obscure athletic performance.”\\n   \\n      He added that, although the Enhanced Games may look very similar to the Olympics, the nature of the activity will be different, raising the question: “To what extent is drug-assisted performance reflective of the athletes’ sporting excellence?”\\n   \\nWADA response in full:\\n \\nDetermining the level of prevalence is a priority for WADA and something that is being addressed. That is why we set up a\\xa0Working Group on Doping Prevalence\\xa0in 2017. Measuring doping prevalence is a difficult and complex process. Through its work, the group found a huge variance across the many prevalence studies that have been carried out, leading it to publish guidelines on how to improve the quality of measuring prevalence. WADA is currently developing a tool that Anti-Doping Organizations can use to evaluate the effectiveness of their programs.\\n \\nWADA is well aware of the [Faiss] study. Indeed, one of the contributors, Prof. Martial Saugy, is a member of the Working Group. This study is one of many that helps to inform the Group’s work. It is a very narrow study. It looks at two events, in a single sport, held 10 and 12 years ago, using just one method of measurement (the Athlete Biological Passport (ABP)). As far as I am aware, there is no comparable data from more recent World Championships in the same sport. Given its limited scope, it is important that this study be analyzed within the wider context of other studies and not be taken in isolation.\\n \\nThis study also highlights the complexity of trying to measure prevalence. It is the third published paper that sought to measure prevalence at the 2011 Athletics World Championships. Each reported greatly varying results.\\n \\nThe fact is no single method will give a definitive prevalence figure for doping in all sports or even a single discipline. Results will always come with caveats and margins of error and will be based on a variety of methods, including self-report questionnaires, analytical methods (like ABP and testing data) and other methods to give a more rounded estimate of what the most likely figure would be.\\n \\nComparing the 15-18% found in the Faiss study with the global anti-doping system’s testing figures isn’t comparing like with like. The 2% quoted includes all sports and all countries and is not a useful guide for estimating prevalence. In any event, a single rate for all of global sport is not particularly helpful given the differences that occur between sports and countries – it would almost certainly overestimate some sports and countries, and underestimate others. The Faiss figures, on the other hand, refer to one sport, at two points in time, more than a decade ago. It is not useful or fair to compare these two figures.\\n',\n",

       " {'headline': '\\n      Filmmaker Fisher Stevens explains how ‘Succession’ and Leonardo DiCaprio helped land him David Beckham’s documentary series\\n    ',\n",
       "  'contents': ' \\n      At first glance, the American actor and filmmaker Fisher Stevens wasn’t the obvious choice to helm the four-part Netflix documentary series about English soccer great David Beckham. Even Stevens himself shares that view.\\n   \\n      “When they first called me, my response was …’why me for David Beckham?’” the 59-year-old said to CNN Sport’s Don Riddell. “I didn’t know his story like you guys in the UK.”\\n   \\n      Turns out that looks can be deceiving, as the subject of Stevens’s lens knows all too well.\\n   \\n      The eponymously titled “Beckham” charts the former England captain’s remarkable rise (and fall, and subsequent rise). From the unassuming schoolboy taken under the wing of Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson, to playing stints in Spain, America, Italy and France. Then, after retirement, his return to the United States as a founder and owner of Major League Soccer (MLS) side Inter Miami, where Beckham has already proved instrumental in the game-changing signing of the seven-time Ballon d’Or winner Lionel Messi.\\n   \\n      Along the way, the now 48-year-old Englishman experienced incredible highs on the pitch – winning a treble of trophies with Manchester United in 1999, scoring the dramatic free kick to send England to the 2002 World Cup – and lows, notably a red card against Argentina at the 1998 World Cup, which led to him becoming the target of vicious vitriol in England.\\n   \\n      Following the 1998 World Cup, Beckham took solace in his relationship with the Spice Girl Victoria “Posh Spice” Adams, whom he married 24 years ago. The “Posh and Becks” moniker serves as a timely reminder that Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce weren’t the first musical-sporting collaboration.\\n   \\n      As for the man behind the camera, Stevens credits Becks’ fellow Brits, Jesse Armstrong, the writer/creator of HBO’s “Succession,” and the show’s executive producer Tony Roche, in convincing him to consider taking the gig (Stevens played the role of Hugo on “Succession”; HBO is part of the Warner Bros. Discovery family, along with CNN).\\n   \\n      It probably didn’t hurt the Oscar winner’s cause that Beckham was familiar with his work, to say nothing of Leonardo DiCaprio recommending Stevens directly to his friend Beckham. DiCaprio and Stevens made the climate change documentary “Before the Flood,” which was released in 2016.\\n   \\n      “I said, ‘Hey, I have a call with David Beckham, but I’m not sure,’” Fisher fondly recalled.\\n   \\n      “They’re like, ‘He’s a legend! You have to do it! He’s an incredible player!’ I went ‘really?’ So I was like, ‘okay.’ And then I just went home and watched and watched and saw how brilliant he was.”\\n   \\n      Not so much “Bend It Like Beckham” then, but rather “Bend Your Ear About Beckham.”\\n   \\n      A powerful, successful figure consumed by ambition, inevitably comparisons with “Succession” and the Logan Roy empire abound.\\n   \\n      Stevens admitted that “ironically” Brand Beckham didn’t interest him when making the film.\\n   \\n      “To be honest, that’s what I kind of thought about David before I met him. Like he’s always building a brand … so the brand is, I guess, it’s strong. I say what’s really strong, their relationship is really strong and if you can work with your wife and it works, God bless, man,” he said.\\n   \\n      Some of the key themes which emerge in “Beckham” are his relationships with the influential men in his life – his dad, Ted, but also the imposing Ferguson.\\n   \\n      The Scot nurtured Beckham in the 1990’s, but their relationship soured at United after Beckham’s celebrity reached global status. The pair talk about the infamous boot-kicking incident – when an enraged Ferguson kicked a boot in the changing room hitting Beckham above the eye - and Beckham’s subsequent sale to Real Madrid in 2003.\\n   \\n      It also focuses on Beckham’s marriage. And while rumors of infidelity are never directly addressed by name, a playful yet respectful partnership is often exhibited by the pair throughout the four episodes.\\n   \\n      So what does Stevens think is the secret of their success as a couple?\\n   \\n      “Another thing that’s shocked me about making this film was just how close they are, and how reliant they are on each other, and they kind of don’t make big moves at all without discussing whatever it is,” he said.\\n   \\n      “The biggest success for them is that they see eye to eye on raising their children and they have a very strong family. They are really ambitious people and I think it’s harder for a woman to be ambitious than a man.\\n   \\n      “I think David loves Victoria’s ambition and Victoria loves David’s ambition, and that’s what keeps them together as well.”\\n   \\n      In addition to ambition, Beckham’s relentless pursuit for perfection reveals itself, often in unexpected ways, such as his obsession with cleanliness.\\n   \\n      “Hates mess,” notes Stevens. “The first day I interviewed him, we moved a couple of things out of the way. And as soon as the interview finished, the first thing he did after his exhaustion or whatever, is he would put the room back.\\n   \\n      “I’m like, ‘David we’ll do it.’ ‘No, no, no, no. You won’t do it. You don’t know where anything goes.’”\\n   \\n      “And I’m like, ‘David, can I film you doing this?’ ‘Absolutely not. You can’t film me doing this.’ And of course, by the end, I convinced him to let me, because that cleaning up in the kitchen in the last episode, I mean, I saw him when I walked in one day, he was scrubbing the kitchen and then he saw me and he stopped.\\n   \\n      “I mean, that’s crazy. I wish I was that clean. And that’s why his precision of passing, precision of a corner, precision of everything, that’s just who he is.\\n   \\n      “And unfortunately, he’s very rarely able to just kind of be still, and happy, and content, because he’s always trying to make everything perfect. But that’s why he’s also such a good guy, because he’s worried about you too.”\\n   \\n      When pushed by Variety magazine about a possible second series, Stevens went as far as using the word “maybe.”\\n   \\n      With material left on the cutting room floor about Beckham’s association with Qatar, his lifelong affinity towards Judaism (his grandfather Joseph West was Jewish), and much more besides – including the importance of his tattoos, and getting knighted - perhaps “Beckham” can go into extra time.\\n   \\n      “Honestly, I wish we had another episode because there was so much stuff. We talked about everything. He was super open,” Stevens told CNN.\\n  ',\n",

       " {'headline': '\\n      Norway’s fastest – and most famous – running family is ripped apart by allegations of ‘aggression and physical punishment’\\n    ',\n",
       "  'contents': ' \\n      In a quiet corner of a Tokyo stadium, a father wipes tears away from his eyes. He has just watched his 20-year-old son win a\\xa0first Olympic gold in thrilling fashion,\\xa0patiently chasing down and passing\\xa0fierce Kenyan rival Timothy Cheruiyot on the final bend of the 1,500-meter\\xa0final.\\n   \\n      The moment would be an emotional one for any parent, but even more so if you have coached your son throughout his running career. Such was the case for Gjert Ingebrigtsen, who\\xa0was the coach to three of his seven children: Henrik, Filip and Jakob, the one who raced to Olympic gold in Tokyo two years ago.\\n   \\n      Today, however, the family dynamic has shifted. The three running brothers ended their coaching relationship with their father last year, prompting a swathe of speculation about a potential rift in Norway’s fastest – and\\xa0most famous\\xa0– sporting family.\\n   \\n      Now the three brothers have spoken publicly about the reasons for no longer being coached by their father, alleging that he is aggressive, controlling and has used physical violence and threats towards them.\\n   \\n      “We still feel discomfort and fear, which lays within us since childhood,” Henrik, Filip, and Jakob wrote in a story for Norwegian newspaper VG, which was published last week.\\n   \\n      “Somehow, we have accepted this. We have lived with it, and in adult age we have moved on. At least we thought so. In retrospect, we realize that it was naive.”\\n   \\n      They said that two years ago, a few months before ending their coaching relationship with their father, “the same aggression and physical punishment struck again. That was the final straw.”\\n   \\n      Gjert Ingebrigtsen has denied these accusations. In comments sent to CNN Sport via his legal representative, Elden Advokatfirma, he said: “The statements that my\\xa0sons\\xa0made are baseless. I have never used violence against my children.\\n   \\n      “That I have had weaknesses as a father, and have been too much of a coach, is a realization I have also come to\\xa0–\\xa0albeit far too late.”\\n   \\n      On Thursday, Norwegian police said that they had carried out “preliminary investigations” into the brothers’\\xa0allegations and have now opened a case under a criminal code relating to “abuse in close relationships.”\\n   \\n      In a statement shared with CNN Sport, inspector Terese Braut Våge said: “This means that we are now in an investigation phase, where the purpose of the investigation is to uncover whether there are criminal circumstances.”\\n   \\n      John Christian Elden, the lawyer representing Gjert, told CNN Sport that his client has not yet been charged with any criminal offense.\\n   \\n      “This was not unexpected, and my client is confident of the outcome of such an investigation,” said Elden, adding that it is Gjert’s “only opportunity to be cleared of any wrongdoing.”\\n   \\n      The brothers’ account of their relationship with their father in VG did not provide details about specific instances of abuse or physical violence.\\xa0And days after the story was published, another Ingebrigtsen brother, Martin, who is not a professional athlete, defended Gjert, telling VG: “Fortunately, fear is an unknown feeling to me. I never feared dad.\\n   \\n      “I must honestly admit that I find it difficult to see this great fear, when others in the family are constantly visiting and have recently been on holiday with Gjert.”\\n   \\n      In an interview with the New York Times last year, Jakob spoke about the tension within the family, saying: “Our father is really anxious and that affects everybody around him. And that quickly evolves to anger towards competitions. Because he’s anxious and he has nerves and he responds by getting irritated and angry about the little stuff.”\\n   \\n      CNN has contacted representatives for the Ingebrigtsen brothers for further comment.\\n   \\n      Henrik, 32, Filip, 30, and Jakob, 23, are all decorated middle and long-distance runners.\\xa0Jakob, however, is the family’s most\\xa0successful\\xa0athlete, winning world and Olympic titles and setting indoor records over 1,500m\\xa0and 2,000m.\\n   \\n      “Jakob is one of the best and biggest athletes in Norway – like [soccer players] Erling Haaland and Martin Ødegaard, or [golfer]\\xa0Viktor Hovland,” Herman Folvik, a sports journalist for VG, told CNN Sport.\\n   \\n      But it’s not for their running prowess alone that the brothers have gained\\xa0celebrity status\\xa0in Norway.\\xa0Team Ingebrigtsen, a documentary series first aired in 2016, has shed light on the family dynamic, particularly the father-coach relationship between Gjert and his sons.\\n   \\n      “I would say that after the royal family, I think they are the most famous family in Norway,” said Folvik. “[The documentary] about the running brothers and Gjert also got really close to the mother [Tone] and the other siblings.”\\n   \\n      The brothers and Gjert announced their split in February 2022, less than a year after Jakob had won gold at the Tokyo Olympics.\\n   \\n      In their story in VG, which was published on October 19,\\xa0Henrik, Filip, and Jakob\\xa0explained how media scrutiny of their relationship with Gjert had compelled them to speak publicly about their family environment.\\n   \\n      “When we broke with Gjert, we thought we would be able to handle the situation in an orderly manner, without mentioning the underlying circumstances,” they said.\\n   \\n      “We now realize that is not possible. This matter has become so inflamed, and has had such great consequences, that we feel a responsibility to clean it up.”\\n   \\n      They described the situation as a “family conflict” and said that they now hope to achieve “peace for all parties.”\\n   \\n      In his comments to CNN Sport, Gjert lamented the “tragic situation” for the Ingebrigtsens.\\n   \\n      “Our family has lived in the public spotlight for many years, and we have chosen to let the public into our lives through TV series, interviews and much more,” he said.\\n   \\n      “That violence should have occurred in this public family life is unthinkable. The Norwegian people have seen our lives, for better or for worse … I don’t know how we’re going to get past this – but we have to try.”\\n   \\n      The situation between the father and his three sons is complicated by the fact that Gjert is currently coaching another Norwegian athlete, Narve Gilje Nordås, who won a bronze medal in the 1,500 meters at this year’s world championships – finishing fractionally behind Jakob.\\n   \\n      The Norwegian Athletics Federation has recently said that Gjert would not be granted accreditation as a coach for international competitions – next year’s world indoor championships and European championships.\\n   \\n      In two separate statements, the federation said that it wants to create a “safe environment” for athletes and made reference to comments made by the Ingebrigtsen brothers in the media.\\xa0It also said that it would recommend that Gjert would not receive accreditation for next year’s Paris Olympics.\\n   \\n      Nordås, meanwhile, has said that he plans to make a statement in the coming days. He has called the situation absurd and said he continues to train with Gjert.\\n   \\n      As for Jakob, he is essentially self-coached but continues to lean on his older brothers for advice. Still arguably the most dominant middle-distance runner in the world, he holds lofty ambitions for his track and field career.\\n   \\n      “I don’t want to sound immodest,” he said in an interview earlier this year, “but my main goal is to become the best runner of all time, for which I still have a lot of work to do.”\\n  ',\n",

       "  'contents': ' \\n      After a season filled with absorbing storylines, the top players on tour will converge at the WTA Finals this week with the year-end No. 1 ranking and $9 million in prize money at stake.\\n   \\n      A different player has won each grand slam this year and, reflecting the lack of a completely dominant player on tour, there isn’t an outright favorite for the WTA Finals.\\n   \\n      Rather, there is a set of intriguing questions that surrounds each player: Can Aryna Sabalenka seal her place as arguably this year’s best player? Can Iga Świątek reclaim her invincible aura? Can Coco Gauff continue her run of impressive form?\\n   \\n      There will be a new winner of the trophy, since none of the eight qualified players have ever won the competition before, while the year-end world No. 1 title is at stake too.\\n   \\n      After reaching at least the semifinals in every grand slam and winning the Australian Open, Sabalenka is currently the world No. 1. She can secure the year-end ranking with two group stage victories but if she slips up and Iga Świątek reaches the final, the Pole can regain the position she previously held for 75 weeks.\\n   \\n      The first game takes place on October 29 and the tournament lasts a week until the final on November 5.\\n   \\n      Tennis fans in the USA will be able to watch on the Tennis Channel, while those in the UK and Ireland can watch on Amazon Prime Video. A full list including other countries’ broadcasters is available here.\\n   \\n      Sabalenka will head to the field as the world No. 1 and will be joined by Wimbledon champion Markéta Vondroušová, US Open champion Coco Gauff, French Open champion Świątek, Wimbledon finalist Ons Jabeur, Elena Rybakina and US star Jessica Pegula.\\n   \\n      Czech Republic’s Karolína Muchová was forced to withdraw from the competition through injury and has subsequently been replaced by Greece’s Maria Sakkari.\\n   \\n      The eight players are divided between two groups of four, with the top two from each pool progressing to the semifinals.\\n   \\n      In one group Sabalenka, Rybakina, Pegula and Sakkari will face each other while Swiatek, Gauff, Jabeur and Vondrousova will play each other in the other.\\n   \\n      Familiar match-ups are contained within each group. Sabalenka defeated Rybakina in the Australian Open earlier this year, while Rybakina exacted her revenge in the Indian Wells final. In the other group, meanwhile, Gauff and Swiatek will play each other for the 10th time in their relatively young careers.\\n   \\n      “I’m coming in with a lot of confidence,” Gauff said, according to the WTA, as she enters the tournament fresh from her first grand slam triumph at the US Open. “Last year, I didn’t do so well, so it’s nothing but up.”\\n   \\n      This year’s edition will be held in Cancun, Mexico – the second time the country has hosted the tournament after Guadalajara was the venue in 2021.\\n   \\n      Eight pairs have also reached the doubles tournament, with the US pairing of Gauff Pegula qualifying as top seeds.\\n   \\n      Defending champion Elise Mertens tops the other pool, joining forces with Storm Hunter instead of her partner last year, Veronika Kudermetova.\\n  ',\n",

       "  'contents': ' \\n      Fluorescent lighting, dark tunnels, scurrying rats and questionable dripping: New York City’s subway stations could serve as a spooky backdrop on nearly any day, but around Halloween, the sprawling subterranean system comes alive with bustling costumed figures — all of whom have somewhere to be, thanks.\\n   \\n      For nearly two decades, one New York photographer, who goes by the artist name Seymour Licht, has documented spectral, peculiar and outlandish parade- and partygoers in transit across the city. In one photo, an imitator of surrealist artist Rene Magritte sits in a train car, holding a picture frame with an apple suspended above his face; in another, the dark-haired ghoulish Samara from the cult horror film “The Ring” waits underground for the next train to arrive.\\n   \\n      Now, Licht, has put together a book called “Halloween Underground,” timed to the 50th anniversary of the Village Halloween Parade.\\n   \\n      “I started with documentary (photography), just recording what I saw,” Licht said in a phone call. “And then I was so transfixed, that I wanted to elevate it and (make it) more magical and surreal.”\\n   \\n      Though Licht has photographed above-ground revelers, too, he found he was more drawn to the transitory themes unfolding as crowds moved through downtown hubs including Union Square and West 4th Street in Manhattan, and busy stations like Bedford Avenue in Brooklyn.\\n   \\n      “The subway is a liminal space, and Halloween is a liminal time,” he said, referring to its origins in Samhain, the ancient Gaelic festival that signaled the end of harvest season. “It’s the time when the dead come over to visit and mingle among the living.”\\n   \\n      Through his photos, one can chart changes to photography — Licht began with Fuji transparency film and shoots digitally now — updates to the subway and shifts in pop culture, too. There’s appearances by classic horror villains Pennywise and Michael Myers, glittering angels, a 6-foot-tall frog prince, and the married foxes from the 2009 Wes Anderson adaptation of “Fantastic Mr. Fox” among others.\\n   \\n      One unfortunate trend Licht has noticed, however? A drop in the complexity and originality of many ensembles.\\n   \\n      “I think the more elaborate costumes, where you see people put a lot of thought and time in it, are a little bit more uncommon,” he said of recent years.\\n   \\n      Twenty years on, Licht ultimately views the work as a “fantastical ride” through the underbelly of the city.\\n   \\n      “The wonderful thing about Halloween is that people generally are game for everything for anything,” he said. “They’re out there to have a good time. There is an air are being like a little bit mischievous and playful.”\\n   \\n“Halloween Underground” is available now. Scroll for a selection of photographs from the book.\\n',\n",

       " {'headline': '\\n      How Heidi Klum became the undisputed queen of celebrity Halloween\\n    ',\n",
       "  'contents': ' \\n      For over two decades now, Heidi Klum has served up tricks, treats and ever-outlandish ensembles to retain her title as the queen of celebrity Halloween costumes, arriving at her annual bash on or in gurneys, spaceships, biohazard trucks and clouds of smoke.\\n   \\n      And that’s before we even get to the looks themselves.\\n   \\n      When the German model first moved to the United States in 1993, she “immediately fell in love with Halloween and the spookiness of it,” Klum told The Hollywood Reporter in 2018. “All that was missing was a fantastic party. It felt like a real opportunity for me.”\\n   \\n      In the years since, Klum has spent hundreds of hours in, and likely hundreds of thousands of dollars on, hair, makeup and prosthetics preparing for her star-studded festivities, dedicated to her goal of doing for Halloween what nobody has dared do before.\\n   \\n      “I have sleepless nights over Halloween; you have no idea,” Klum told People magazine earlier this month. “I can’t rehearse this; it’s only on the day. I always hope that it works out.”\\n   \\n      Musing over what her next costume will be often begins the day after Halloween, she told THR, because of both enthusiasm and needing ample time to construct such elaborate costumes.\\n   \\n      We’ve yet to see what Klum has up her sleeve this spooky season, though she did tell Entertainment Tonight that “it’s going to be very colorful, and super big.” For now, then, here are some of her most iconic Halloween looks from years past — from 2022 dating back to the early aughts.\\n   \\n      Last Halloween, Klum wriggled and writhed into her annual party as a very realistic earthworm, with only her eyes peeking through the sculptural worm-suit itself. (She later changed into a sheer bedazzled bodysuit for the party — lest she be limited to doing the worm on the dance floor — but left her facial prothesis on.)\\n   \\n      Klum’s husband Tom Kaulitz accompanied her on the red carpet dressed as a fisherman with a ghoulish twist — a prosthetic eyeball hanging from his socket.\\n   \\n      Perhaps one of Klum’s creepiest costumes, her 2019 look saw her dressed in a head-to-toe bodysuit resembling a decomposing body — scarred and visceral, flayed in parts and with an exposed brain — seemingly revivified by cables and other surgical bits.\\n   \\n      Klum and Kaulitz — a zombified astronaut, naturally — arrived together in a biohazard truck.\\n   \\n      In 2018 Klum and Kaulitz dressed as animated movie stars Fiona and Shrek, respectively, in costumes so realistic it was as if they had walked off a character parade float at Universal Studios.\\n   \\n      Back in 2017, Klum paid homage to Michael Jackson’s “Thriller” music video by recreating the werewolf look Jackson transformed into in the music video’s movie-within-a-movie opening scene. As well as meticulously copying the clothes Jackson wore in the video, the costume\\xa0also incorporated prosthetics, so Klum’s werewolf face moved with her own features. (Klum’s zombie entourage, also pictured above, referenced the second horror movie trope referenced in “Thriller.”)\\n   \\n      Technically this wasn’t a costume “on” Klum, because she came to her party dressed as herself. Her Halloween twist, though, came with her plus-one — or plus-five, rather: a group of models she enlisted to appear as clones, using eerily-accurate prosthetics and identical outfits.\\n   \\n      Halloween is often synonymous with “sexy,” and in 2015 Klum went as one of Hollywood’s most iconic sex symbols, Jessica Rabbit — a costume both realistic and yet also so quintessentially cartoonish. The costume’s two hours-long removal at the end of the night — which cost her some of her own skin — called for a nail polish remover-like substance and a chisel, Klum told People magazine.\\n   \\n      As a longtime Victoria’s Secret Angel, Klum had spent years wearing wings for the lingerie brand’s annual Fashion Show, but never ones quite like this. For her 2014 party, Klum become a butterfly — with wings hand-painted by artisans who’d worked on Victoria’s Secret Angels’ wings. Her glowing bugs’ eyes were powered by batteries placed inside the mask, near her real eyes.\\n   \\n      Klum aged herself by a few decades for this Halloween costume. From head to toe, she was made unrecognizable with layers upon layers of makeup and prosthetics that gave her wrinkles, sagging skin, age spots and yellow teeth. (Nonetheless, she donned an elegant tweed twinset, paired with a paisley blouse, pearls and a tan handbag.)\\n   \\n      “Just going into my future is what I wanted to do for myself,” she told Yahoo Entertainment in 2022. “I wanted to, like, look in the mirror and be like, ‘OK, I want to see, you know, what I might look like when I’m like in my 80s.”\\n   \\n      A predecessor of sorts to her alien zombie look, Klum in 2011 wore a body suit (and matching face paint) designed to look like the human body sans skin. She made a grand entrance to her first of two parties that year in Las Vegas rolling in on a gurney pushed by two people dressed as bloody doctors.\\n   \\n      But that wasn’t all — in her second look for a party in New York City, Klum and then-husband Seal donned outfits inspired by the “Planet of the Apes” films.\\n   \\n      “We didn’t really think about, you know, going to the bathroom,” Klum told Yahoo Entertainment of the costumes. “It was very tricky.”\\n   \\n      In preparation for her red and purple costume that transformed her into a “Transformers”-worthy robot, for days Klum practiced walking on stilts in her backyard, she told People magazine. “It was amazing, though, because I was so tall and I could just tower over everyone,” Klum said — until she’d had a few drinks.\\n   \\n      Then nine months pregnant with her third child, Klum and then-husband Seal dressed as the biblical forbidden fruit (wrapped by the serpent, no less) and Eve, respectively. The original sin here, though, is the lack of effort put into Seal’s ensemble.\\n   \\n      In a testament to just how over-the-top Klum’s costumes have become, it’s telling that her 2004 look — a sexy vampire witch costume which featured a voluminous wig, oversize witch’s hat, knee-high boots and blood red makeup — now seems positively understated. “I was rigged from the ceiling and then I was flying over all the people like ‘Happy Halloween ha ha ha’ on my broom with a skeleton on my back,” she told People of her grand entrance to that year’s party.\\n   \\n      Since she wanted a full, realistic skeleton, Klum bought one from a supply store for doctor’s office materials.\\n   \\n      At her 2003 party, Klum made her arrival by exiting a golden spaceship, dressed as a cyberpunk-style golden alien. Reminiscent also of the Grecian god Hermes, her look featured gold armor and boots with leaf accents, golden belt detailing, gold body glitter, a golden grill and gold ribbons woven into her long braids.\\n   \\n      In 2001, Klum dressed as the 11th-century Anglo-Saxon gentlewoman Lady Godiva. Though the eponymous legend told of Godiva’s naked ride through the English town of Coventry on horseback, Klum covered up, wearing a white bodysuit with crystalline detailing. She added a long blonde wig.\\n   \\n      “I was always looking for something that I hadn’t seen, and so I was Lady Godiva,” Klum told People magazine.\\xa0“I came on a horse, obviously. It was a police horse from New York City.”\\n  ',\n",

       " {'headline': '\\n      How 2023 became the year of the lab-grown diamond\\n    ',\n",
       "  'contents': ' \\n  Editor’s Note: This article was originally published by The Business of Fashion, an editorial partner of CNN\\n \\n      In New York, a stretch of 47th Street is known as the Diamond District for the countless gem shops and appraisers that occupy just about every storefront and office. Some 40 blocks south, Pandora recently brought to life a competing vision for how stones are made, bought and sold.\\n   \\n      During New York Fashion Week at the start of September, the jewelry retailer shut down the busy thoroughfare of Astor Place to host a splashy party it dubbed the “lab-grown diamond district,” attended by fashion insiders and stars like Pamela Anderson, the face of the brand’s latest campaign.\\n   \\n      Pandora was never a big player in the diamond category. It built its jewelry brand — one of the world’s biggest with nearly $4 billion in revenue last year\\xa0— on charm bracelets that sell for under $100. But the surging popularity of lab-grown stones, which are structurally identical to mined diamonds but sell for a fraction of the price, has opened the doors for even relatively low-cost brands to offer serious bling.\\n   \\n      The company isn’t the only one seeing big sales from this category: Lab-grown diamond brand Brilliant Earth saw a 15.7 percent net sales increase in 2022, to $440 million. Dorsey, another exclusively lab-grown jewelry brand, sold over a million stones last year.\\n   \\n      Brands like these are changing how the jewelry business works: pieces typically fall into certain categories based on the types of materials used and the prices charged. Diamonds were the ultimate luxury signifier, their trade dominated by small, bespoke businesses or big brands like Tiffany and Cartier.\\n   \\n      Lab-grown stones have erased some of those distinctions. First developed in the 1980s, they are produced by exposing pure carbon to a large amount of heat and pressure in a metal cube, eventually creating a diamond. They are virtually indistinguishable from the traditional kind; realizing this, the diamond industry has invested in marketing designed to create two categories of stones in the minds of consumers.\\n   \\n      Those efforts haven’t worked, at least not for the most price-conscious consumers: a Tiffany tennis bracelet runs north of $20,000, while a bracelet containing similar, lab-grown carats from Brilliant Earth is $3,450.\\n   \\n      According to\\xa0jewelry industry analyst Paul Zimnisky, sales of these man-made diamonds have increased from under $1 billion in 2016 to just under $12 billion in 2022. They represent just over 17% of the overall diamond market, according to diamond research firm Edahn Golan. The rate of growth is accelerating: Lab-grown sales shot up 38% from 2021 to 2022.\\n   \\n      The rapid rise of lab-grown stones is reverberating across the market. Pandora has raised its sales outlook twice this year, and its share price has more than doubled in the past year. Meanwhile, the world’s largest diamond producer and distributor De Beers is cutting prices of mined stones by as much as 40 percent due to falling demand for traditional diamonds.\\n   \\n      “For most people, a diamond is a diamond, and what you want is the wonderful sparkle and the beauty and the meaning that you can put into a diamond,” said Mary Carmen Gasco-Buisson, chief marketing officer at Pandora in an interview with the Business of Fashion.\\n   \\n      Many consumers plough the savings from buying a lab-grown diamond into more jewelry — a bigger engagement ring, for instance. The technology has also brought more shoppers into the market to buy pieces for themselves, rather than simply waiting for their partners to do so, said Dorsey founder Megan Strachan.\\n   \\n      To reach those shoppers, brands are adjusting their marketing approach. While diamonds have always been marketed as a luxury, those ads have often been geared towards men buying jewelry for their partners. Now, jewelers are marketing to a broader set of customers, particularly women shopping for fashion items.\\n   \\n      “The lab-grown diamond is not in competition with mined diamonds, it’s a complement to mined diamonds,” said Sayed Haider, COO, merchandising and operations at Diamond Nexus, which added a line of lab-grown diamonds to its offering earlier this year. “You have a beautiful engagement ring, but you want to get a matching set of earrings or a pendant … You can get all those aspirational pieces that you always wanted.”\\n   \\n      Though lab-grown engagement rings are growing in popularity, non-bridal jewelry is where many brands are seeing the most growth.\\n   \\n      Dorsey is focused on selling items like tennis necklaces and bracelets and vintage-inspired earrings. Strachan said the decision stemmed from a feeling that there was a bigger gap to fill in everyday jewelry. As well, she added, it allows for customers to become repeat purchasers, whereas “bridal is a single purchase.”\\n   \\n      “Every time I went into a jewelry store in the past, I always felt like I couldn’t afford it,” she said. “(Lab-grown) is democratizing something that was essentially reserved for the wealthy.”\\n   \\n      Dorsey, which was founded in 2019, saw its sales grow 600 percent from 2021 to 2022, and is on track to double sales again this year. It’s profitable, buoyed by word-of-mouth marketing, particularly among influencers who are finding and talking about the product on their own.\\n   \\n      Marketing around man-made diamonds often performs double duty, both selling the individual item and countering the idea that greater accessibility equates with subpar quality. Dorsey photographs its products in editorial-like spreads that would look at home in the pages of\\xa0Vogue, marketing the jewelry like fashion, said Strachan. The brand’s Instagram feed is filled with sleek images of well-dressed women, including model Bella Hadid and Justin and Hailey Bieber wearing its necklaces.\\n   \\n      “The same way that we choose our shoes, we choose our jewelry, and I felt like that’s been missed (in marketing),” said Strachan.\\n   \\n      Pandora’s fall campaign highlighted the accessibility aspect of lab-grown stones with its tagline, “Diamonds for All,” but its fashion week event, and the hiring of stars like Anderson and model Precious Lee, shows how it too is repositioning its brand. Earlier this month, the brand unveiled a partnership with the British Fashion Council and will serve as a sponsor of The British Fashion Awards in December.\\n   \\n      Legacy jewelry brands have been slow to embrace their new competition. Even when De Beers started to dip into the space with its sub-brand Lightbox brand \\xa0in 2018, chief executive Bruce Cleaver positioned it as “affordable fashion jewelry that may not be forever, but is perfect for right now,” in a statement.\\n   \\n      Today, more high-end companies are beginning to inch into the lab-grown market. This month, LVMH-owned jeweler Fred has been showing a new collection featuring man-made stones to high-net-worth clients to test the product with wealthy shoppers. To differentiate from the brand’s mined offering, the new assortment of diamonds are blue.\\n   \\n      It’s become a trend legacy jewelry houses can’t ignore: According to Zimnisky, sales of lab-grown stones are likely to continue growing at an annual double-digit percentage rate in the next few years.\\n   \\n      “What started as a skepticism, or a question of if it will be an embarrassment, now carries a sense of pride,” said Amish Shah, the founder of lab-grown jewelry brand J’evar. “It’s the diamond of the future.”\\n   \\nEditor’s Note: This article was originally published by Business of Fashion, an editorial partner of CNN \\n',\n",

       " {'headline': '\\n      Kylie Jenner set to launch ‘accessible’ new clothing line\\n    ',\n",
       "  'contents': ' \\n      Moving beyond cosmetics, skincare and even a\\xa0Bratz doll line, the youngest Kardashian-Jenner sibling, Kylie Jenner, is expanding her business portfolio with a new clothing line,\\xa0named Khy,\\xa0launching November 1. While it’s not technically her first foray into fashion design — she and her older sister Kendall previously shared an eponymous, licensed line — Khy’s debut builds on Jenner’s well-established consumer base and, with pieces inspired by her “personal wardrobe,” her well-curated aesthetic.\\n   \\n      Jenner first teased the line in an\\xa0Instagram post\\xa0Tuesday, with an image of her in a long, puffy-sleeved faux-leather trench coat captioned, “meet khy.” A tag on the coat led to the brand’s Instagram account, which has since added photos of other faux-leather pieces, including a\\xa0strapless mini-dress\\xa0Jenner had earlier debuted at\\xa0Kim Kardashian’s birthday bash\\xa0last week.\\n   \\n      “Creativity, collaboration, and quality at an accessible price,” the brand wrote in an Instagram comment.\\n   \\n      Further insight into Khy\\xa0comes from WSJ. Magazine,\\xa0which debuted Jenner as a cover star for its November “Innovator’s Issue” on Wednesday. Described as a “global force in business,” Jenner is the magazine’s “Brand Innovator of the Year,” one of seven award recipients this year across “fashion, art, literature, entertainment, architecture, design, technology, music, philanthropy, cuisine and more.” (While the full line-up has yet to be revealed, other honorees include Martin Scorcese, the artist Ed Ruscha and fashion designer Jerry Lorenzo.)\\n   \\n      “The whole line is really inspired by my personal wardrobe, and the different moods that I’m in,” Jenner told WSJ. executive fashion director Rory Satran in an interview. She described Khy’s aesthetic as very “King Kylie — who I am at my core.”\\n   \\n      Khy will spotlight “different guest designers and concepts throughout the year,” WSJ reported. (The biker glam pieces that make up its first collection are in partnership with the Berlin-based fashion brand Namilia.) Jenner’s mother, Kris Jenner, serves as a Khy co-founder, alongside business power couple Jens and Emma Grede — who are in turn also the co-founders of Kim Kardashian’s Skims and Khloé Kardashian’s Good American.\\n   \\n      “Kylie’s obviously very aware of what she likes,” Haider Ackermann, the fashion designer behind\\xa0Jenner’s 2023 Met Gala gown, told WSJ. “She grew up in the attention of the public eye from the age of 9 — and she’s always been very attracted to clothes, makeup, to everything that would make\\xa0her world and imagination grow and be blown away. She’s always been seduced by it.”\\n   \\n      “Creatively I have such a strong vision of what I want to look like and what I want to do and what I want to wear,” Jenner told WSJ. “I never get too stressed about these things because… fashion is supposed to be fun.”\\n  ',\n",

       " {'headline': '\\n      How an 11th-century monastery reclaimed artifacts from the US — and discovered a hoard of treasures in the process\\n    ',\n",
       "  'contents': ' \\n      Hidden under years of dirt and grime in storage rooms, hundreds of precious religious objects have been rediscovered at a monastery in Nepal’s capital, Kathmandu. Gilded crowns worn by Buddhist priests, halos that once adorned statues of deities and mini stupas gifted by the local community are among the long-lost antiques now on display at Itumbaha, one of the city’s oldest “viharas,” an early form of a Buddhist monastery.\\n   \\n      The story of the objects’ rediscovery stretches far beyond the warren of shrines, courtyards and ornately decorated columns that have stood on the site since the 11th century. Until earlier this year, two of the sculptures were more than 7,500 miles away in New York’s Rubin Museum of Art, which specializes in Himalayan art, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art.\\n   \\n      Like many of Nepal’s religious sites, Itumbaha is no stranger to the theft and looting of its relics and architecture. Nepalese authorities estimate that up to 80% of the country’s religious artifacts have been stolen and sold on the black market since the 1980s. As museums digitize their collections and make them publicly available online, more claims are being made around the world for pillaged objects to be returned.\\n   \\n      Amid growing calls for Western museums to repatriate stolen cultural heritage, the Met announced in 2022 that it was returning a 13th-century wooden temple carving of a “salabhinka,” a semi-divine spirit, to Itumbaha. Earlier that year, the Rubin repatriated two Nepalese wooden carvings — one originating from the monastery, and the other from a nearby temple complex — that its researchers believe to have been looted.\\n   \\n      But for Itumbaha’s leaders, the process of recovering these objects was not only about addressing historical injustice. It sparked a dialogue that brought to fruition a long-time dream: a new museum, in the monastery grounds, to research and catalog its more than 500 artifacts. Opened in late July, it currently displays some 150 of the works, spanning six centuries, and tells the history of antiquities looting in Nepal. The rest of the objects remain in storage.\\n   \\n      It has long been known that Itumbaha harbored priceless artifacts, but locating and inventorying them was never a priority for the cash-strapped monastery. When the World Monument Fund, a private non-profit dedicated to preserving\\xa0cultural heritage, began reconstruction work on the site almost two decades ago, members of the vihara came across many objects “buried in layers of dust and dirt and mud and sand,” said Swosti Rajbhandari Kayastha, a museologist and Lumbini Buddhist University lecturer who was tasked with putting together the museum.\\n   \\n      Some of the items on display were already known about — like a gold crown worn by the vihara’s founder, Keshchandra, and a ceremonial golden door through which a goddess is said to have passed a sacred sword to Nepali kings at their coronations, providing them with the strength to rule. But others, like the aforementioned crowns, halos and stupas, were surprise finds, as the bulk of objects languished in storerooms covered in thick layers of dust, all but forgotten.\\n   \\n      Records are crucial to protecting and preserving cultural heritage. Without documentation and photographs placing them on site, the looted items found in US museums may never have been returned to Itumbaha. So, after completing its own research, the Rubin offered funding and expertise — at the monastic leaders’ request — to help the vihara establish its own museum.\\n   \\n      “It is our hope that through this collaboration we can create further awareness around the cultural importance of historic collections held in religious institutions like our own and the need to document and protect them,” said Pragya Ji, president of the Ithum Conservation Society, which takes care of the vihara, in a statement announcing its partnership with the Rubin.\\n   \\n      In a phone interview with CNN, executive director of the Rubin Museum, Jorrit Britschgi, said: “It’s so important to prevent future thefts to be able to say: ‘Hey listen, this was in the house collection as of (this) date.’” The Rubin is currently doubling down on efforts to identify other items in its collection with questionable provenance, he added.\\n   \\n      Roshan Mishra, a founding member of the not-for-profit organization Nepal Heritage Recovery Campaign (NHRC), said many relics were looted and removed from Nepal after the country began welcoming overseas visitors (Nepal was a hermetic kingdom, closed to foreigners, until the fall of the Rana dynasty in 1951) and the global art market began valuing its elaborate carvings and statues.\\n   \\n      “In the ‘60s and ‘70s, Nepal was just open. Nobody was even thinking… that (representations of) gods and goddesses would be stolen one day,” said Mishra. “(They were just) part of the culture, part of the community; they were almost like trees, bushes, animals and us.”\\n   \\n      In the decades that followed, heritage protection took a backseat amid political upheaval and a protracted civil war. But now, with the return of relative stability since the war’s end in 2006, Nepalis are taking a closer look at what items went missing.\\n   \\n      Organizations like the NHRC have been at the forefront of efforts to identify objects taken from religious sites across the country. The non-profit has helped identify (often based on photos and tips posted to an anonymously run Facebook page, Lost Arts of Nepal) dozens of objects it believes belong to the country, a number of which have now been recovered.\\n   \\n      For the NHRC, repatriating objects is not just about rebuilding Nepal’s collections — it’s returning the gods to the people and restoring rituals that were once part of everyday life. Many ceremonies and festivals centered around certain relics stopped when they were stolen, putting an end to age-old traditions, Mishra said.\\n   \\n      There’s an element of urgency for the group now, as many of the missing objects were taken several decades ago. “It is very likely that the next generation of people would easily forget the rituals,” said Mishra.\\n   \\n      In this spirit, Itumbaha’s new museum hopes to show how religious artifacts can be presented as living heritage. As a community space where religious rites and rituals take place every day, it’s an “open” museum in which historical objects are sometimes used by the vihara’s members. Bells are rung in ceremonies, for example, while at a festival in August relics were taken out into the courtyards, where locals were allowed to touch and examine them. It’s a departure from most of the world’s museums, where valuable objects are placed in temperature- and humidity-controlled glass cases under high security.\\n   \\n      While this may lead to wear and tear, or even the eventual destruction of precious objects, the museum’s approach reflects the idea that artifacts are part of life — and can even have lives of their own. “We need to allow these objects to live and die with dignity,” Mishra said. “Within the monastery space, or a temple space, they’re constantly touched, right? You pray, you do the ritual around them… you don’t need to think about conservation and preservation when they perform a living tradition.”\\n   \\n      “It’s entirely up to that community what they want to do with these objects, and most of the time they’re (put) back into the temple and shrines, and they will be worshipped,” he added.\\n   \\n      The artifact returned by the Met and the Rubin have now been restored to their original spots and are once again part of Itumbaha’s architecture.\\n   \\n      The project brought together people from across generations to decipher what some of the rediscovered items were used for, according to Kayastha. It unearthed memories and revived interest in the history and traditions of Itumbaha and its Newar Buddhist devotees — something that had previously proven a challenge, she added.\\n   \\n      “For many of the objects, even the community has lost their knowledge (of their functions),” Kayastha said. “They had to make four or five different calls to different people to ask: ‘What is this thing called? What was it used for?’”\\n   \\n      The museum, she said, will always be a work in progress — an open research center to share knowledge and revive lost knowledge. “Nothing is final, nothing is the whole truth, there’s more to be appended over time,” she said.\\n   \\n      Not everyone was happy with the Rubin’s role in financing the project. Nepali heritage activists protested the Itumbaha museum’s opening in July, accusing the Rubin of using the collaboration to launder its public image and deflect calls to scrutinize the provenance of other items in its collection.\\n   \\n      They held placards reading: “Say No to Cultural Invasion,” “Rubin Stop Your Whitewashing” and “Rubin Give Our Gods Back.”\\n   \\n      In an open letter to the Rubin’s director, NHRC chairperson Riddhi Baba Pradhan welcomed the collaboration, but warned that the exhibition “cannot be a way to generate misplaced goodwill nor to divert attention from the responsibility of foreign collectors and museums on the matter of stolen heritage items from Kathmandu Valley and Nepal as a whole.”\\n   \\n      Pradhan also called on the Rubin to help quash the market for stolen cultural objects, which she said “requires committed curators to investigate, report and repatriate.”\\n   \\n      Fellow NHRC member Roshan Mishra meanwhile suggested that Western museums commission local artisans in Nepal, and elsewhere, to create authentic replicas that could be displayed in place of looted objects. Doing so would “clean” their collections while supporting living artists and cultures, he added. He also called for more museums to set up processes to identify and repatriate objects.\\n   \\n      “We don’t have to name and shame institutions (with potentially stolen items in their collections) on social media,” said Mishra, adding: “We can have a conversation… we can figure out how to make these things happen.”\\n  ',\n",

       " {'headline': '\\n      Opinion: A path to peace in Middle East is possible. Here’s how\\n    ',\n",
       "  'contents': ' \\nEditor’s note: Ambassador\\xa0Miriam\\xa0Sapiro is a nonresident senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. She has served at the National Security Council, at the State Department as a negotiator for the Bosnia Peace Accords, and as Deputy US Trade Representative. The opinions expressed in this commentary are her own. Read\\xa0more opinion\\xa0at CNN\\n \\n      The barbaric attack on Israel by Hamas and the violent aftermath are tragic consequences of the failure to find a durable solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\\n   \\n      As the humanitarian crisis deepens and the risk of broader escalation grows, it is imperative to identify a way to move beyond the bloodshed towards an overall settlement, as hard as that may be to imagine.\\n   \\n      What would that path look like, and what issues need to be addressed? As we saw with President Biden’s visit to Israel last week, US leadership will be vital, even if the chances for success may seem slim.\\n   \\n      There’s a template for the way toward Mideast peace: The US played a key role in brokering the peace agreement that ended the war in Bosnia in the 1990s, amid battles over control of territory and evidence of atrocities. I was part of the US team that helped lead those talks. At the time, we did not know if we would succeed, but we knew we had to try.\\n   \\n      The situation in the Balkans in\\xa01995 was bleak. Years of ethnic conflict and sectarian violence among Croatians, Serbs and Bosnians roiled the region following the breakup of Yugoslavia, leaving nearly 100,000 people dead and displacing thousands more.\\n   \\n      Repeated European efforts to forge a peace settlement had failed. UN peacekeepers had been deployed but were reluctant to use force to protect civilians, even after evidence surfaced that Bosnian Serbs had engaged in ethnic cleansing and genocide against Bosnian Muslims.\\n   \\n      The US decided it had to intervene after no other option had worked. Using a combination of aggressive diplomacy and the threat of additional NATO airstrikes against the Bosnian Serbs, Washington coordinated agreement on guiding principles for peace negotiations that took place in Dayton, Ohio.\\n   \\n      The US made sure that each party invited to the talks — Serbia, Croatia and the Bosnian Muslims — understood in no uncertain terms that there would be substantial costs for not cooperating. A similarly firm hand — and robust US leadership — will also be necessary for any peace deal to be forged in the Middle East.\\n   \\n      Every peace negotiation presents uniquely challenging circumstances. But there are aspects of the US experience in Bosnia — beyond extreme highs and lows — that can provide guidance to navigating the current crisis. At Dayton, we refused to deal directly with the top Bosnian Serbs given their\\xa0direct role in atrocities, and\\xa0their\\xa0interests were represented by Belgrade. Similarly, Hamas’ current leadership would certainly not be welcome at the table should Mideast peace talks resume.\\n   \\n      In Bosnia, we developed strong incentives for each party to reach a deal, as well as disincentives for failure. The same will be necessary for any future negotiations in the Middle East. For the Palestinians, for example, encouragement could include real reconstruction of Gaza, laying infrastructure in both Gaza and the West Bank, and greater access within the West Bank as well as road links to Gaza.\\n   \\n      We also worked hard to involve European, Arab and other countries that had a stake in stabilizing the Balkans and that would need to provide tangible support for reconstruction, training and integration. For any talks on Mideast peace, it will be just as crucial to identify important roles for Israel’s neighbors and the broader international community. This should include testing the willingness of Saudi Arabia to recognize Israel. Indeed, one major motive for Hamas’ attack appears to have been its aim to derail normalization.\\n   \\n      The United States will clearly need to galvanize a regional coalition in the Middle East, much as it did with the Bosnia Contact Group that\\xa0kept the EU and major European powers in sync with the pace of American-led efforts to end that war.\\n   \\n      In addition to the United States and Israel, such a Mideast contact group could include at its core Egypt and Jordan, as well as the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Saudi Arabia. Qatar, which is helping to mediate the return of additional hostages and has helped in other ways, could be offered a role provided it acts constructively.\\n   \\n      It remains to be seen if the Hamas attack will serve as a warning to the United States as it struggles to address internal tensions and remain a reliable international partner. As preoccupied as America is with growing domestic polarization, it is the country that former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and others have called\\xa0the “indispensable nation” — and for good reason, as Bosnia demonstrated.\\n   \\n      Concrete prospects for renewing peace efforts in the Middle East will depend on several interrelated issues, including the extent to which Israel can dismantle Hamas’ infrastructure while maintaining support for its actions from its regional partners and the US.\\n   \\n      Whether Israel will be able to achieve its objective of destroying Hamas, and in what timeframe, is not yet clear. The longer the war in Gaza lasts, the greater the risk that Israel will lose some of the regional and international support that is essential to isolating Hamas, financially, militarily and politically.\\n   \\n      Of course,\\xa0given the threat that\\xa0Iran and groups like the Muslim Brotherhood pose to Egyptian and Gulf interests, these countries have as much to fear from a powerful Hamas as Israel. That should compel them to help increase isolation of Hamas as well as play an active and useful role in future peace talks.\\n   \\n      To maintain international support, but also as a matter of moral imperative, Israel must demonstrate that it is doing all that it can to uphold international humanitarian law, even as it wrestles with an enemy that places military assets\\xa0near civilian hospitals, schools and mosques\\xa0and that then\\xa0discourages civilians\\xa0from fleeing to safer ground. The\\xa0urgency of getting aid into Gaza\\xa0and taking all steps possible to minimize civilian casualties is clear.\\n   \\n      Successful negotiations will also depend upon what kind of leadership emerges in Israel. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s right-wing coalition\\xa0was never going to embrace the two-state solution\\xa0envisioned in the Oslo Accords. It was preoccupied with building thousands of new settlements\\xa0in the West Bank at the expense of Palestinian moderates and economic cooperation among Ramallah, Israel and the broader region.\\n   \\n      A greater role in setting policy is critical for Israeli voices that believe there is no viable alternative to a comprehensive peace settlement.\\xa0And the question of who will represent the Palestinians is equally important. It is time to take a hard look at concrete ways to bolster Palestinians who still seek peace and encourage the emergence of new leaders.\\n   \\n      The Palestinian Authority suffers from a myriad of problems but these do not diminish the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people— like Israelis, like Americans — to live in peace, with security and dignity. Israel, the United States, the European Union\\xa0 and — importantly — the Gulf states must do more in a coordinated way to address corruption, create economic opportunity and build the local Palestinian institutions needed for successful governance, not only in the West Bank but ultimately in Gaza. Otherwise there will be a political vacuum that the next iteration of Hamas, with\\xa0Iran’s backing, will exploit.\\n   \\n      A strong US commitment to negotiations, coupled with tangible support from regional players to fight Hamas and to build an effective Palestinian Authority, as well as the emergence of Israeli and Palestinian leaders who do support a two-state solution, provide hope that this terrible phase could sow the seeds for a better future.\\n   \\n      With the key players thinking strategically and acting tactically — as eventually happened in Bosnia — peace in the Middle East may have a chance.\\n  ',\n",

       "  'contents': ' \\n  Editor’s Note: Charles Dunne is a former US Foreign Service officer. He is a nonresident fellow at the Arab Center Washington DC and a nonresident scholar at the Middle East Institute. He teaches\\xa0at the Elliott School of International Affairs at George Washington University.\\xa0The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View\\xa0more opinion\\xa0at CNN.\\n \\nThis piece has been updated to reflect news developments.\\n \\n      A total of\\xa021 US military personnel\\xa0have sustained injuries after coming\\xa0under attack 13 times\\xa0by aerial drones and rockets on\\xa0bases in Iraq and Syria last week,\\xa0defense officials\\xa0told CNN on Wednesday. The injuries might be minor, but the statement behind them isn’t:\\xa0The threat of a broader conflict, possibly involving US forces, is growing almost daily following the gruesome October 7 terrorist attacks on southern Israel by Hamas, the Iranian-supported militant group.\\n   \\n      Indeed, US troops in these locations have often been attacked by Iranian proxy forces at times of rising tension, and Washington, which believes Tehran has been “actively facilitating” these latest attacks, is bracing for a surge.\\xa0Fresh\\xa0US airstrikes\\xa0against\\xa0Iran-backed militia\\xa0targets in Syria on Thursday show\\xa0the United States is not backing\\xa0back down from this fight, and a sharper intensification\\xa0appears likely. However, the White House has, for the moment, rightly stopped short of concluding that a major escalation is inevitable.\\n   \\n      National Security Council spokesman John Kirby\\xa0told reporters\\xa0on Monday that the US is “deeply concerned about the potential for any significant escalation of these attacks in the days ahead,” and is positioning additional air defense forces,\\xa0two aircraft carrier strike groups and\\xa0some 900 additional troops\\xa0in the region as a deterrent.\\xa0President Joe Biden\\xa0himself has issued a starkly simple warning for any country or group that\\xa0might be looking to stir up more trouble: “Don’t.”\\n   \\n      That posture is about right: stern warnings\\xa0backed by a defensive buildup, which allows the US to make possible strikes against discrete targets if the origins of the attacks\\xa0can be identified in real time. The US should also make clear it retains the option to hit\\xa0the\\xa0facilities\\xa0of Iran-backed militias\\xa0responsible\\xa0in Syria and Iraq, as it did in 2021. While this risks escalation, it might be necessary\\xa0—\\xa0and a lack of resolve is also a risk in the face of ongoing attacks.\\n   \\n      In important respects, the Middle East of the moment resembles Europe on the eve of World War I, in which entangling alliances and secret commitments pushed a cascade of combatants to tumble together into war after the first shot was fired in Sarajevo.\\n   \\n      There is a history here that goes beyond the fact that the US is allied with and supporting Israel in its war on Hamas. Iran and the US have been on the brink of open conflict since early 2020 when the US\\xa0assassinated\\xa0the notorious commander of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards (IRGC) Qods Force, Qassem Soleimani, the man widely believed responsible for\\xa0enabling attacks against American troops throughout the region.\\n   \\n      Iran has a long memory, and earlier this year\\xa0renewed\\xa0its call for revenge. For months Tehran apparently has been planning a\\xa0more aggressive strategy\\xa0aimed at US troops in the region.\\n   \\n      Last February, Reuters reported that Iran used earthquake relief flights to Syria\\xa0as a cover\\xa0for secret weapons shipments, and The Washington Post reported that\\xa0documents\\xa0leaked as part of the\\xa0Discord trove\\xa0revealed plans by the IRGC Qods Force to equip and train militias with devastating\\xa0advanced IEDs.\\n   \\n      All this may be part of an effort coordinated among Russia, Iran and Syrian dictator\\xa0Bashar al-Assad to expel the\\xa0900 US troops in Syria, who are there to counter the Islamic State. The\\xa02,500 American troops\\xa0still in Iraq on an\\xa0advise-and-assist mission\\xa0will also present tempting targets.\\n   \\n      That means at the very least that\\xa0Iran is well-positioned to heighten already roiling tensions in the Middle East after spending decades\\xa0building a network of proxies and terror cells in Lebanon, Gaza, Iraq, Yemen and elsewhere to act as a forward line of defense for a clerical regime that sees itself as surrounded by external threats. Most important\\xa0—\\xa0especially in the case of Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in southern Lebanon\\xa0—\\xa0these furnish a direct front and capable forces in the armed fight for Israel’s destruction.\\n   \\n      But there’s also a deeper question of what exactly Iran did to bring about this crisis in the first place with the October 7 attacks\\xa0—\\xa0and what that says about where it goes from here.\\n   \\n      In Gaza, Iran has helped transform and expand the capabilities of Hamas (and its smaller cousin,\\xa0Palestinian Islamic Jihad, also involved in the recent attacks on Israel) almost since the group’s inception in 1987. Tehran has supplied a wide array of\\xa0rockets, missiles\\xa0and\\xa0other weapons, while Israeli intelligence has assessed that it manages a\\xa0sophisticated and complicated ratline\\xa0smuggling weaponry from Iran to Yemen to Sudan by sea, to Egypt by truck, through the Sinai courtesy of Bedouin smugglers, and from there into Gaza via Hamas’ extensive network of cross-border tunnels.\\xa0In addition, Iran has\\xa0provided Hamas up to $100 million\\xa0annually, according to a 2021 State Department report.\\n   \\n      Given that largess, some Biden opponents have charged that the $6 billion in\\xa0embargoed oil sales\\xa0“released” to Iran in exchange for\\xa0freeing five American hostages\\xa0in September played a role in financing the Hamas attack. But the\\xa0funds are held in an account\\xa0controlled by Qatar and carefully monitored for humanitarian purposes, and none of those funds (now frozen) had been released at the time of the attack.\\n   \\n      It’s also important to note that Iran has never been at a loss for funds to support its clients, notwithstanding internationally frozen assets, heavy international sanctions and abiding economic problems. Ironically, such spending is controversial even in Iran itself; revelations concerning the substantial billions Iran spends on foreign adventurism helped fuel anti-government protests in 2018.\\n   \\n      There has been much speculation about whether, given these well-documented ties, Iran ordered the Hamas operation in southern Israel. The White House has tentatively concluded that while Tehran has provided material assistance that could facilitate such an operation, it has\\xa0no information\\xa0to suggest that Iran did so.\\n   \\n      Despite a story in The Wall Street Journal of Hamas sources claiming\\xa0Iran helped plan the attack,\\xa0there is no analytical unanimity, and no firm public evidence, verifying this report. Other intelligence reported in the WSJ that Hamas militants recently received\\xa0some specialized training in Iran hasn’t been linked specifically to the\\xa0October 7 attacks.\\n   \\n      While\\xa0Iran shares an anti-Israel agenda with Hamas, many\\xa0experts assess\\xa0it has never had the ability to control it and doesn’t require prior authorization for its activities. It is reasonable to assume, as the US has said, that\\xa0Iran was surprised\\xa0(albeit\\xa0pleased) with the October 7 operations.\\n   \\n      All of which is consistent with the fact that neither Iran nor Hezbollah appear to have committed to more intensive involvement — yet Iran is reportedly fearful of a harsh response\\xa0if it crosses Israel’s red lines. Meanwhile, Hezbollah’s\\xa0probing attacks\\xa0in Israel’s north over the past two weeks may be intended as signs of solidarity with Hamas and to keep Israel distracted from Gaza. And while the Iran-allied Houthis in Yemen have\\xa0fired shots\\xa0at Israel in recent days, they haven’t yet posed a serious threat to the Jewish state.\\n   \\n      Still, Iran and its allies have their\\xa0red lines, too. Iran-backed forces in Iraq and the Houthis in Yemen have\\xa0both threatened\\xa0American targets if the US intervenes; Iran has warned against Israeli strikes on Iranian soil; and\\xa0Hezbollah has hinted\\xa0that any attempt by Israel to eliminate Hamas would be met with a major response.\\n   \\n      The situation could tip in a number of directions depending on the smallest actions, and even the domestic considerations, of the parties. For example, the alleged beating-induced coma in Iran of 16-year-old\\xa0Armita Geravand\\xa0for refusing to comply with Islamic dress laws earlier this month recalls the\\xa0dramatic nationwide demonstrations\\xa0against the morality police last year that authorities were hard pressed to put down. If a distraction is needed, could Iran’s clerical leaders look to a dramatic foreign crisis?\\n   \\n      Miscalculations — whether by Iran, Israel, Hezbollah or even the US — could rapidly lead to a multifront regional war with casualties easily numbering in the tens of thousands. None of the\\xa0major parties involved appears to have a compelling strategy to address the long-term dangers. The key players might benefit from a pause for reflection, before it’s too late.\\n  ',\n",

       "  'contents': ' \\nEditor’s note: Abood Okal, who spent part of his childhood in Gaza, lives in Massachusetts. The views in this commentary are his own. Read more opinion at CNN.\\n \\n      It started out as a family vacation. Abood Okal, 36, traveled to Gaza in late September with his wife Wafa Abuzayda and their 1-year-old son Yousef to visit relatives they hadn’t seen in years.\\n   \\n      Now, they and several other family members — most of whom have US citizenship — are stranded in Gaza, unable to get out and fearful that they could lose their lives at any time as Israeli airstrikes in the region intensify.\\n   \\n      Okal, a cancer researcher for a Massachusetts pharmaceutical company, is one of about 500 to 600 dual nationals and US permanent residents trapped in Gaza and hoping to be evacuated or to be allowed to exit Gaza by crossing the border into Egypt.\\n   \\n      For decades, his family’s home has been in northern Gaza, but the constant bombardment, and Israeli orders to evacuate, led them to flee. Now a couple dozen family and friends are holed up in a borrowed house in southern Gaza, hoping to make their way across the Egyptian border at the first opportunity.\\n   \\n      Each day, Okal faces the challenge of figuring out how to find food for his extended family amid dwindling provisions available at local shops in southern Gaza, while navigating streets rendered all but impassable after being struck by Israeli bombs.\\n   \\n      He says that never far from mind is the risk of fresh shelling that could strike his household at any time, as Israel continues a bombing campaign in Gaza that already has claimed thousands of lives, according to the Hamas-controlled Palestinian Health Ministry in Gaza. He also worries about a possible Israeli invasion, which he fears could make it even harder for his family to get to Egypt.\\n   \\n      The brutal Hamas attacks on October 7 precipitated an Israeli military response, with the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) ordering Gazans to relocate to the South as it bombarded suspected Hamas strongholds and prepared for a possible ground invasion.\\n   \\n      Okal says he reaches out to the State Department every day looking for news about a plan for when Palestinian Americans like him will be evacuated. Days into his prolonged Gaza stay, he says, he has received no clear guidance from US officials.\\n   \\n      Meanwhile, the White House said this week that it’s considering contingency plans to evacuate Americans from the Middle East. White House national security spokesman John Kirby said the US is “thinking through a broad range of contingencies and possibilities, and certainly evacuations are one of those things. We’re not at the point of execution right now.”\\n   \\nKirby added that “obviously a prime focus for us is the several hundred Americans that we know are there.”\\n   \\n      Okal spoke by phone with CNN Opinion editor Stephanie Griffith. Their conversation has been condensed and edited for clarity.\\n   \\nCNN: What actually took you to Gaza at this point in time?\\n \\nOkal: We left our home in Massachusetts on September 25 for what was supposed to be one month of vacation. We spent the first week of our trip in the West Bank, and then we went to Gaza for what was supposed to be another two weeks of vacation. Then we were supposed to spend another week visiting different cities in Israel and the West Bank because we wanted to explore some of the tourist areas and cities.\\n   \\n      My wife and I have a 1-year-old. We hadn’t been to Gaza for almost six years. We said, okay, let’s go visit some relatives. We said, we should introduce our son to his cousins, uncles and aunts. We were in Gaza for about a week when the [bombing] started, and we’ve been stranded here ever since.\\n   \\nCNN: So several days into what was supposed to be your family vacation, the Israeli bombing of Gaza started?\\n \\nOkal: Yes, when the war started on that Saturday, my wife and I immediately jumped on the phone with the State Department trying to figure out what our best options were to leave. We wanted to get out as soon as possible to protect our lives, but also for our son’s sake — we didn’t want him to live through the trauma. And so, my wife immediately packed our stuff and went to her parents’ house — the area where they live is a little bit safer than where my parents’ house is, where we had been staying.\\n   \\n      We were at my wife’s parents house a couple of days into the war when there was an airstrike about 100 feet from my parents’ house. It basically knocked all the doors out of their frame and shattered glass everywhere. That’s when my parents joined me and my wife at her parents’ house. We all huddled together until we had to leave northern Gaza and head south. As a family, we’ve decided we would live together or die together.\\n   \\nCNN: Tell me about your family in the region. Who are they, and where are they?\\n \\n      Half of us — or half of my siblings — are in the US and the other half are actually in Palestine. We are a family of eight. Four boys, four girls and we’re also split equally in half of those who are in Gaza versus those that are outside of Gaza. A brother and a sister in the US happen to be in New Jersey. And then my other older sister, she’s actually in Ramallah in the West Bank. That’s part of why we were visiting the West Bank at the beginning of our trip. And then I have two brothers and two sisters that live in Gaza.\\n   \\n      My parents are also dual citizens just like their kids. My parents actually live in northern Gaza. And my wife’s parents are between northern Gaza and Gaza City itself. But to be clear: We all fled northern Gaza not just because of the bombings, but because the IDF announced that all residents of Gaza City must immediately move south of Gaza Valley — otherwise, they might be killed during the bombing campaign.\\n   \\nCNN: Is everybody in your family considering leaving Gaza now and coming to the US?\\xa0\\n \\nOkal: That’s the plan. I think anyone who has an opportunity to leave will do so, because of the magnitude of damage and suffering that we’re seeing, which is just unthinkable. And so far, we’ve only lived through phase one [of Israeli assaults on Gaza.] Based on what we hear from news reports, the Israeli military’s phase two will be its ground invasion. Presumably, that will only make things worse.\\n   \\nCNN: After the explosion near your parents’ home in northern Gaza, you succeeded in calling the State Department. And what did they tell you?\\n \\nOkal: The very first few hours they said it’s a very dynamic and fluid situation and that they didn’t have any idea about what’s really happening. But they took our passport numbers, phone numbers, email addresses and made us register through the State Department’s STEP program, which kind of tracks you if you’re traveling overseas for urgent notification. So, we did all that and then we called again and again. We were told each time that there was no new information.\\n   \\n      Ever since, we call every single day, not missing even a single day. On certain days, I have called four or five different times. Sometimes we have switched between calling the US embassy in Jerusalem and the embassy in Cairo. As the days went on, the State Department in Washington, DC, even got involved. Now there are so many numbers for us to track. We call all of them all the time. All they tell us is, “The situation is dynamic. Stay as safe as you can. We’re working on an evacuation plan.”\\n   \\n      Early in the war, we were told by the State Department: If you can make it to the crossing, and you think it’s safe, go there. And you should be able to cross into Egypt. On Saturday, they told us that the Rafah crossing would be open and that we should head there if we deem it to be safe to do so. Nothing happened.\\n   \\n      It was the third time that based on what the State Department told us — we spent eight to 10 hours standing outside in the heat — nothing happened. And while we were waiting there, we all would call the State Department, we would call the embassy in Cairo. And all they would say is, “We don’t have any information.”\\n   \\n      Listen, we live in northern Gaza. We were not asking for a full-fledged, secure path from Gaza City in the North all the way to the South. We were willing to take that risk. All we want is the guarantee that once we make it to the Egyptian border, we will be able to cross. Yet, nobody in the State Department was able to confirm that for us.\\n   \\n      Luckily, where we’re staying right now is less than 10 minutes from the Egyptian border. We could be there in minutes. But like I said, we were told three times since we’ve been here in southern Gaza to go to the border by the State Department and every single time, we were not able to cross, despite spending all day there.\\n   \\nCNN: That must be immensely frustrating. You’ve said you have the impression that there’s a greater level of urgency in getting US citizens or dual nationals out of Israel, compared to what the US government is doing for Palestinian Americans.\\n \\nOkal: No doubt about it. We see firsthand the amount of logistics that are being put in place to get Americans out of Israel, even though I don’t think anyone would disagree that the amount of risk exposure for Americans in Gaza is much greater than for American citizens in Israel.\\n   \\nCNN:. To what do you attribute the different treatment?\\n \\nOkal: I don’t have an explanation for that. I can try to postulate, and it certainly would drive me down a path that I would not like to believe that an American would be treated differently from another American just based on where they are located. So, I still give the benefit of the doubt that there isn’t any type of discriminatory treatment for an American in Gaza versus an American in Israel. But the reality is we see that there is a different level of effort invested in extracting an American citizen out of Israel compared to Gaza.\\n   \\nCNN: You said you’ve been monitoring news sources regarding updates on the border crossing. What news sources are those?\\xa0\\n \\nOkal: In the past 10 days, I would say since everybody started heading south, there is a complete lack of news. The networks are down for both power and internet. We haven’t had internet where we’re staying for the last several days because the network has been blown out. So we rely on cell phone signals, basically internet via the cell phone provider because we have this US number that we use as roaming.\\n   \\n      At the place where we are staying, we have power for just about an hour or two using solar panels. We’re fortunate enough to have that where we’re staying so we can charge our devices. That’s how we get our news — from our phones.\\n   \\n      Also, one of my very best friends in the US lives a mile away from us [in Massachusetts]. We used to work together in Cambridge. He follows the news about this region. I told him, “Hey, if there’s anything about the border crossing or about a ground invasion, then please text me right away. Because it takes time for us to get the news here. It’s kind of ironic that I’m getting my news about Gaza out of Massachusetts.\\n   \\nCNN: Some of that news, as you say, deals with the potential for a ground invasion by Israel. How concerned are you about that?\\xa0\\n \\nOkal: That’s my nightmare. I think it’s going to be nasty and it’s going to be very destructive, based on what the Israeli military spokespeople are saying. We’re terrified because where my parents were before we fled south was an area that’s near the northeastern border of Gaza. So, in a matter of minutes of a ground invasion, the tanks would be rolling next to where my parents’ homes are. We’re terrified because we know that our lives will be at even a greater risk.\\n   \\n      That’s part of why we’re trying to exit Gaza as fast as possible. We’re trying to flee as fast as we can while we still can — before the invasion starts. That is when curfews will happen. You literally wouldn’t be able to move depending on where you are moving. I probably wouldn’t be able to even step outside right now to make this phone call. The invasion will be a huge nightmare if we are still in Gaza when it starts.\\n   \\nCNN: What is the house that you’re living in now? How did you find it? I mean, it sounded like mission impossible when Israel ordered more than a million Gazans to leave the North and go south.\\n \\nOkal: Basically, we were lucky, because this house belongs to a friend of my wife’s dad — basically a friend of a friend of a friend. They’re out of town and they said, yes, you’re welcome to stay at it. The keys are with the neighbors.\\n   \\n      So, we came and stayed here. Right now, we’re a total of 40 people. My family makes up 25 people: basically myself, my wife and our son, her parents, my parents, my brother, his wife and his twin daughters, my sister and her three children, my wife’s two uncles and their families.\\n   \\n      It’s kind of like my entire immediate and closest circle of family because everyone’s fleeing for their lives. And we’re huddled on the first floor. Then on the second floor, the owners of the house have their relatives that are escaping northern Gaza. So, 40 people in total, in a single-family home.\\n   \\nCNN: What do you think is going to become of Gaza?\\n \\nOkal: I don’t know, but it already is no longer the Gaza that I knew before leaving 17 years ago and moving to the US. Entire neighborhoods in the center of Gaza City have been taken out. There were major landmarks that everybody would know are gone. You’re talking about 1.1 million people who have fled south. My parents have the feeling — and my wife’s parents do as well — that they will never see their homes again, even though it’s about a 10-mile drive north of here. I won’t be going back, and I can’t imagine that anyone I know will be back. The amount of destruction there is just unthinkable.\\n   \\nCNN: And all 25 of your relatives are going to try to get the State Department to arrange their passage into Egypt?\\n \\nOkal: We wish. Not all of them are American citizens. We’ve been told by the State Department transit will be allowed for Americans and their immediate relatives, meaning spouse and children if they’re not American. That’s the heartbreaking part: that while we’re trying as hard as we can to leave, we know we will be leaving family and loved ones behind.\\n  ',\n",

       " {'headline': '\\n      Opinion: Lewiston is a community fighting for its light\\n    ',\n",
       "  'contents': ' \\n  Editor’s Note: Amy Bass (@bassab1) is professor of sport studies at\\xa0Manhattanville College\\xa0and the author of “One Goal: A Coach, a Team, and the Game That Brought a Divided Town Together” and “Not the Triumph but the Struggle: The 1968 Olympics and the Making of the Black Athlete,” among other titles. The views expressed here are solely hers. Read more\\xa0opinion\\xa0on CNN.\\n \\n      I thought about Lewiston, Maine, all day on Wednesday.\\xa0The Lewiston High School boys soccer team, the Blue Devils, the center of my book “One Goal,” had a 5pm quarterfinal game against Farmington’s Mt. Blue on Lewiston’s Don Roux field.\\xa0Since I couldn’t be there, I had to rely on the play-by-play results that the school’s athletic director, Jason Fuller, provides via X (formerly Twitter).\\n \\n      Of course\\xa0I had no idea what was to\\xa0follow that night, when at least 18 people were killed and over a dozen were injured in mass shootings at a local restaurant and bowling alley. No one could have known that was to come. During the day, I was only stressed about the game, worried because just last week, I was in Maine and saw the team lose, which they —\\xa0recently ranked 14th in the nation\\xa0— don’t do very often.\\n   \\n      Lewiston, Maine’s second most-populous city, is a place that once saw its best days in the rearview mirror, a city that has fought hard to find its light. Its story is one of transition, from its former heyday as “Spindle City,” a textile center with factory jobs that brought an influx of French-speaking Canadian immigrants to its triple-decker Italianate-style apartment houses, to its increasingly global landscape, created in large part by the thousands of Somalis who migrated there at the turn of the 21st century, immigrants who carved space for themselves amongst Quebecois culture.\\n   \\n      In short?\\xa0Lewiston is a hardscrabble hockey town that made room for soccer, a place that understands the meaning and worth of community and the work that goes into making a city into home.\\n   \\n      I had been in town for a short residency at Bates College, my alma mater, the reason I first lived in Lewiston as a temporary resident. As always, I centered my trip around high school soccer, and purposely scheduled the visit around the “Battle of the Bridge” game — Lewiston versus Edward Little, which sits just across the Androscoggin River in Auburn, the other half of Maine’s twin cities, in southwest Maine, north of Portland.\\n   \\n      New England never pays much attention to weather forecasts, so despite the best predictions otherwise, it poured. But I was there with Mike McGraw, the now-retired coach of Lewiston soccer who brought the team to its first state championship title in 2015 with a roster in which all but one of the starters was an African refugee.\\xa0We climbed to the top of the bleachers, where McGraw used his own coat to wipe a spot dry for me. We enjoyed a passionate and action-packed match between the two rivals, a game made all the more fun because the players know each other so well, as soccer moves freely back and forth across the river, often transcending the mascots and colors that come with high school life.\\n   \\n      Lewiston lost.\\xa0 But it was a delightful evening, seeing former players and friends who had come out to support the team, to support Dan Gish, who had taken the reins as head coach from McGraw a few years ago, to support the game, and — most importantly — to support the community.\\xa0 The evening finished over a few pitchers of beer at the Blue Goose, a Lewiston institution in the middle of downtown where McGraw has held court since his 21st birthday in 1970.\\n   \\n      Wednesday’s game was a different story in every way.\\xa0On the pitch, a tense, scoreless game under a fading cotton candy sky went into overtime, until Mohammed Gabow got his head on captain Obed Antonio’s corner kick to give the Blue Devils the 1-0 win. That victory sent them to the semifinals,\\xa0a home game scheduled for this Saturday at 2pm\\n \\n      It felt good. But then as news bulletins began to emerge about a shooting spree in Lewiston, everything changed.\\n   \\n      “We went from a playoff overtime win to realizing what really matters in life,” Gish told me Thursday morning.\\xa0 “My wife [the principal at Geiger Elementary School in Lewiston] called me as she was going home from parent teacher conferences; she was stopped immediately by an officer and told to get out of there fast. I was thinking about going to watch the rest of the Edward Little game but instead got home to my family. Checked on my mother. Texted my captains and coaches to make sure they were okay.”\\n   \\n      Edward Little’s quarterfinal game, tied 2-2 with Topsham’s Mount Ararat High School,\\xa0was suspended before overtime began, county officials’ shelter in place and lockdown orders sending folks home.\\n   \\n      “The more time goes on, we realize the connections we have to the people who lost their lives,” Gish\\xa0told me.\\xa0 “I want to see my soccer family and give them a big hug and tell them it’s going to be okay. We have so much to play for.”\\n   \\n      So, while Republican Rep. Lauren Boebert might send her prayers to\\xa0(a misspelled)“Lewistown”\\xa0and much needed debates about guns and the NRA and regulation and legislation undoubtedly will take place, likely to no avail, right now Lewiston needs to find its light amidst unspeakable darkness.\\xa0We all know places like Lewiston, places where everyone is connected in some way, whether through soccer or something else.\\xa0As my social media feeds changed from those marking themselves “safe” to those looking for information about a loved one who didn’t come home, I turned to McGraw, as always, for the last word on the community.\\n   \\n      “I’ve read more than several posts from people that say that Lewiston is a good place to live,” he said. “The city is strong. People are looking out for each other.”\\n   \\n      Go ya’ Big Blue.\\n  ',\n",

       " {'headline': '\\n      Opinion: If only Trump’s Mandela comparison were the most outrageous thing he’s said\\n    ',\n",
       "  'contents': ' \\n      This week, at a campaign stop in New Hampshire, former President\\xa0Donald Trump\\xa0compared himself to Nelson Mandela.\\n   \\n      Yes, the man who was born into a wealthy family and whose companies still managed to declare\\xa0multiple bankruptcies,\\xa0who has been accused of acts of\\xa0sexual harassment\\xa0and abuse, who stoked\\xa0racial and ethnic division, who tried to dismantle American administrative and\\xa0democratic systems\\xa0and norms every chance he got, and who currently faces charges on\\xa091 crimes\\xa0across several jurisdictions, compared himself to\\xa0a man who risked his life\\xa0to end apartheid and establish democratic rule in South Africa, eventually becoming the country’s first Black president and a global icon for all of those who believe in equality and democracy.\\xa0(Trump has denied wrongdoing in the accusations against him.)\\n   \\n      It doesn’t take a whole lot of historical knowledge to know that Trump is no Nelson Mandela. And anyone who has the gall and the gargantuan ego to compare themselves to Nelson Mandela is probably no Nelson Mandela.\\n   \\n      For any other president,\\xa0hyper-narcissistic comments\\xa0like this would be a major liability. For Trump, they’re the norm — and his followers, disturbingly,\\xa0seem to eat it up.\\n   \\n      Trump made the Mandela comparison because he is facing so many criminal charges, which he says are politically motivated. “I don’t mind being Nelson Mandela, because I’m doing it for a reason,” he told his\\xa0New Hampshire audience. Mandela, of course, was jailed for his pro-democracy activism; he fought one of the most brutally racist regimes in the world and was a political prisoner for 27 years. He won the presidency in South Africa’s first ever free, fair, democratic election.\\n   \\n      Trump, by contrast,\\xa0faces charges\\xa0related to attempting to overturn a free and fair democratic election. Some of his former allies are set to testify against him, and some have\\xa0pleaded guilty\\xa0to save themselves\\xa0from\\xa0even harsher potential outcomes. This week, Trump’s former attorney and “fixer”\\xa0Michael Cohen\\xa0is set to testify in Trump’s civil fraud trial.\\xa0Three of his former lawyers have pleaded guilty to crimes related to efforts to overturn the 2020 election.\\n   \\n      That isn’t exactly the biography of a pro-democracy national hero fighting a violent system of enforced racial segregation.\\n   \\n      Nor has Trump behaved in any way that could be described as “statesmanlike” since leaving office. He has continued to perpetuate the big lie that the 2020 election was stolen, a flatly false claim that stokes his ego and inflamed his base, but badly undermines\\xa0public confidence\\xa0in American democratic functioning.\\n   \\n      Contrasting Trump with former President\\xa0Barack Obama\\xa0is instructive: while Obama has used his platform to cheer for America and make measured, thoughtful statements in times of\\xa0global crisis, Trump has used his to insult Americans he believes have wronged\\xa0him and to issue absolutely unhinged missives.\\n   \\n      In the aftermath of Hamas’ horrific terrorist attack on Israeli civilians and Israel’s subsequent devastating war in Gaza, Obama\\xa0issued a statement condemning Hamas, empathizing with Israelis, reasserting Israel’s right to defend itself and urging Israel to protect as many innocent Palestinian lives as possible.\\n   \\n      Initially, the former president lashed out at Benjamin Netanyahu, saying the Israeli prime minister was caught unprepared by Hamas’ attack and called Hezbollah terrorists “very smart.” But after facing wide criticism, even among his party, Trump has said he stands with Israel and has vowed to bring back his infamous travel ban and extend it to include people from the Palestinian territory of Gaza.\\n   \\n      The former president is, at this point, notorious for making comments that run the gamut from offensive to delusional to obviously false to disturbingly grandiose to profoundly dehumanizing.\\n   \\n      In 2020, enough Americans were sick of him to boot him from the White House. His base of loyal, almost cult-like supporters, though, continue to rally behind him, seemingly determined to prove\\xa0Trump’s claim\\xa0that he “could stand in the middle of 5th\\xa0Avenue and shoot somebody and [he] wouldn’t lose voters.”\\n   \\n      Comparing himself to Mandela is unhinged, egomaniacal and outrageous, but it’s also far from the most absurd thing this president has ever said. And it very well might not lose him even one voter.\\xa0\\xa0But it does, again, show just how troublingly tolerant a vast swath of the US electorate is of a man who has repeatedly demonstrated he cares about himself (and his own wealth and his own power) more than anything else — and at the expense of the nation.\\n   \\n      It is not good for a country to have a malignant narcissist in charge. It is not good to have a president who chooses\\xa0self-aggrandizement and self-pity over statesmanship. It’s a shame that so much of America didn’t learn that lesson the first time around.\\n  ',\n",

Mike Johnson in the House, coupled with the fall of former Vice President Mike Pence and the dominance of ex-President Donald Trump, shows that 2020 election denialism is a prerequisite for winning Republican power.\\n   \\n      Johnson, who played a leading role in the effort to block the certification of President Joe Biden’s 2020 election win, benefited in his ascent to the speakership last week from the approval of pro-Trump lawmakers.\\n   \\n      Pence suspended his run for the White House over the weekend after months mired in the single digits in surveys. His tortured explanations of his constitutionality correct decision – that he lacked power to overturn Biden’s 2020 election win in Congress – failed to convince grassroots Republicans bought into the ex-president’s false claims that he won the election. Pence now joins the swelling ranks of Republicans, from former Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney to retiring Utah Sen.

Over the weekend, the former president stepped up his social media rants at the judge presiding over a fraud trial in New York that targets him, his adult sons and his company, after he was fined for a second time last week for breaching a gag order by apparently attacking court personnel on social media.\\n   \\n      The trial – and Trump’s attempt to fight the case in the court of public opinion with inflammatory commentary – is a prelude to an unprecedented election year, with the runaway GOP front-runner facing four criminal trials and the possibility he could be a convicted felon by Election Day in November 2024. In one of those criminal matters – the federal election subversion case – the judge on Sunday reinstated the gag order against him, denying his request to pause it while his appeal played out.\\n   \\n      Trump’s mood is unlikely to improve in the coming week with his adult children expected to be called to testify in the New York civil case. Given that the judge has already ruled the Trump Organization committed fraud, the ex-president is presenting the civil prosecution as an attempt to wreck his 2024 aspirations. He, for instance, warned in a fundraising email earlier this month that the trial in New York was “a way to keep him off the campaign trail and to threaten him with the ‘corporate death penalty’ if he chooses to continue his campaign for president.” The claim was false, but it is likely to be accepted by Trump’s most committed supporters.\\n   \\n      The failure of Pence’s campaign says as much about a brand of Republicanism that may be gone forever as it does his own political skills.\\n   \\n      The former vice president’s campaign was a bid to drag the GOP back to its pre-Trump era. He offered social conservatism, traditional hardline fiscal policies and internationalism through strength in foreign policy that contrasted with his former boss’ fawning toward autocrats like Russian President Vladimir Putin.\\n   \\n      But his failure to even reach the Iowa caucuses – the first GOP nominating contest in January – shows that a party still in thrall to Trump is unwilling to hear the truth about the 2020 election and may have turned against Ronald Reagan-style Republicanism for good. As he futilely trekked through early voting states, confronting false perceptions about his power to block the result of the 2020 election, Pence seemed to be trying to win over a party that no longer existed. He told CNN in August, for instance, that he had no right to reject or return slates of electoral votes back to the states and that “by God’s grace, I did my duty under the Constitution of the United States.”\\n   \\n      But the former vice president, who tried to claim credit for popular aspects of Trump’s presidency while escaping fury over his role in certifying the election in Congress, discovered that Trump is more popular than truth in the modern GOP. The wonder was it took him so long to conclude his campaign was hopeless. Adding to Pence’s humiliation, Trump said his former number two should endorse him — even though he ran a campaign that repudiated the ex-president’s populism.\\n   \\n      Despite his low standing in polls, Pence is the most high-profile Republican candidate to abandon a 2024 presidential campaign so far. His departure may marginally boost the hopes of other contenders vying to become the alternative to Trump before voting opens in January.\\n   \\n      “It just means this race is narrowing, which everyone said that it would,” former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie told CNN’s Jake Tapper on “State of the Union” on Sunday.\\xa0“It never goes as fast as some folks would like, but it is narrowing.” The long-shot 2024 hopeful added: “I’m going to be ready to take on Donald Trump when people actually do start to vote in New Hampshire in particular.”\\n   \\n      Given Trump’s dominance, however, there is no guarantee that a narrowing field will threaten the former president’s lead with time so short. An alternative lesson that the ex-president’s rivals might draw is that forceful condemnations of Trump’s 2020 election denialism are likely to be fatal to their campaigns. Indeed, candidates like Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley have usually only dared to criticize Trump obliquely over his constitutional vandalism and criminal exposure – including two indictments linked to his attempts to overturn the 2020 election. They have said it’s time to move on from the dramas of the past and avoided going into details over the ex-president’s assault on democracy.\\n   \\n      Johnson has yet to publicly address his leading role in attempts to discredit Biden’s 2020 election win, having only taken part in a couple of friendly Fox News interviews since becoming the most powerful elected Republican last week after weeks of chaos caused by the ouster of former Speaker Kevin McCarthy. When a reporter asked him about the issue during a news conference on Capitol Hill, she was booed by GOP lawmakers — one of whom told her to shut up.\\n   \\n      Johnson was not as vocal as Trump in claiming that the 2020 election was marred by outright fraud or was a plot by Democrats to deprive the ex-president of a second term. But the Louisiana Republican orchestrated a number of the legal and quasi-constitutional efforts to cast doubt on Biden’s win. For example, he organized support among GOP lawmakers for a legal brief that joined Texas and other red states that questioned the results in swing states won by Biden. And on January 6, 2021, he signed a statement explaining that he and 36 other House Republicans would vote to sustain objections to electors from key states Biden won because they felt the votes were unconstitutional because of accommodations officials made to voters during the pandemic. And even after the US Capitol insurrection that day, Johnson joined the majority of House Republicans in voting to reject Electoral College votes.\\n   \\n      While his actions then threatened the democratic fabric of the nation, they appear to have helped his political career.\\n   \\n      There was evidence last week that Johnson’s maneuvering after the 2020 election helped secure his rise to the speakership. The little-known lawmaker emerged as a compromise candidate amid deep fatigue and frustration in the GOP conference as gaping splits in the party were making it impossible to find a new speaker. But the previous candidate for speaker, Rep. Tom Emmer of Minnesota, was mistrusted by many Trump backers because he didn’t vote to block the certification of Biden’s victory. Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, for example, said that Emmer’s vote to certify the 2020 election “played a big role” in her vote against him. “I couldn’t support a speaker of the House that didn’t object,” Greene said. “The speaker of the House needs to reflect the views and the will of Republican voters,” Greene said, reflecting the imperative for leading party figures to indulge the beliefs of base voters even if they aren’t true and even if they come at a cost with the general electorate.\\n   \\n      Democrats are already trying to make Johnson’s record on election credibility into a liability as the 2024 campaign heats up with Republicans seeking to cling onto their House majority.\\n   \\n      The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, for instance, sent a fundraising email to supporters on Sunday arguing that House Republicans “made the architect of their anti-democratic schemes” the speaker of the House. “We must defeat their MAGA Majority and win back the House in 2024,” the email said.\\n  ',\n",

       "  'contents': ' \\n      Republican\\xa0Sen. Tommy\\xa0Tuberville, who has held up military promotions for nine months, slammed a proposal being floated to change the chamber’s rules to allow a vote on many of the nominations en masse and attacked the White House and Senate Democrats for not negotiating with him.\\n   \\n      “It’s typical of this place. This administration would rather burn the Senate down and that’s what would happen. … If you change the rules of the Senate then it lasts forever,”\\xa0Tuberville\\xa0told CNN’s Manu Raju. “So they would rather burn down the Senate than negotiate.”\\n   \\n      All Senate Democrats would have to join with nine Republicans for this latest plan to work. The bloc of nominees wouldn’t include some higher-level military promotions, which senators would still want to confirm one at a time. The proposal could go to the Senate Rules Committee as soon as this week, a\\xa0source told CNN Thursday.\\n   \\n      Tuberville has been holding up military promotions since February because of a Department of Defense policy that reimburses travel costs for military members requiring reproductive care outside of the state in which they are stationed. The department enacted the policy after the reversal of Roe v. Wade last year overturned the constitutional right to an abortion and left the issue to individual states.\\n   \\n      The Alabama Republican added: “If they go around and, without negotiating, change the rules of the Senate it just goes to show you they want it their way or the highway.”\\n   \\n      Tuberville, declining to provide specifics, said that members of the military tell him that his holds are not impacting readiness – something which the Pentagon and White House have repeatedly highlighted in their arguments urging the senator to lift his objections.\\n   \\n      “If I thought this was happening, I wouldn’t be doing this. And I’ve told you that all along. And the people that I trust tell me that it’s not,” he told CNN.\\n   \\n      Tuberville’s hold is affecting a number of senior military posts in the Middle East as the US deploys units to the area amid heightened tensions after a series of attacks on coalition bases and the crisis in Israel and Gaza.\\n   \\n      The commander of the US Navy’s 5th Fleet – which is responsible for US naval operations in the Middle East region including the Red Sea and Gulf of Oman – is still awaiting promotion to deputy commander of US Central Command, which oversees US forces and operations in the region.\\n   \\n      The deputy commanders of both the 5th Fleet and US Air Forces Central are also included in Tuberville’s hold, as well as Central Command’s deputy director of strategy, plans and policy.\\n   \\n      Last month, Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro told CNN the holds would have a “negative impact” on combat readiness. He was joined by the secretaries for the Army and Air Force in describing Tuberville’s actions as harmful to US interests.\\n   \\n      Tuberville also said that he has had little or no interaction with the White House about the possibility of finding a solution.\\n   \\n      “No conversation. Nobody wants to negotiate. You know this is not a negotiating crowd over in the White House,”\\xa0Tuberville\\xa0said.\\n   \\n      Tuberville\\xa0also noted that he had spoken with\\xa0Sen.\\xa0Kyrsten\\xa0Sinema, an Arizona Independent, for 30 minutes about the possible rule change and said he doesn’t think she would support it.\\n   \\n      Under the hold, the Senate can still confirm individual military promotions, which the body has done for a few high-profile appointments, but cannot approve hundreds of promotions at once as a time-saving measure.\\n   \\nCNN’s Jack Forrest, Lauren Fox, Morgan Rimmer, Natasha Bertrand and Haley Britzky contributed to this report.\\n',\n",

       " {'headline': '\\n      Top Democrats plead with party: Stop looking for a Biden alternative\\n    ',\n",
       "  'contents': ' \\n      President\\xa0Joe Biden is just as low in the White House’s internal polls as in any of the public ones. Whenever aides stress over the numbers in their weekly political meetings, Mike Donilon — for decades, Biden’s top political adviser — is the consistent voice of the president’s innermost circle, according to people who have heard him. Biden’s numbers, Donilon says, are pretty much where they were this far out from the 2022 midterms and all the doubts sounded the same; but the president’s team pursued its own careful approach to the campaigns and then saw Democrats exceed expectations.\\n   \\n      But while Biden advisers are dismissive of Rep. Dean Phillips’ primary challenge launched this week, they are also annoyed\\xa0about it. And that annoyance betrays the fact that some of them share the same uneasiness many Democrats feel about a president whose age is twice his approval rating.\\n   \\n      Still,\\xa0they remain\\xa0confident\\xa0that Biden is Democrats’ best option\\xa0in 2024.\\xa0They also repeat that the\\xa0presidential\\xa0election will be decided on razor thin margins – and that if Biden loses to\\xa0former President\\xa0Donald Trump,\\xa0the GOP primary’s current front-runner,\\xa0the country will never be the same. None are heading into\\xa0next year feeling overly buoyant.\\n   \\n      Now, leading Democrats tell CNN they have partly themselves to blame\\xa0for\\xa0Biden’s soft support — that months of\\xa0airing out “what if” alternatives to\\xa0him\\xa0and\\xa0Vice President\\xa0Kamala Harris only served to undercut candidates who were never actually close to being replaced.\\n   \\n      “In uncertain times — globally, on the economy — when you see the former president, with all of the crises, with a House that’s so dysfunctional, I think people naturally have a little bit of nervousness,” Democratic Gov. Tim Walz said in an interview two days before\\xa0Phillips, a fellow Minnesotan, launched his presidential campaign. “Democrats by nature are a little bit skittish. They get themselves worried. They work themselves up. They talk in their groups, amongst one another — just stop it.”\\n   \\n      A few minutes earlier, Walz had been onstage in Washington at a Center for American Progress event, chiding a crowd of engaged but worried Democrats, “Everybody who says, ‘I wish he was younger.’ I wish I was skinnier! [Florida Gov. Ron] DeSantis wishes he was more likable! It’s not going to happen. … There’s a responsibility for us not to buy into that.”\\n   \\n      Or as Pennsylvania Rep. Brendan Boyle told CNN more bluntly,\\xa0“People should shut the hell up.”\\n   \\n      “I deal in the real world,”\\xa0said\\xa0the Philadelphia-area Democrat, who has been proudly supporting\\xa0Biden\\xa0for years. “He is going to be the nominee, regardless of whether people think they can construct on paper a more attractive nominee or not.”\\n   \\n      Boyle and others slam what they say has been\\xa0a\\xa0dangerous feedback loop between Democratic leaders and political reporters daydreaming about a potentially dramatic election. Doubts have fed more doubts. News reports quoting politicians and voters and operatives questioning whether candidates other than\\xa0Biden\\xa0or Harris will emerge have led to more people asking those questions, dampening the president’s and vice president’s popularity and slowing grassroots fundraising. Columns suggesting that one of them should\\xa0step aside get nervously emailed around, begetting more columns.\\n   \\n      Even some of the people close enough to the administration to score invitations to the Rose Garden or to receptions around the pool at the vice president’s Naval Observatory residence keep chattering about whether support for Biden is like a political version of the emperor’s new clothes. No one powerful is willing to speak bluntly about his weaknesses, though they sometimes relay their fears to CNN while still at those events.\\n   \\n      “Every time Democrats go on TV and say, ‘The president’s done a great job, but he’s 80 years old,’ all they’re doing is feeding this appetite out there by some for a third-party run,” said Missouri Rep. Emanuel Cleaver,\\xa0a Kansas City-area Democrat. “And that could be the worst thing that happens in a century.”\\n   \\n      “Joe\\xa0Biden\\xa0is on the freedom, democracy and opportunity agenda that beat MAGA Republicans in 2020, in 2022, and will win again in 2024,” Ben Wikler, the Democratic party chair in the top battleground state of Wisconsin, told CNN. “Every hour that someone spends fantasizing about some other ticket is an hour they could have spent calling voters or raising money to help reelect President\\xa0Biden\\xa0and Vice President Harris.”\\n   \\n      Phillips was sincerely torn\\xa0in the weeks leading up to his announcement, weighing what people familiar with his thinking say was both a sincere belief that a Democrat needed to step up and\\xa0challenge Biden and concern that he could feed more doubts about the president.\\n   \\n      “If someone wanted to get their name ID out there, why would they do this and take the arrows and the mean-spiritedness and the aggression and the sacrifice that this requires?” he told reporters Friday morning in Concord, New Hampshire, ahead of filing his paperwork\\xa0for the\\xa0Granite\\xa0State’s primary.\\xa0(New Hampshire’s refusal to abide by national Democrats’ new calendar, under which the state no longer holds the first primary, means that voting there will be symbolic, with no delegates at stake. State party officials are planning to back a write-in campaign on Biden’s behalf after his campaign formally notified the secretary of state this week that he would not be participating.)\\n   \\n      A better-known candidate with clearer appeal entering the primary was always closer to\\xa0“The West Wing”\\xa0reboot fan fiction, though\\xa0Biden\\xa0advisers kept tabs on potential threats — and very deliberately co-opted those potential future ambitions by naming most\\xa0of them\\xa0to the campaign’s “advisory board” or\\xa0as\\xa0top surrogates.\\n   \\n      That is where those potential future candidates say they\\xa0are happy to be — at least for now.\\n   \\n      “The train is out of the station. It’s time for everyone to get on board. There is so much at stake in this upcoming election, from fundamental rights to our democracy itself,” Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, who is among those most discussed as a potential replacement for both\\xa0Biden\\xa0and Harris (and who was a runner-up for\\xa0Biden’s 2020 running mate pick), said while at a Democratic National Committee meeting in St. Louis earlier this month to try to pump people up for the ticket. “We’ve got to stop hand-wringing and stop playing out different scenarios. It’s a waste of energy.”\\n   \\n      Biden advisers say with a frustrated weariness that the core of\\xa0his argument, even at his primary campaign’s lowest point in 2019\\xa0– that he would be the best positioned candidate to beat Trump – has already been tested, and\\xa0Biden\\xa0came out with 7 million more votes and 74 more electoral votes. They point not just to what he has accomplished in office, but to his holding together a coalition of Democrats from progressives to centrists better than anyone expected him to.\\n   \\n      In a time of much partisan tribalism and information saturation, they say, no president is ever going to have poll numbers like in years past. They chalk up much of the focus on his age to Democrats who cannot conceive how Trump could be anywhere near competitive, as these Biden advisers try to rationalize polls that show the former president very much is. (They have given up trying to convince the chattering classes that moments such as Biden’s day trip to Israel demonstrate his continued vitality.) They dismiss the idea that some potential replacement\\xa0Democratic\\xa0candidate would all of a sudden open up a bigger lead over Trump or the other Republican prospects.\\n   \\n      And in internal meetings and phone calls with others working on Biden’s reelection, they reiterate\\xa0their insistence that\\xa0this\\xa0is all chatter that will fade once voters are faced with the choice, once again,\\xa0between\\xa0Biden and Trump.\\n   \\n      “People talk about competency,” Harris said in her own keynote appearance at the DNC meeting in St. Louis. “I think we should just every week do a split screen at this point.”\\n   \\n      Despite Phillips’ campaign billing his kick-off Friday as a “momentous event” in a mass text message sent to New Hampshire Democrats, few believe he has any chance of seriously registering in the race against Biden.\\n   \\n      Boyle told CNN this week that between the war in Israel and Gaza and the chaos of House Republicans electing their new speaker, he had not had “one conversation with anyone” about Phillips.\\n   \\n      Asked if he was worried about Phillips being a factor even back home in their state’s primary, Walz laughed.\\n   \\n      “No, no,” the governor said. “Not going to carry Minnesota.”\\n   \\n      A few weeks before Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein’s death,\\xa0a Los Angeles Times column floated a wild idea that California Gov. Gavin Newsom should fill\\xa0her seat by appointing Harris back to the Senate, a supposedly elegant solution that\\xa0would allow\\xa0Biden\\xa0could pick someone else to be his running mate. California politicos started getting calls from supporters of the vice president,\\xa0according to\\xa0people who were told about the effort. The idea was ridiculous and offensive, they said, and they urged people to say it out loud.\\n   \\n      They are not the only ones stepping up the offensive defense. Last month, after former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi seemed to stop short of full support for Harris being on the ticket and\\xa0Maryland Rep. Jamie Raskin also appeared to hesitate over backing her, the reelection campaign scrambled into action. Reminders were sent around about how\\xa0Biden\\xa0advisers wanted that question answered, urging Democratic politicians to stop appearing to leave wiggle room, according to people who saw\\xa0the messages come in.\\n   \\n      Within minutes of Raskin going off the air, House Democratic leadership staff was in touch with his office and others, urging them to remember that they needed to stop stirring up doubts, on or off the record. And West Wing aides and a network of informal advisers have meanwhile stepped up their social media attention to Harris, boosting good news about her that they say disproves a Washington narrative that she is unpopular.\\n   \\n      “All these pundits will talk about polling, polling, polling — OK, fine, let’s talk about that,” Harris said, drawing an enthusiastic standing ovation during the DNC meeting\\xa0in St. Louis.\\xa0“What we did on the climate crisis: I think 80% popularity. Lowering the cost of prescription drugs to $35 a month, I think everyone loves that. $2,000 a year for seniors for prescription medication, hallelujah. Fighting for relief of student loan debt. 800,000 new manufacturing jobs. Popular, popular, popular.”\\n   \\n      When\\xa0asked earlier this month if he thought it was time to stop questioning\\xa0Biden’s and Harris’s spots on the ticket, Raskin told CNN, “Yes, I do.”\\n   \\n      Asked if he was worried about the questions leeching support from\\xa0Biden, Raskin hesitated.\\n   \\n      “That which doesn’t kill him,” the congressman said hopefully, “makes him stronger.”\\n   \\nCORRECTION: This story has been updated to reflect that Missouri Rep.

       "  'contents': ' \\n      The US attorney who in 2020 vetted unverified claims from an FBI informant about alleged Ukrainian bribes paid to the Bidens recently testified to House lawmakers that he found some of the material credible enough to pass the tip along to the prosecutor leading the Hunter Biden criminal probe, according to a transcript reviewed by CNN.\\n   \\n      This is one of the first pieces of evidence obtained by House Republicans to give some credence to their assertions that the\\xa0still-unproven bribery claims\\xa0deserved scrutiny from federal prosecutors.\\n   \\n      However, the former US attorney, Scott Brady,\\xa0also said in his House interview that even though he corroborated some material from the informant, he did not determine whether the underlying Biden bribery claims were true. And he acknowledged that his team never reviewed some key evidence that undercut the bribery claims.\\n   \\n      Brady, a Donald Trump appointee, recently gave this account to House lawmakers who are looking into claims of pro-Biden political interference inside the Justice Department.\\n   \\n      His testimony sheds new light on how his office vetted the tip, and he disputed past Democratic claims that he “closed” the matter without recommending any further scrutiny. However, it doesn’t bolster the GOP narrative that Joe Biden or his son Hunter Biden were offered or accepted a bribe. They deny the allegations.\\n   \\n      Amid the Trump-Ukraine impeachment in early 2020, top Trump appointees at the Justice Department\\xa0assigned Brady\\xa0to vet information about the Bidens and Ukraine that was being sent in by the public. This included material from Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani, who played a leading role\\xa0peddling lies\\xa0about the Bidens’ dealings in Ukraine.\\n   \\n      The uncorroborated Biden bribery claims\\xa0originated in an “FD-1023,”\\xa0an FBI form that captures information provided by an informant, also known as a “CHS,” which stands for confidential human source. The informant described his interactions with Mykola Zlochevsky, a Ukrainian oligarch and owner of the energy company Burisma, where Hunter Biden had served on the board. The informant said Zlochevsky spoke of $10 million in bribes that he paid to the Bidens.\\n   \\n      “We were able to corroborate certain information that was represented by the CHS and is memorialized in this 1023,” Brady told House lawmakers. “Some of the underlying allegations relating to Hunter Biden and President Biden by Mr. Zlochevsky, we were not in a position to investigate further or determine whether they were true or false.”\\n   \\n      Brady said that “the 1023 had indicia of credibility sufficient to merit further investigation,” so his team handed it off to David Weiss, the US attorney in Delaware, who is leading the Hunter Biden probe. Weiss’\\xa0long-running criminal investigation\\xa0has intensely scrutinized Hunter Biden’s finances and foreign business deals, including in Ukraine.\\n   \\n      The transcript reviewed by CNN indicates that some of Brady’s corroboration pertained to the informant’s travel records, and whether he met with Zlochevsky when he claimed he did. Brady also said he reviewed public information, conferred with the informant’s handler, and asked the FBI to re-interview the informant, which they eventually did.\\n   \\n      However, Brady acknowledged that he did not review some exculpatory material regarding the supposed bribe.\\n   \\n      He said his team never saw an interview that Zlochevsky gave to Giuliani ally Lev Parnas, where he undercut what he supposedly told the FBI informant about bribes. Brady also said he didn’t review a public denial from then-Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko that Joe Biden tried to pressure him to end a Burisma investigation.\\n   \\n      “Had we been aware of this, we would’ve definitely shared that with Delaware when we shared the 1023 with them and allowed them to reconcile the two, do further investigation or not, based on their discretion and knowledge,” Brady told lawmakers.\\n   \\n      CNN has reached out to the White House for comment about Brady’s interview.\\n   \\n      Congressional Republicans obtained the FBI document and publicly released it in July, over strong public objections from the bureau, which said there were “significant concerns” that the disclosure “unnecessarily risks the safety of a confidential source.”\\n   \\n      The FBI document says an informant described a 2016 meeting where Zlochevsky allegedly said, “It costs 5 (million) to pay one Biden, and 5 (million) to another Biden.”\\n   \\n      The informant, whom the FBI has described as highly credible, was “not able to provide any further opinion as to the veracity” of the claims, according to the FBI document. The\\xa0FBI\\xa0document also said the informant\\xa0told investigators\\xa0that it was common for oligarchs like Zlochevsky to “brag or show-off” with lofty claims about payments and political influence.\\n   \\n      There is no evidence Joe Biden was involved in Hunter Biden’s work for Burisma or that he ever received payments tied to his son’s foreign dealings in Ukraine or elsewhere.\\n   \\n      The new testimony from Brady also disputes past statements from some House Democrats that sought to pour cold water on the bribery allegations.\\n   \\n      Maryland Rep. Jamie Raskin, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee,\\xa0claimed in June\\xa0that Brady “terminated the investigation.” Raskin claimed Brady “said there were no grounds for further investigative steps, so they ended that,” though the Democrat added, “In terms of another investigation, you know, I can’t speak to that.”\\n   \\n      This came up during Brady’s interview, though he was never presented with Raskin’s full statement. Brady was asked about how “Raskin has claimed that you shut down the investigation” into the 1023 form, and Brady respond, “That’s not true.” The former Pittsburgh-based prosecutor said he closed his assessment after passing it to Weiss.\\n   \\n      Back in June, Raskin\\xa0also said,\\xa0“Mr. Brady’s team found insufficient evidence to warrant escalating this assessment to a preliminary or full investigation, and it was closed.”\\n   \\n      Asked about this, Brady testified that it was essentially a half-truth: He said he did an “administrative closing” of his assessment, not because “we deemed it not credible,” but because he was passing it along to Weiss, who already had a full investigation underway in Delaware.\\n   \\n      “This would never be a grand jury investigation out of the Western District of Pennsylvania. Everyone knew that,” Brady said.\\n   \\n      In the wake of the Brady interview, Rep. James Comer, the GOP chair of the House Oversight Committee, asked Raskin to “apologize” and “correct the record” for “lying to the American people” about how Brady handled the bribery tip.\\n   \\n      In a new letter to Comer on Monday shared with CNN, Raskin said Comer’s request was “hopeless,” “baffling” and “desperate.”\\n   \\n      “Given that I am one of a small handful of people in America still following this convoluted and tiresome wild goose chase, you have apparently decided that you must now go after me too,” Raskin wrote to Comer.\\n   \\n      The saga of a once-trusted FBI informant bringing explosive but unverified claims about a presidential candidate is reminiscent of the\\xa0Christopher Steele debacle\\xa0in 2016.\\n   \\n      Many liberals embraced Steele’s claims of Trump-Russia collusion, while Trump\\xa0assailed\\xa0the “unverified” dossier. This time, the political roles are reversed: Republicans are championing the unproven bribery claims, as Democrats try to discredit the material.\\n   \\n      Brady said in his interview that he’s “not certain” if there are “conclusive determinations” by the US government about “allegations of Russian interference” in the 2016 election. This flies in the face of the consistent findings that the Kremlin tried to help Trump win.\\n   \\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.\\n',\n",

       "  'contents': ' \\nEditor’s note: Dr. Katie Hurley, author of “No More Mean Girls: The Secret to Raising Strong, Confident and Compassionate Girls,” is the senior clinical adviser of The Jed Foundation. She specializes in work with tweens, teens and young adults.\\n \\n      A high school senior recounted the past few weeks to me, trying to find the point where everything went wrong.\\n   \\n      She read through old text messages and dissected all her social media posts as well as those from her old friend group. If she could just find a way to convince them to take her back, she thought, she might save her senior year from ruin.\\n   \\n      The friend group breakup was swift and played out both at a party and on social media.\\n   \\n      Her crime? Showing up late to a birthday party because she went out with friends from a previous school first without telling anyone. She double-booked and got caught on Instagram Stories. Members of the group told her to leave the party, humiliated her and blocked her number. Then they got on Snapchat, Instagram and TikTok. In short, she was canceled.\\n   \\n      Relational aggression among teens isn’t anything new, but it can be especially hideous when it plays out alongside cyberbullying. In some cases, it’s nearly impossible to distinguish between the two subtypes of bullying.\\n   \\n      Relational aggression includes attempts to damage the reputation of another person or existing relationships and can involve gossip, rumors, manipulation, social isolation, public humiliation, threats of harm, hateful commentary and even hateful written content.\\n   \\n      One in five students report bullying, with a higher percentage of male-identifying students reporting physical bullying (6% versus 4%) and a higher percentage of female-identifying students reporting being the subject of rumors (18% versus 9%) and being purposely excluded from social events (7% versus 4%), according to statistics compiled by PACER’s National Bullying Prevention Center. More than 70% of LGBTQ students reported verbal bullying, including being called names and threatened.\\n   \\n      While cyberbullying occurs within the context of some form of a digital device, many of the behaviors are similar. Cyberbullying can consist of name-calling, hate speech (including religious based and racial bullying), threats of harm, rumors, constantly being asked for location and details, receiving unwanted images (called cyberflashing) and sharing of explicit images without consent (revenge porn). There is a lot of crossover, and the data on cyberbullying shows that teens are struggling.\\n   \\n      Some 46% of 13- to 17-year-olds report experiencing at least one cyberbullying incident, with 32% reporting offensive name-calling and 22% reporting having rumors spread about them online, according to a survey by the Pew Research Center. These incidents can occur on social media but also via text, email, online document services and video game chats.\\n   \\n      Cancel culture trickled down to teens, tweens and even younger children, and the combination of cyberbullying and social isolation in school can be swift. In other cases, manipulation plays a role in ongoing relational aggression. Sometimes teens are lured back into their former groups only to endure humiliation, rumors and isolation all over again. No matter how it plays out, relational aggression harms people.\\n   \\n      It’s also important to note that students sometimes switch roles. The aggressor one week might become a victim another week as a different person gains power within the group. Teens often tell me that one small misstep, such as a comment that one person doesn’t like, can be the error that causes the group to turn. Trying to manage friendships becomes stressful and includes hypervigilance in an effort to avoid making social errors.\\n   \\n      The reasons for being bullied reported most often include physical appearance, race/ethnicity, gender, disability, religion and sexuality, according to PACER. While female-identifying students report double the rate of rumors than male-identifying students and just under twice the rate of social exclusion, these issues affect students regardless of gender identity.\\n   \\n      Teens are using maladaptive strategies, such as spreading rumors and targeting certain peers, to manage conflict and cope with negative social interactions. When we solely focus on female-identifying students by chalking it up to “Mean Girls” stuff and calling it a rite of passage, we ignore the fact that all students are growing up in this challenging landscape of multiple social worlds.\\n   \\n      School closures and restrictions on social gatherings to reduce the spread of Covid-19 significantly reduced teens’ opportunities to socialize and to endure and work through the usual growing pains of adolescence together. They connected in tiny online video squares and social media posts during that time, which limited how they experienced friendship.\\n   \\n      While the disruptions affected the day-to-day lives of teens in a myriad of ways, it also may have had a negative impact on brain development. Teen brains appeared to age about three years during a 10-month period, according to the results of a small October study, supported by the National Institute of Mental Health, that included MRI scans of adolescents between the ages of 13 and 17.\\n   \\n      The areas of the brain affected by this premature aging included the hippocampus, amygdala and cortex, responsible for memory, emotion regulation, and self-control and problem-solving, respectively.\\n   \\n      It’s reasonable to expect that teens are struggling to cope with their emotions, handle conflict in an effective manner and work through problems at this time. It’s up to the adults around them to know that and help them scaffold these skills.\\n   \\n      Teens need sources of support and understanding when they’re dealing with relational aggression and cyberbullying, and this is where protective factors become important.\\n   \\n      Factors that contribute to positive mental health outcomes include having at least one close friend, family support, one anchor in the school environment (teacher, coach, counselor), staff awareness of and willingness to take bullying seriously, problem-solving and coping skills, and opportunities to socialize outside of the source of relational aggression.\\n   \\n      If all this information has your head spinning, slow down and take a beat. It’s difficult to bear witness to teens enduring emotional pain for any reason, including all forms of bullying.\\n   \\n      Here are steps that parents and guardians can take to support teens:\\n   \\n      • Believe them the first time. Resist the urge to question every story and choose to be present with them.• Validate their experiences and emotions.• Empathize with your teen. You don’t need to solve every problem, but you do need to communicate empathy and understanding.• Ask open-ended questions to give your teen time to process what’s happening.• Brainstorm action steps together. Filing incident reports can feel overwhelming and scary, so take time to discuss different options.• Resist the urge to share information in social media groups or by text. Right now, you need to focus on your teen.• Research the reporting options at your teen’s school in case your teen decides to seek help on campus.• Talk about resources such as therapy, group support or other sources of social support.\\n   \\n      All forms of bullying are hurtful and can negatively affect the mental health of the victim. What’s difficult about relational aggression is that it’s often subtle and under the radar of adults working in teen spaces.\\n   \\n      One thing we can all do is talk more openly about these behaviors and lean into empathy development as a healthy component of raising teens who care about the emotional well-being of other teens.\\n   \\nGet inspired by a weekly roundup on living well, made simple.\\xa0Sign up for CNN’s Life, But Better newsletter for information and tools designed to improve your well-being.\\n',\n",

       "  'contents': ' \\nSign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter.\\xa0Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\\n \\n      Scientists have detected a surprising amount of a rare version of helium, called helium-3, in volcanic rocks on Canada’s Baffin Island, lending support to the theory that the noble gas is leaking from Earth’s core — and has been for millennia.\\n   \\n      The research team also detected helium-4 within the rocks.\\n   \\n      While helium-4 is common on Earth, helium-3 is more readily found elsewhere in the cosmos, which is why scientists were surprised to detect a larger amount of the element than had been previously reported from the rocks on Baffin Island. A study describing the discovery published recently in the journal Nature.\\n   \\n      “At the most basic level, there is little 3He (helium-3) in the universe compared to 4He (helium-4),” said lead study author Forrest Horton, associate scientist in the department of geology and geophysics at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, in an email.\\n   \\n      “3He is rare in Earth because it has not been produced in or added to the planet in significant quantities and it is lost to space,” Horton added. “As Earth’s rocky portion stirs and convects like hot water on a stove top, material ascends, cools, and sinks.During the cooling stage, helium is lost to the atmosphere and then to space.”\\n   \\n      Detecting elements that leak from Earth’s core can help scientists unlock insights into how our planet formed and evolved over time, and the new findings provide evidence to bolster an existing hypothesis about how our planet came to be.\\n   \\n      Baffin Island, located in the territory of Nunavut, is the largest island in Canada. It’s also the fifth-largest island in the world.\\n   \\n      A high ratio of helium-3 to helium-4 was first detected in Baffin Island volcanic rocks by Solveigh Lass-Evans as part of her doctoral studies under the supervision of University of Edinburgh scientist Finlay Stuart. Their findings were published in Nature in 2003.\\n   \\n      The composition of a planet is a reflection of the elements that formed it, and previous research found that trace amounts of helium-3 leaking from Earth’s core supports the popular theory that our planet originated in a solar nebula — a cloud of gas and dust that likely collapsed due to the shock wave of a nearby supernova — which contained the element.\\n   \\n      Horton and his colleagues took it a step further when they conducted research on Baffin Island in 2018, studying the lava that erupted millions of years ago when Greenland and North America split apart, making way for a new seafloor. They wanted to investigate the rocks that may contain insights about the contents locked within Earth’s core and mantle, the mostly solid layer of Earth’s interior located beneath its surface.\\n   \\n      The researchers traveled by helicopter to reach the remote, otherworldly landscape of the island, where lava flows have formed towering cliffs, giant icebergs float by and polar bears stalk the coastline. Local organizations, including the Qikiqtani Inuit Association and Nunavut Research Institute, provided the researchers with access, advice and protection from the bears, Horton said.\\n   \\n      “This area on Baffin Island holds special importance both as sacred lands for the local communities and as a scientific window into the deep Earth,” he said.\\n   \\n      The Arctic rocks that Horton and his team investigated revealed surprisingly higher measurements of helium-3 and helium-4 than was reported by previous research, and the measurements varied among the samples they collected.\\n   \\n      “Many of the lavas are full of bright green olivine (also known as the gemstone peridot), so breaking off fresh pieces with a rock hammer was as thrilling as breaking apart geodes as a kid: each rock was a treasure to be discovered,” Horton said. “And what scientific treasures they turned out to be!”\\n   \\n      Only about one helium-3 atom exists for every million helium-4 atoms, Horton said. The team measured about 10 million helium-3 atoms per gram of olivine crystals.\\n   \\n      “Our high 3He/4He measurements imply that gases, presumably inherited from the solar nebula during solar system formation, are better preserved in Earth than previously thought,” he said.\\n   \\n      But how did the helium-3 end up in the rocks in the first place?\\n   \\n      The answer may begin as far back as the big bang, which, when it created the universe, also released an abundance of hydrogen and helium. These elements were incorporated into the formation of galaxies over time.\\n   \\n      Scientists believe our solar system formed 4.5 billion years ago within a solar nebula. As the dust cloud collapsed from\\xa0a\\xa0nearby\\xa0supernova\\xa0event, the resulting material formed a spinning disk that eventually gave rise to our sun and the planets, according to NASA.\\n   \\n      Helium inherited from the solar nebula likely became locked in Earth’s core as the planet formed, making the core a reservoir of noble gases. As helium-3 leaked from the core, it ascended to the surface through the mantle in the form of magma plumes that eventually erupted on Baffin Island.\\n   \\n      “During the eruption, the vast majority of the gases in the magma escaped to the atmosphere,” Horton said. “Only the olivine crystals that grew prior to eruption trapped and preserved the helium from the deep Earth.”\\n   \\n      The new research supports the idea that helium-3 is leaking from Earth’s core and has been for some time, but the researchers aren’t entirely sure when this process began.\\n   \\n      “The lavas are about 60 million years old, and the ascent of the mantle plume took perhaps tens of millions of years,” Horton said. “So, the helium we measured in these rocks would have escaped the core perhaps 100 million years ago or possibly much earlier.”\\n   \\n      Helium leaking from Earth’s core doesn’t affect our planet or have any negative implications, he said. The noble gas does not chemically react with matter, so it won’t have an impact on humanity or the environment.\\n   \\n      Next, the research team wants to investigate whether the core is a storehouse of other light elements, which could account for the why Earth’s outer core is less dense than expected.\\n   \\n      “Is the core a major repository of elements like carbon and hydrogen, which are so important in terms of planetary habitability? If so, have fluxes of these elements from the core over (Earth’s) history influenced planetary evolution? I am excited to investigate links between helium and other light elements,” Horton said. “Perhaps helium can be used to track other elements across the core-mantle boundary.”\\n   \\nClarification: This story has been updated to reflect the solar system formed from a collapsed dust cloud that had resulted from a nearby supernova event.\\n',\n",

For those in the northern United States, heading into autumn usually means raking leaves, packing up summer clothes, and pulling coats and other warmer clothes out of storage.\\n   \\n      Regardless of climate, many people decorate their homes and landscapes for fall and the upcoming holidays, so lugging boxed decorations out of storage and spending time decorating are on many folks’ seasonal agendas.\\n   \\n      What a lot of people don’t realize is that those seasonal chores are functional exercises that can burn more calories than some traditional fitness activities. In fact, raking leaves can burn more calories in an hour than a brisk walk or weight training session.\\n   \\n      What’s more, because seasonal chores, like raking, are considered moderate-intensity cardiovascular exercise, time spent preparing for the fall season counts toward the recommended 150 minutes of moderate exercise per week.\\n   \\n      According to the physical activity calorie calculator on the American Council on Exercise’s website, a person with a body weight of 170 pounds (77 kilograms) would burn 308 calories doing an hour of yard work, such as raking. Comparatively, walking briskly at a pace of 3.5 miles per hour burns only 293 calories for that same 170-pound person. For those focused on indoor seasonal chores, using the same body-weight metric, an hour of housework at 231 calories is the equivalent of an hour of basic weight training.\\n   \\n      The calculator gives you an idea of potential caloric burn, but keep in mind that these numbers are only estimations since your individual metabolism in any exercise session is influenced by many factors, including age, biological sex, body composition, fitness level and intensity of effort. Using a wearable fitness tracker that includes this personal information in its calculation will give a more accurate, individualized number.\\n   \\n      When you go to the gym to work out, you carefully consider the weights you use and the time you spend exercising. You also gauge the overall demands on your body versus your fitness level and what you believe you are actually capable of doing. For instance, if you have only ever used 10-pound dumbbells for overhead pressing, you would know better than to switch suddenly to 50 pounds because you would likely hurt yourself.\\n   \\n      Unfortunately, too many people forget to use that mindset when doing seasonal chores. Some look at the task at hand as simply needing to be done and just do it — or attempt to — without considering their own potential limitations, prepping their bodies for the demands of the task, and keeping in mind proper form and other factors while executing the chore. This lack of awareness can easily lead to injury.\\n   \\n      To maximize your fitness benefits and lower your risk of injury, follow the tips below:\\n   \\n      With any form of exercise, it’s important to prepare for the associated movements and effort. Take a few moments to move your body in all directions and planes of motion while raising your heart rate. Begin with some gentle stretching and progress to movements such as arm circles, walking lunges, lateral lunges, jumping jacks, jogging in place and other similar warm-up exercises.\\n   \\n      Just as you would execute an exercise at the gym, you want to perform your seasonal chores with the same attention to proper form. Lifting should be done by bending your knees and using your legs as your main source of power. Stay aware of your balance and maintain stability with a hip-distance or a slightly wider, even stance during most tasks. Whenever you’re twisting, as you would when raking or shoveling, focus on rotating from the middle of your back — never your lower back — to avoid strains.\\n   \\n      Because most humans have a dominant side, we tend to favor that side while doing chores. But doing an hour of sided work, especially seasonal work that you don’t commonly do, could lead to significant muscle soreness and overuse injury. That’s why it’s best to switch sides every few minutes. It may feel awkward and slow you down a bit to use your nondominant side, but hurting later will feel much worse and slow you down even more.\\n   \\n      Be realistic about the tasks you are trying to accomplish. As with the earlier example of not using weights that you know you couldn’t lift, don’t risk injury by trying to do the impossible. Get someone to help with any heavy lifting beyond your capability, break up larger tasks into smaller ones and take breaks as needed.\\n   \\n      Remember that an adult body is composed of up to 60% water. Even in cooler temperatures outside, we lose fluid through our sweat. That’s why it’s critical to take water breaks during your chores and keep hydrated after you’re done with your work.\\n   \\n      Because your seasonal work may be less familiar to your body, there is a good chance you will feel sore afterward, having worked muscles in different ways than your normal routine. To lessen the chance of significant soreness, take a few minutes to stretch and breathe after you complete your chores. And then give your body some much-needed recovery by taking time to rest and put your feet up, eat a healthy, satiating meal and get enough sleep.\\n   \\n      By following the guidelines above, you can safely maximize the benefits of fall seasonal tasks, getting your house, yard and body in shape for the upcoming holidays.\\n  ',\n",

       " {'headline': '\\n      Spy satellite photos reveal hundreds of long-lost Roman forts, challenging decades-old theory\\n    ',\n",
       "  'contents': ' \\nSign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter.\\xa0Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\\n \\n      Declassified photos captured by United States spy satellites launched during the Cold War have revealed an archaeological treasure trove: hundreds of previously unknown Roman-era forts, in what is now Iraq and Syria.\\n   \\n      Many of those long-lost structures may be gone forever at this point, destroyed or damaged over recent decades due to agricultural expansion, urban development and war. Nevertheless, the discovery of the forts’ existence challenges a popular hypothesis established in the 1930s about the role of such fortifications along the ancient Roman Empire’s eastern border, researchers reported Wednesday in the journal Antiquity.\\n   \\n      Based on the satellite views, the high number of forts and their widespread distribution hints that the forts may not have been erected to keep enemies out, as the decades-old theory suggested. Rather, the structures were likely built to ensure safe passage for caravans and travelers along routes that saw plenty of nonmilitary traffic. These forts, according to the study authors, were outposts and havens, not hostile barriers.\\n   \\n      High-resolution images analyzed in the new study were taken during flyovers by multiple satellites belonging to two US military programs: the Corona Project (1960 to 1972) and Hexagon (1971 to 1986). Corona’s images were declassified in 1995, and Hexagon’s photos were released to the public in 2011.\\n   \\n      Images from Hexagon and Corona are invaluable for archaeologists because they preserve snapshots of landscapes that have since undergone significant disruption, said lead study author Jesse Casana, an archaeologist and professor in the department of anthropology at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire.\\n   \\n      “Agriculture and urbanization have destroyed a lot of archaeological sites and features to a shocking degree,” Casana told CNN. “This old imagery allows us to see things that are often either obscured or no longer extant today.”\\n   \\n      Satellite images are especially helpful for searches across the northern part of the Fertile Crescent in the Middle East — from the eastern coast of the Mediterranean to western Iran\\xa0— because of the area’s archaeological importance and high visibility of the ground in photos, Casana added.\\n   \\n      The research team pored over the images for signs of Roman forts, which have a distinctive square shape and walls that usually measure about 164 to 262 feet (50 to 80 meters) long. The scientists began their search using reference maps from an aerial survey of the region conducted in the 1920s and 1930s by French archaeologist and Jesuit missionary Father Antoine Poidebard. That survey was among the first to photograph archaeological sites from the air, and in 1934 Poidebard reported finding 116 Roman forts.\\n   \\n      It was an unprecedented achievement. But nearly a century later, mapping Poidebard’s forts to satellite photos was challenging. Because his map wasn’t large-scale, it contained numerous spatial errors, Casana said. Poidebard also did not provide names or numbers for most of the forts he found, identifying them instead by their proximity to geologic features.\\n   \\n      Those forts were aligned north to south along what was once the easternmost boundary of the Roman Empire, according to Poidebard. This arrangement, he claimed, was surely intended to guard against invaders from the east.\\n   \\n      But Poidebard’s survey provided only a partial view of Rome’s ancient infrastructure, the researchers found. What he overlooked — and what the satellite photos revealed — was that the north-to-south line of 116 forts was actually only a narrow sliver of a cluster spreading from east to west and containing 396 fortified structures.\\n   \\n      The forts spanned approximately 116,000 square miles (300,000 square kilometers), “extending from Mosul, on the Tigris River in Iraq, through Ninawa province, across the Khabur and the Balikh valleys, continuing to the semi-arid plains west of the Euphrates River, leading to western Syria and the Mediterranean,” according to the study.\\n   \\n      When the archaeologists performed a second survey of an image subset, they found 106 more fortlike structures, hinting that further investigations will yield many more Roman forts. Based on excavations of other Roman sites in the region, the scientists estimated that the forts were built between the second and sixth centuries.\\n   \\n      While Poidebard’s row of forts along the Roman Empire’s eastern front looked like a military fortification, this new evidence suggested that the forts collectively served a different purpose. Rather than presenting an impassable wall on a violent frontier, they provided oases of safety and order along well-traveled Roman roads.\\n   \\n      Borders in this world “were places of dynamic cultural exchange and movement of goods and ideas,” not barriers, Casana said. And perhaps that perspective holds a lesson for the modern era, he added.\\n   \\n      “Historically, as an archaeologist, I can say that there have been many attempts by ancient states to build walls across borders and it has been a universal failure,” Casana said. “If there’s any way that archaeology contributes to modern discourse, I would hope it is that building giant walls to keep people out is a bad plan.”\\n   \\nMindy Weisberger is a science writer and media producer whose work has appeared in Live Science, Scientific American and How It Works magazine.\\n',\n",

       " {'headline': '\\n      Snapchat isn’t just for teens anymore. Now it needs to make some real money\\n    ',\n",
       "  'contents': ' \\n      When Snapchat announced last month that it had reached 5 million paying subscribers for its Snapchat+ service, it seemed like a stunning achievement. The milestone marked the halfway point to the 10 million subscriber number that CEO Evan Spiegel had just months earlier identified as a “medium-term” goal.  \\n   \\n      The service’s success in just 15 months after launching proved that despite Snapchat’s reputation as an app used mainly by teens, users are willing to cough up money for a premium experience on the platform. At 5 million subscribers paying $3.99 per month, Snapchat+ is set to earn around $239 million in annual revenue. \\n   \\n      That subscriber number is just a fraction of its overall user base of Snapchat, which has quietly become one of the world’s fastest-growing social platforms. As of the end of June, it reported 397 million daily active users — more than X, the platform formerly known as Twitter. The company’s challenge now is figuring out how to successfully monetize those users to turn around a streak of disappointing financial results. When Snap reports earnings next week for the quarter ended in September, it’s expected to post its third consecutive revenue decline. \\n   \\n      Despite having invented some of the most important social media features over the past decade — stories and filters — Snapchat is often thought of as an app mainly for young people with less reach and cultuiral relevance than rivals like TikTok, Instagram and Facebook. But Snapchat’s user growth suggests that the app remains among the most dominant platforms, even as (and perhaps because) it’s charting a different course from most competitors. As other platforms increasingly lean into discoverability and showing users entertaining content from people they don’t know, Snap remains focused on its longtime strategy of connecting users with their real-life social circle. \\n   \\n      “At the end of the day, you have a better time connecting with the people you care about most, and we want to make sure that those connections are enduring and that we can provide experiences to enhance them,” Jack Brody, Snapchat’s vice president of product, told CNN. “By focusing on that, we feel like we’re solving problems that real users face every single day, and creating real, differentiated value.” \\n   \\n      Still, revenue growth hasn’t kept pace with those user gains. In the first six months of this year, Snap’s sales dipped more than 5% compared to the year-ago period, and it posted an operating loss of $769 million. Snap’s (SNAP) shares are down more than 11% since this time last year. \\n   \\n      The sales declines come as Snapchat, like other platforms, works to update its advertising business to cope with changes to Apple’s app tracking policies. And it comes as the company funnels money into innovations in artificial intelligence and augmented reality.  \\n   \\n      Snap has also faced lawsuits from parents alleging the app contributed to their children’s mental health struggles or enabled them to buy illicit drugs, with sometimes fatal outcomes. (Snapchat says it has a range of safety features to protect young users, including restrictions on friend suggestions and requests from strangers, default privacy settings and parental oversight options.)\\n   \\n      Still, analysts say Snap’s user growth continues to represent a major opportunity for the company.  \\n   \\n      “In my view, there’s significant value for a company that’s growing its installed base at this level,” said Angelo Zino, senior equity analyst at CFRA Research. “At the end of the day, when you think about advertisers, they want to go where the eyes are.” \\n   \\n      Snapchat gained popularity following its 2011 launch for the ability to send disappearing photos to friends, with the option to add silly filters. Two years later, Snapchat launched Stories, where users could share a series of photos and videos to all of their friends that would be viewable for only 24 hours, creating demand for more spontaneous, ephemeral types of content across social media.  \\n   \\n      Since then, Snapchat has continued to expand, adding features like a “Discover” section with public content and the Snap Map, where users can see their friends’ locations and public posts from popular locations. The company has also invested in more ambitious, experimental projects like a selfie drone, which it discontinued following mass layoffs last year, and AR glasses, investment in which has also been scaled back. \\n   \\n      But its core mission is to allow users to have more private conversations with their friends. And that’s fueled an ongoing boom in its user numbers. Snapchat has grown its user base by more than 10% year-over-year for the past 16 consecutive quarters. \\n   \\n      “That interpersonal and small group focus is really important and appealing especially to younger social media users who don’t want to broadcast their entire lives to mass audiences,” the way they would on TikTok or Instagram, said Jess Maddox, an assistant professor at the University of Alabama who researches social media platforms and internet popular culture. \\n   \\n      Snapchat says that much of its daily user base is distinct from other platforms, according to a study of 10,000 users conducted on Snap’s behalf by market research firm GWI during the first half of 2023. The group found that 43% of the people aged 16-64 who used Snapchat did not use TikTok, and more than half of daily Snapchatters in the same age range were not using YouTube on a daily basis. \\n   \\n      “Snapchat was really kind of created as an antidote to traditional social media,” Brody said. “This was a platform for connecting with your closest friends, not everybody you’ve ever met … and because of that, people come to Snapchat for a very different reason than why they go to other platforms.” \\n   \\n      Market research firm Insider Intelligence estimated in a June report that Snapchat would overtake TikTok as the fastest growing platform worldwide as of the end of 2023. Already, parent company Snap said at its February investor day that it has 150 million monthly active users in North America — a figure that mirrors the number of users that TikTok says it has in the United States (although TikTok did not specify how often those users are interacting with the app). \\n   \\n      A major portion of that growth is coming from outside of the United States. Snapchat has, for example, made a big push into India, following the country’s TikTok ban in 2020. Users from outside of North America and Europe now make up more than half of Snapchat’s daily active user base and grew at a rate of 25% year-over-year in the second quarter of 2023, compared to 14% overall daily active user growth.  \\n   \\n      Snapchat’s task now: making a meaningful profit from all of those users.  \\n   \\n      “The biggest reason [for its financial challenges] is that when you think about Snap, they are largely a messaging platform, and it is extremely difficult … to monetize messaging platforms,” CFRA’s Zino said. Other major tech companies that operate messaging platforms, including Meta and Apple, don’t count on those services to generate significant revenue, if any.  \\n   \\n      What’s more, advertisers are increasingly looking to invest in so-called “direct response” advertising where users are immediately prompted to buy a product — advertising that is much more easily done on a platform like Instagram where users are already often discussing specific products and it’s easy to link to an advertiser’s website or push users to buy directly on the platform’s e-commerce section. Snapchat, by contrast, has traditionally leaned more heavily into brand awareness, said Scott Kessler, global technology sector lead at research firm Third Bridge, although the company now also gets the majority of its revenue from direct response ads.  \\n   \\n      “While there still is brand advertising online for sure, I think that there are a lot of challenges and a lot of conversations about what this looks like going forward,” Kessler said. “Snap is in a uniquely challenged position because of its historical focus on brand advertising.”  \\n   \\n      Snapchat has also placed a greater emphasis on user privacy than many of its peers — a boon to users but a challenge for advertising, Kessler noted.  \\n   \\n      Engagement time on Snapchat may also play a role — the app has the lowest user time spent compared to social media peers, likely owing to its focus on messaging rather than endless scrolling through content, according to market intelligence firm SensorTower. The average Snapchat user in the third quarter of 2023 spent just 19 minutes per day on the app, compared to 103 minutes per day on TikTok, 60 minutes per day on Instagram and 28 minutes per day on X, SensorTower data shows.  \\n   \\n      But Snapchat says its users are checking in on the app regularly — 40 times a day on average in the United States, according to Brody.  \\n   \\n      Spiegel said during Snap’s July earnings call that following its restructuring last year, which cut 20% of its staff, the company is investing heavily to improve its direct response advertising business. He added that the company’s active advertisers were up 20% year-over-year. \\n   \\n      And Brody says those investments should enable the platform to better capitalize on its user base.   \\n   \\n      “At the end of the day, digital advertising is built on reach and engagement, and we have been growing both steadily,” he said. “It’s been a transition year for us in terms of really rebuilding a lot of the foundational pieces of our ad platform and we’re seeing some really promising signs there. And these ad platforms improvements will allow us to truly capitalize on this opportunity … in the future.” \\n  ',\n",

       " {'headline': '\\n      New York AG accuses crypto firms of deceiving investors in $1 billion fraud\\n    ',\n",
       "  'contents': ' \\n      The fallout from the colossal implosion of Sam Bankman-Fried’s crypto business is still rippling through the digital asset industry nearly a year later.\\n   \\n      On Thursday, New York’s attorney general filed a lawsuit against three digital asset firms that were caught up in the collapse of Bankman-Fried’s empire last fall — Gemini Trust, Genesis Global Capital and Digital Currency Group, parent company of Genesis. The lawsuit accused the companies of lying to investors and covering up more than $1 billion in losses. \\n   \\n      The AG’s office said that an investigation found Gemini, the crypto firm founded by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, deceived investors about significant risks associated with a lending service it ran jointly with Genesis. The program, called Gemini Earn, marketed itself as a low-risk investment in which customers could lend crypto assets to Genesis while earning interest payments as high as 8%.  \\n   \\n      “These cryptocurrency companies lied to investors,” Attorney General Letitia James said in a statement. “And it was middle-class investors who suffered as a result.” At least 29,000 New Yorkers were among the 230,000 investors whose money was lost, James said. \\n   \\n      James’ lawsuit is the latest effort among US officials to crack down on the trillion-dollar crypto industry, which for years has operated in the shadows of traditional financial regulation. Crypto advocates argue that regulators have dragged their feet in establishing guidelines for digital assets, which they believe are distinct from traditional securities like stocks or bonds. \\n   \\n      In the immediate aftermath of the FTX crash, Genesis froze customer redemptions in its lending unit, citing market turmoil. The lending unit later filed for bankruptcy. \\n   \\n      According to the latest lawsuit, Gemini knew that Genesis’ loans were risky and, at one point, “highly concentrated” with Bankman-Fried’s crypto trading house Alameda Research. Bankman-Fried is currently on trial in federal court in New York, where he has pleaded not guilty to seven counts of fraud and conspiracy. \\n   \\n      “Gemini hid the risks of investing with Genesis, and Genesis lied to the public about its losses,” James said.\\n   \\n      The lawsuit also names former Genesis CEO Soichiro “Michael” Moro and Digital Currency Group CEO Barry Silbert.\\n   \\n      Gemini’s owners, the Winklevoss twins, have said Genesis owed more than $900 million to some 340,000 customers using the Earn program.\\n   \\n      The AG’s lawsuit follows another civil action brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which in January sued Genesis and Gemini for offering unregistered securities through the Earn product. \\n   \\n      Gemini responded to the latest suit Thursday with a statement on X (formerly Twitter), claiming that Gemini itself was the victim of a “massive fraud.”\\n   \\n      “The NY AG’s lawsuit confirms what we’ve been saying all along” — that Gemini, its customers and other creditors were lied to about Genesis’ finances. But the company said it “wholly” disagrees with the lawsuit. \\n   \\n      “Blaming a victim for being defrauded and lied to makes no sense and we look forward to defending ourselves against this inconsistent position.”\\n   \\n      A Genesis spokesperson said that “while there is no basis for the NYAG’s claims against Genesis, we have been cooperating with all authorities and intend to continue doing so.”\\n   \\n      “Genesis has not violated the law and continues to focus on maximizing recoveries for creditors in its Chapter 11 cases,” the spokesperson added.\\n  ',\n",

It also supports the hover feature, which allows users to preview and switch between different tools and app controls, when used with a 12.9-inch iPad Pro 12.9-inch (6th generation) and 11-inch iPad Pro (4th generation). The price is $79, down $20 from the second-generation Apple Pencil and $50 less than the original. \\n   \\n      The biggest change to the latest model comes to the charging system, which is noteworthy not only because the company has been resistant to making the switch for years but because it’s about to make charging that much easier for its customers.\\n   \\n      At its iPhone 15 event in September, the company announced all of its next-generation smartphones and new AirPods Pro will launch with USB-C charging. Apple previously switched its iPads and MacBooks to USB-C charging, but the push to finally add it to iPhones came less than a year after the European Union voted to approve legislation to require smartphones, tablets, digital cameras, portable speakers and other small devices to support USB-C charging by 2024. \\n   \\n      The first-of-its-kind law aims to pare down the number of chargers and cables consumers must contend with when they purchase a new device and to allow users to mix and match devices and chargers even if they were produced by different manufacturers. In doing so, however, Apple will give up control of its wired charging ecosystem, and identifying good chargers from bad ones won’t be obvious to many consumers.\\n   \\n      Although Apple does not break out its Pencil sales numbers, David McQueen, a director at ABI Research, estimates about 42 million have been sold since it launched in 2015, considering 420 million iPads have been sold since then (assuming 10% or fewer of these consumers have bought an Apple Pencil).\\n   \\n      “I’d have to think it’d be this low because of its relatively high price, high-end use case, and the availability of much cheaper alternatives that are capable of working with iPad,” he said.\\n  ',\n",

In its Thursday announcement, the body gave both Meta and TikTok until October 25 to respond to its requests and warned that it had the power to impose financial penalties if it was not satisfied with their responses. \\n   \\n      Both companies also have until November 8 to detail how they intend to protect the “integrity of elections” on their platforms, the commission said. \\n   \\n      Both Meta and TikTok are bound by obligations set out in the DSA, a landmark piece of legislation, enacted in August, that seeks to more stringently regulate large tech companies, and protect people’s rights online. \\n   \\n      The commission’s formal requests come a week after it issued a similar ultimatum to X, the company formerly known as Twitter, asking for information on how it intends to stop the spread of illegal, misleading, violent and hateful content. \\n   \\n      The commission said it had opened an investigation into X’s compliance with the DSA.

       "  'contents': ' \\nEditor’s Note: Sign up for CNN’s Meanwhile in China newsletter which explores what you need to know about the country’s rise and how it impacts the world.\\n \\n      The Biden administration is reducing the types of semiconductors that American companies will be able to sell to China, citing the desire to close loopholes in existing regulations announced last year.\\n   \\n      On Tuesday, the US Commerce Department unveiled new rules that further tighten a sweeping set of export controls first introduced in October 2022.\\n   \\n      The updated rules “will increase effectiveness of our controls and further shut off pathways to evade our restrictions,” US Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said in a statement. “We will keep working to protect our national security by restricting access to critical technologies, vigilantly enforcing our rules, while minimizing any unintended impact on trade flows.”\\n   \\n      Advanced artificial intelligence chips, such as Nvidia’s H800 and A800 products, will be affected, according to a regulatory filing from the US company. \\n   \\n      The regulations also expand export curbs beyond mainland China and Macao to 21 other countries with which the United States maintains an arms embargo, including Iran and Russia.\\n   \\n      The measures, which have affected the shares of major American chipmakers, are set to take effect in 30 days.\\n   \\n      The original rules had sought to hamper China’s ability to procure advanced computing chips and manufacture advanced weapons systems. Since then, senior administration officials have suggested they needed to be adjusted due to technological developments.\\n   \\n      Raimondo, who visited China in August, said the administration was “laser-focused” on slowing the advancement of China’s military. She emphasized that Washington had opted not to go further in restricting chips for other applications.\\n   \\n      Chips used in phones, video games and electric vehicles were purposefully carved out from the new rules, according to senior administration officials.\\n   \\n      But these assurances are unlikely to placate Beijing, which has vowed to “win the battle” in core technologies in order to bolster the country’s position as a tech superpower.\\n   \\n      China’s Foreign Ministry criticized the Biden administration’s new rules Monday, before they were officially unveiled. \\n   \\n      “The US needs to stop politicizing and weaponizing trade and tech issues and stop destabilizing global industrial and supply chains,” spokesperson Mao Ning told a press briefing. “We will closely follow the developments and firmly safeguard our rights and interests.”\\n   \\n      As part of ongoing dialogue established by Raimondo and other US officials with their Chinese counterparts, Beijing was informed of the impending updates, according to a senior administration official.\\n   \\n      “We let the Chinese know for clarity that these rules were coming, but there was no negotiation with them,” the official told reporters. \\n   \\n      The tech rivalry between the world’s two largest economies has been heating up. In recent months, the United States has enlisted its allies in Europe and Asia in restricting sales of advanced chipmaking equipment to China.\\n   \\n      In July, Beijing hit back by imposing its own curbs on exports of germanium and gallium, two elements essential for making semiconductors.\\n   \\n      Shares of US chipmakers fell Tuesday following the announcement of new export controls.\\n   \\n      Nvidia’s (NVDA) stock closed down 4.7%, while Intel (INTC) slipped 1.4%. AMD (AMD) shares ended 1.2% lower.\\n   \\n      In its filing, Nvidia said the rules imposed new licensing requirements for exports to China and other markets such as Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Vietnam.\\n   \\n      The company said its A800 chip, which was reportedly created for Chinese customers in order to circumvent last year’s restrictions, would be among the components affected. \\n   \\n      However, “given the strength of demand for our products worldwide, we do not anticipate that the additional restrictions will have a near-term meaningful impact on our financial results,” Nvidia said.\\n   \\n      The broader US chipmaking industry is also examining the impact of the new rules.\\n   \\n      The Semiconductor Industry Association said in a statement Tuesday that while it recognized the need to protect national security, “overly broad, unilateral controls risk harming the US semiconductor ecosystem without advancing national security as they encourage overseas customers to look elsewhere.” \\n   \\n      “We urge the administration to strengthen coordination with allies to ensure a level playing field for all companies,” added the group, which represents 99% of the US chip sector.\\n   \\n      The measures are also being reviewed in Europe. On Tuesday, ASML, the Dutch chipmaking equipment manufacturer, said it was evaluating the implications of the rules, though it did not expect them “to have a material impact on our financial outlook for 2023.”\\n   \\n      During a call Wednesday about the company’s third-quarter results, ASML chief executive Peter Wennink said the updated export restrictions would affect between 10% and 15% of the firm’s sales to China. \\n   \\n      On Tuesday, the US Department of Commerce added 13 Chinese entities to a list of firms with which US companies may not do business for national security reasons.\\n   \\n      They include two Chinese startups, Biren Technology and Moore Thread Intelligent Technology, and their subsidiaries. \\n   \\n      The department alleges that these companies are “involved in the development of advanced computing chips that have been found to be engaged in activities contrary to US national security.” \\n   \\n      CNN has reached out to Biren and Moore Thread for comment.\\n   \\n— Anna Cooban contributed reporting.\\n',\n",

       "  'contents': ' \\n      Nokia will slash up to 14,000 jobs in a major cost-cutting drive to address a “weaker” market environment, it said in a statement on Thursday. \\n   \\n      The Finnish telecom giant, a major provider of 5G equipment that employs 86,000 people, announced the move as part of a wider restructuring that will lower its headcount to between 72,000 and 77,000.\\n   \\n      The move will help the company reduce staffing expenses by 10% to 15%, and save at least €400 million ($421.4 million) in 2024 alone, the company projected.\\n   \\n      Overall, it said the reductions are expected to trim Nokia’s costs by up to €1.2 billion (nearly $1.3 billion) cumulatively by the end of 2026. Nokia (NOK) said it would “act quickly” to make changes.\\n   \\n      “The most difficult business decisions to make are the ones that impact our people,” CEO Pekka Lundmark said in the statement. “We have immensely talented employees at Nokia and we will support everyone that is affected by this process.”\\n   \\n      The announcement came on the same day that Nokia reported worse-than-expected results.

       "  'contents': ' \\n      Demand for Apple’s new iPhone 15 lineup is weaker in China than for last year’s models, according to analysts. \\n   \\n      Sales for the iPhone 15 are down 4.5% in China compared to iPhone 14 sales in the first two weeks after its launch, according to Counterpoint Research. Separately, Bloomberg reported on Monday financial firm Jefferies said iPhone 15 sales dropped by a double-digit percentage following strong customer demand for Huawei’s new Mate 60 smartphone line.\\n   \\n      Apple\\n            \\n                (AAPL) shares fell 0.08% following the reports.\\n   \\n      The reports come amid a floundering Chinese economy, a struggling housing market, and more competition among higher-end vendors in China, particularly from Chinese device manufacturer Huawei.\\n   \\n      “We’re seeing a lot of nationalism right now as Chinese consumers who think they’ve been wronged by the US government and sanctions are gravitating toward the Mate 60 and that is edging into Apple volumes,” Jeff Fieldhack, research director at Counterpoint, told CNN.\\n   \\n      At the same time, China remains very important to Apple as it is the largest market behind the US. Fieldhack said he doesn’t believe Huawei will surpass Apple right now in terms of smartphone sales but expects continued interest in the Mate 60 will continue to “eek” into Apple’s numbers. \\n   \\n      “Apple made a lot of gains during its launch period last year, where it became number one in China,” he said. “Things looked strong but now, with the political tension and competition, that is a reason for concern.”\\n   \\n      However, the Phone 15 lineup is up about 10% year-over-year in the US, according to Counterpoint. That’s strong growth for Apple considering sales fell for the third consecutive quarter in August, ahead of the iPhone 15 launch. \\n   \\n      The latest iPhone 15 devices come with a slimmer design, a more-advanced main camera system and a customizable Action button, which gives the silence button additional controls, from starting a voice memo to writing a note. Perhaps the biggest change coming to the models is that they will now use a USB-C charging cord, ending an 11-year run with Apple’s proprietary Lightning charging cable.\\n   \\n      This isn’t the first time the Mate 60 has made headlines since its late August launch. In September, the US government sought more information about the Mate 60 Pro’s 5G Kirin 9000s processor reportedly developed specifically for the manufacturer. Its debut shocked industry experts who questioned how the company could make such a chip following sweeping efforts by the United States to restrict China’s access to foreign chip technology because of perceived national security concerns.\\n  ',\n",

       " {'headline': '\\n      The story behind Michael Jordan’s ultra-private, ultra-exclusive personal golf course\\n    ',\n",
       "  'contents': ' \\n      There’s one small corner of the world that Michael Jordan cherishes more than any other — his own personal haven of sporting bliss.\\n   \\n      But it’s not in Chicago. In fact, there isn’t a basketball court or hoop in sight.\\n   \\n      Even as he was staking his claim in the 1990s as the greatest player the NBA has ever seen, the Bulls icon was a regular guest on the golf course. These days, though, he hosts.\\n   \\n      The Grove XXIII – a nod to his signature No. 23 jersey — is Jordan’s very own golf paradise, a private club tucked away on the outskirts of Hobe Sound, Florida. Ultra-exclusive, few have seen it, and even fewer have played it.\\n   \\n      For Bobby Weed, it was at once the most straightforward and most difficult brief he had ever received: “Build me the best golf course. Build me the best driving range.”\\n   \\n      And there had been plenty of briefs before. A protégé, then close friend, of legendary course designer Pete Dye, the South Carolinian served as the PGA Tour’s chief architect before launching his own course design company in 1994.\\n   \\n      Almost three decades on, Bobby Weed Golf Design has sculpted more than 20 courses from the ground up – from Stillwater, Minnesota, to Mito, Japan — and renovated many more, including Hobe Sound’s Medalist Golf Club in 2015.\\n   \\n      With Tiger Woods headlining a member’s list that reads like a who’s who of the game’s elite, the Medalist is a private club that attracts a star-studded cohort of visitors. Among them was Jordan, a keen admirer of the revamp and who, in late 2017, was on the hunt for a course architect.\\n   \\n      A meeting later, Weed’s team was signed on to construct a golf kingdom fit for “His Airness.” As one of history’s most famous athletes, and with a net worth edging towards the $2 billion mark, according to Forbes, Jordan was a special category of client.\\n   \\n      “I knew that it would get a lot of attention because of MJ,” Weed, 68, told CNN.\\n   \\n      “I knew that there was some fanfare associated with it and I didn’t want to let him down.”\\n   \\n      The land was secured soon after, some 200-plus acres of former citrus grove, next to Atlantic Ridge State Park. As he often does for projects, Weed lived on site, making the 265-mile switch across the state from Ponte Vedra Beach.\\n   \\n      Weed was all-in, and encouraged Jordan to be as engaged as he wanted to be in developments, inviting him to come out once weekly to track the progress. Jordan often visited multiple times a week.\\n   \\n      Weed likens his role as course architect to that of a quarterback: calling plays for a large roster of consultants. Watching Jordan in discussion with the team during one early meeting, he got the impression of a coach interacting with his players.\\n   \\n      “I think one of his qualities is he was such a good listener, and he absorbed everything that you were discussing,” Weed said.\\n   \\n      “He didn’t come out and say ‘do this or do that.’ He came out and observed and was a great listener, and he let me do my job.”\\n   \\n      Weed had his two pillars for a great golf course — an engaged owner and a good piece of property, though the latter would require some polishing.\\n   \\n      Turning a flat, “featureless” site – bordered by two long drainage canals – into a cross between the manicured, parkland style of Augusta National and the rustic layout of Pine Valley represented the greatest challenge to him and his team.\\n   \\n      Dirt was excavated from lagoons to build the course and its features, fixing the flatness issue and leaving behind six large lakes – the same number of NBA Championships Jordan won. It was a coincidence, but ultimately fit the theme of a course tuned to the finest degree to its owner’s style.\\n   \\n      Jordan wanted firm and fast, a course that could both excite and challenge its members, many of whom would be among the PGA Tour’s current stars. A double-helix layout, with a “crossover” at the 5th and 14th holes, offers the flexibility to play continual internal circuits in three, six, or nine-hole loops – ideal for Jordan’s busy schedule.\\n   \\n      The course didn’t just need to suit the playstyle of its owner, though, it needed to enhance it.\\n   \\n      “You don’t think I’m going to spend this much money and not have a little bit of an advantage do you?” Weed recalled Jordan saying.\\n   \\n      Add to that the five-time MVP’s penchant for wagers, which will be familiar to viewers of docuseries “The Last Dance,” and the course has earned a new name among some members: “Slaughterhouse 23.”\\n   \\n      “It’s his golf course, so it’s set up very well for him,” former world No. 1 Rickie Fowler told the Subpar podcast in 2020.\\n   \\n      Weed, too, got drawn into the wagers, even during construction.\\n   \\n      “I can remember us being out there hitting shots and doing a little gambling while we were just playing in the dirt.

       " {'headline': '\\n      The story behind Michael Jordan’s ultra-private, ultra-exclusive personal golf course\\n    ',\n",
       "  'contents': ' \\n      There’s one small corner of the world that Michael Jordan cherishes more than any other — his own personal haven of sporting bliss.\\n   \\n      But it’s not in Chicago. In fact, there isn’t a basketball court or hoop in sight.\\n   \\n      Even as he was staking his claim in the 1990s as the greatest player the NBA has ever seen, the Bulls icon was a regular guest on the golf course. These days, though, he hosts.\\n   \\n      The Grove XXIII – a nod to his signature No. 23 jersey — is Jordan’s very own golf paradise, a private club tucked away on the outskirts of Hobe Sound, Florida. Ultra-exclusive, few have seen it, and even fewer have played it.\\n   \\n      For Bobby Weed, it was at once the most straightforward and most difficult brief he had ever received: “Build me the best golf course. Build me the best driving range.”\\n   \\n      And there had been plenty of briefs before. A protégé, then close friend, of legendary course designer Pete Dye, the South Carolinian served as the PGA Tour’s chief architect before launching his own course design company in 1994.\\n   \\n      Almost three decades on, Bobby Weed Golf Design has sculpted more than 20 courses from the ground up – from Stillwater, Minnesota, to Mito, Japan — and renovated many more, including Hobe Sound’s Medalist Golf Club in 2015.\\n   \\n      With Tiger Woods headlining a member’s list that reads like a who’s who of the game’s elite, the Medalist is a private club that attracts a star-studded cohort of visitors. Among them was Jordan, a keen admirer of the revamp and who, in late 2017, was on the hunt for a course architect.\\n   \\n      A meeting later, Weed’s team was signed on to construct a golf kingdom fit for “His Airness.” As one of history’s most famous athletes, and with a net worth edging towards the $2 billion mark, according to Forbes, Jordan was a special category of client.\\n   \\n      “I knew that it would get a lot of attention because of MJ,” Weed, 68, told CNN.\\n   \\n      “I knew that there was some fanfare associated with it and I didn’t want to let him down.”\\n   \\n      The land was secured soon after, some 200-plus acres of former citrus grove, next to Atlantic Ridge State Park. As he often does for projects, Weed lived on site, making the 265-mile switch across the state from Ponte Vedra Beach.\\n   \\n      Weed was all-in, and encouraged Jordan to be as engaged as he wanted to be in developments, inviting him to come out once weekly to track the progress. Jordan often visited multiple times a week.\\n   \\n      Weed likens his role as course architect to that of a quarterback: calling plays for a large roster of consultants. Watching Jordan in discussion with the team during one early meeting, he got the impression of a coach interacting with his players.\\n   \\n      “I think one of his qualities is he was such a good listener, and he absorbed everything that you were discussing,” Weed said.\\n   \\n      “He didn’t come out and say ‘do this or do that.’ He came out and observed and was a great listener, and he let me do my job.”\\n   \\n      Weed had his two pillars for a great golf course — an engaged owner and a good piece of property, though the latter would require some polishing.\\n   \\n      Turning a flat, “featureless” site – bordered by two long drainage canals – into a cross between the manicured, parkland style of Augusta National and the rustic layout of Pine Valley represented the greatest challenge to him and his team.\\n   \\n      Dirt was excavated from lagoons to build the course and its features, fixing the flatness issue and leaving behind six large lakes – the same number of NBA Championships Jordan won. It was a coincidence, but ultimately fit the theme of a course tuned to the finest degree to its owner’s style.\\n   \\n      Jordan wanted firm and fast, a course that could both excite and challenge its members, many of whom would be among the PGA Tour’s current stars. A double-helix layout, with a “crossover” at the 5th and 14th holes, offers the flexibility to play continual internal circuits in three, six, or nine-hole loops – ideal for Jordan’s busy schedule.\\n   \\n      The course didn’t just need to suit the playstyle of its owner, though, it needed to enhance it.\\n   \\n      “You don’t think I’m going to spend this much money and not have a little bit of an advantage do you?” Weed recalled Jordan saying.\\n   \\n      Add to that the five-time MVP’s penchant for wagers, which will be familiar to viewers of docuseries “The Last Dance,” and the course has earned a new name among some members: “Slaughterhouse 23.”\\n   \\n      “It’s his golf course, so it’s set up very well for him,” former world No. 1 Rickie Fowler told the Subpar podcast in 2020.\\n   \\n      Weed, too, got drawn into the wagers, even during construction.\\n   \\n      “I can remember us being out there hitting shots and doing a little gambling while we were just playing in the dirt. It was just great fun and interaction,” he said.\\n   \\n      “It’s hard not to go out there and play a round with MJ without having a friendly wager.”\\n   \\n      To meet the second requirement of Jordan’s brief, Weed’s team set aside 20 acres to construct a state-of-the-art practice facility that the designer believes has no equal.\\n   \\n      Two 400-yard, double-sided driving lanes can be maintained for specific conditions, such as US Open or PGA Tour style fairways, with “target greens” in 25-yard increments. Each green has built-in pods that can track swathes of shot information, incorporating the PGA Tour’s ShotLink data.\\n   \\n      The putting green is split into four quadrants, with incremental slopes ranging from 0-1% to 3-4% inclines. Even the grass on the tees is customizable, with different types to mimic warm or cool seasons.\\n   \\n      “It’s a Tour player’s haven to work on their game,” said Weed.\\n   \\n      Compared to Bobby Weed Golf Design, Nichols Architects had considerably less experience in golf courses, but it did have one key advantage in its efforts to beat other bids to build The Grove XXIII’s clubhouse.\\n   \\n      Specializing in hospitality, residential, and commercial design, the firm had worked on the W South Beach in Miami — the favorite hotel of Jordan’s wife Yvette Prieto.\\n   \\n      The team pulled no punches with its pitch to Jordan. “You’re not going to confuse this clubhouse with a clubhouse down the road or anything like that, and that’s what we’re selling you,” planning and design partner Igor Reyes told CNN of the pitching process, likening it to that depicted in the “Air” movie, where Nike must lure a rookie Jordan away from a deal with Adidas.\\n   \\n      “You’ve really got to make an architectural iconic shape, and a shape that you could almost immediately feel was swinging across the landscape.

       " {'headline': '\\n      Six bull sharks inadvertently made their home on an Australian golf course. Then they vanished\\n    ',\n",
       "  'contents': ' \\n      For golfers, staying out of the water could be the difference between winning and losing. At one course in Australia, it was the difference between life and death.\\n   \\n      Because Carbrook in Queensland boasted a membership unlike any other golf club on the planet: six resident bull sharks.\\n   \\n      From their mysterious arrival to their devastating disappearance 17 years later, this is the tale of the sport’s most hazardous water hazard.\\n   \\n      A lake on a landlocked golf course some 14 kilometers (8.7 miles) from the Pacific Ocean may sound like a swim too far for any fish, but the bull shark has a reputation for dipping its fins into a range of habitats.\\n   \\n      River shark, freshwater whaler, estuary whaler, swan river whaler – the clue is in its other names. While native to warm and tropical waters worldwide, bull sharks have organs specially adapted to retain salt, allowing them to venture deep into freshwater environments that would prove fatal to other sharks due to a loss of sodium.\\n   \\n      Hence the presence of the stocky-built, blunt-nosed sharks in the Logan River – which slices inland from the sea halfway between Brisbane and Gold Coast before meandering around Carbrook golf club – came as no real surprise to locals in the 1990s.\\n   \\n      Neither did severe flooding.\\n   \\n      Twinned with the region’s subtropical climate, the club has been a hotspot for floods since its inception in 1978, inundated with water on numerous occasions including in 1991, 1995 and 1996.\\n   \\n      The downpours were so torrential that on the latter three occasions, the roughly 100-meter land bridge separating the river from the sand-mine-turned-lake beside the course’s 14th hole was totally submerged. A new corridor was opened and – sometime during those three temporary windows – six bull sharks glided into uncharted waters.\\n   \\n      As the land bridge dried and reformed, the door slammed shut behind them. It would remain closed for 17 years, when the next severe flood event reforged a path to the river in 2013.\\n   \\n      Towards the end of the century, whispers began to trickle around Carbrook’s fairways – all originating from the 14th green.\\n   \\n      There were reports of loud splashes, large dark shapes moving below the lake’s surface, even laughed-off claims of a tall dorsal fin knifing through the water. “The Carbrook Shark” became a kind of folk legend, Australia’s own Bigfoot, Yeti or – most similarly of all – a local version of another famous lake-dwelling mythical beast.\\n   \\n      “The Loch Ness monster is pretty similar to what it felt like,” Carbrook general manager Scott Wagstaff told CNN.\\n   \\n      “It seemed possible but there wasn’t enough truth to it at that point.”\\n   \\n      That was until the early 2000s, when the Brisbane-based Courier Mail turned folklore into fact by publishing a picture of one of the sharks, Wagstaff recalled. Yet despite having played at the club for years, he had never seen them with his own eyes when he started work there in 2010.\\n   \\n      Determined to satisfy his curiosity, Wagstaff ventured down to the lake armed with his camera and some meat. No sooner had the bait hit the surface, a shark duly appeared.\\n   \\n      The stunned Wagstaff snapped some shots before taking a short video on his phone to post online. The footage was – by his own admission – “terrible,” but the internet lapped it up: the viral YouTube video has amassed more than 2.3 million views to date.\\n   \\n      Media interest boomed, and the club embraced its toothy tenants with vigor.\\n   \\n      A bull shark was added to the club’s logo, its youth program was named the Junior Shark Academy, and feedings were held at tournaments and corporate events – including one special wedding in 2009 where all six sharks appeared at once, Wagstaff recalls.\\n   \\n      Despite his affection for the sharks, Wagstaff was reluctant to call them pets, though he did nickname one “Patch,” thanks to its distinct back marking.\\n   \\n      Compared to the crocodiles and snakes dotting other courses in the country, Carbrook’s sharks made for extremely low-maintenance residents. Only two risk-management steps were taken: warning signage around the lake, and the rejection of any business from prospective golf ball divers, who retrieve balls from course lakes to sell them on.\\n   \\n      “It’s just not worth the few grand a year we get for a contract to put someone’s life at risk,” Wagstaff said.\\n   \\n      Fascination spread far beyond Australian borders, piquing the interest of one shark-loving scientist and researcher based at Ruhr University Bochum in Germany.\\n   \\n      Dr. Peter Gausmann published his study on the Carbrook sharks, titled “Who’s the biggest fish in the pond?” in the Marine and Fishery Sciences journal in August 2023. Their extended residence, he argued, sheds new light on just how adaptable bull sharks are.\\n   \\n      Even without the staff feeding the sharks, hunger was not a cause for concern in a lake 700 meters long, 380 meters wide and 15 meters deep, teeming with fish, from mullets to tarpons and snappers.\\n   \\n      Gausmann calculated that the sharks would need to consume half a ton of fish per year – or 0.44% of their body weight per day – to meet their energy needs. Having been juveniles when they arrived, sightings verified they had grown to a healthy range of between 1.8 and 3 meters by 2013.\\n   \\n      Only twice before had bull sharks been recorded surviving for years in isolated bodies of water, according to Gausmann, yet none had ever lasted so long.\\n   \\n      One group made it at least four years in Panama’s freshwater Lake Bayano in the 1980s, while another survived a decade of high salinity in South Africa’s Lake St. Lucia after becoming trapped in 2002.\\n   \\n      A stay of at least 17 years in low-salinity waters — more than half a bull shark’s lifespan — was unprecedented.\\n   \\n      “This out of the ordinary occurrence has shown verifiably for the first time how long bull sharks are able to survive in these low-salinity environments,” Gausmann told CNN.\\n   \\n      “The study has shown that bull sharks presumably have no limits to their residential time in freshwater environments such as lakes and rivers, and they are presumably – at least theoretically – able to spend their entire lifetime in these habitats.”\\n   \\n      Sadly for Gausmann and Carbrook, the true extent of their survivability remains unknown.\\n   \\n      It’s been eight years since a shark was last spotted in the lake. Their vanishing is a mystery, even to Gausmann.\\n   \\n      Sightings dropped in frequency after the 2013 floods, leading to fears that some sharks may have returned to the river or died as a result of the storm. Just two sharks were confirmed dead; one found floating on the surface, another killed by illegal fishing.\\n   \\n      Wagstaff, who had never noticed any sign of ill health among the sharks in more than 100 sightings, saw them only fleetingly after the fishing death. Gausmann believes it was unlikely the remaining sharks died in a “natural way” due to sodium loss or by any other “anatomical” failure, given their adaptability, and therefore theorizes that further illegal fishing is the “most likely” explanation for their disappearance.\\n   \\n      Whatever the reason, it’s an absence felt keenly by the club.\\n   \\n      “You can’t help yourself – you walk along the lake and you’re looking in, waiting to maybe catch a glimpse of a fin breaking the water,” Wagstaff said.\\n   \\n      “The members loved the fact that their golf course was their unique place in the world where we had sharks; they just embraced it.\\n   \\n      “We’d love to see them again.”\\n   \\n      Last year, the course was submerged by the biggest flood ever recorded in the area, Wagstaff said. Though devastating financially, closing the club for two months, it sparked hope that new sharks may have crossed from the river to repopulate the lake.\\n   \\n      Only time will tell, but Carbrook is already planning for a future without its mascot. Plans are in place to fill in the lake and build a new course there over the next decade, with all marine life – potential sharks included – subsequently relocated into waters elsewhere.\\n   \\n      Whether Wagstaff ever spots another fin in the lake or not, he will remember “Patch” and co. fondly as the guests who helped him overcome his fears. Once afraid of the ocean due to sharks, Wagstaff recently went scuba diving in the reefs of the Sunshine Coast to get up close and personal with some large grey nurse sharks.\\n   \\n      “There’s this kind of legend about sharks being aggressive because they’re coming into contact with humans, especially bull sharks because of the places they tend to swim – canals, creeks and rivers,” Wagstaff said.\\n   \\n      “But then to experience them in such close proximity and see how beautiful they are and how graceful they are – now I just find them fascinating, especially the bull shark.\\n   \\n      “They’re capable, so adaptive, and they are seriously beautiful when you’re a few feet away. It’s an incredible shark.”\\n  ',\n",

The footage was – by his own admission – “terrible,” but the internet lapped it up: the viral YouTube video has amassed more than 2.3 million views to date.\\n   \\n      Media interest boomed, and the club embraced its toothy tenants with vigor.\\n   \\n      A bull shark was added to the club’s logo, its youth program was named the Junior Shark Academy, and feedings were held at tournaments and corporate events – including one special wedding in 2009 where all six sharks appeared at once, Wagstaff recalls.\\n   \\n      Despite his affection for the sharks, Wagstaff was reluctant to call them pets, though he did nickname one “Patch,” thanks to its distinct back marking.\\n   \\n      Compared to the crocodiles and snakes dotting other courses in the country, Carbrook’s sharks made for extremely low-maintenance residents. Only two risk-management steps were taken: warning signage around the lake, and the rejection of any business from prospective golf ball divers, who retrieve balls from course lakes to sell them on.\\n   \\n      “It’s just not worth the few grand a year we get for a contract to put someone’s life at risk,” Wagstaff said.\\n   \\n      Fascination spread far beyond Australian borders, piquing the interest of one shark-loving scientist and researcher based at Ruhr University Bochum in Germany.\\n   \\n      Dr. Peter Gausmann published his study on the Carbrook sharks, titled “Who’s the biggest fish in the pond?” in the Marine and Fishery Sciences journal in August 2023. Their extended residence, he argued, sheds new light on just how adaptable bull sharks are.\\n   \\n      Even without the staff feeding the sharks, hunger was not a cause for concern in a lake 700 meters long, 380 meters wide and 15 meters deep, teeming with fish, from mullets to tarpons and snappers.\\n   \\n      Gausmann calculated that the sharks would need to consume half a ton of fish per year – or 0.44% of their body weight per day – to meet their energy needs. Having been juveniles when they arrived, sightings verified they had grown to a healthy range of between 1.8 and 3 meters by 2013.\\n   \\n      Only twice before had bull sharks been recorded surviving for years in isolated bodies of water, according to Gausmann, yet none had ever lasted so long.\\n   \\n      One group made it at least four years in Panama’s freshwater Lake Bayano in the 1980s, while another survived a decade of high salinity in South Africa’s Lake St. Lucia after becoming trapped in 2002.\\n   \\n      A stay of at least 17 years in low-salinity waters — more than half a bull shark’s lifespan — was unprecedented.\\n   \\n      “This out of the ordinary occurrence has shown verifiably for the first time how long bull sharks are able to survive in these low-salinity environments,” Gausmann told CNN.\\n   \\n      “The study has shown that bull sharks presumably have no limits to their residential time in freshwater environments such as lakes and rivers, and they are presumably – at least theoretically – able to spend their entire lifetime in these habitats.”\\n   \\n      Sadly for Gausmann and Carbrook, the true extent of their survivability remains unknown.\\n   \\n      It’s been eight years since a shark was last spotted in the lake. Their vanishing is a mystery, even to Gausmann.\\n   \\n      Sightings dropped in frequency after the 2013 floods, leading to fears that some sharks may have returned to the river or died as a result of the storm. Just two sharks were confirmed dead; one found floating on the surface, another killed by illegal fishing.\\n   \\n      Wagstaff, who had never noticed any sign of ill health among the sharks in more than 100 sightings, saw them only fleetingly after the fishing death. Gausmann believes it was unlikely the remaining sharks died in a “natural way” due to sodium loss or by any other “anatomical” failure, given their adaptability, and therefore theorizes that further illegal fishing is the “most likely” explanation for their disappearance.\\n   \\n      Whatever the reason, it’s an absence felt keenly by the club.\\n   \\n      “You can’t help yourself – you walk along the lake and you’re looking in, waiting to maybe catch a glimpse of a fin breaking the water,” Wagstaff said.\\n   \\n      “The members loved the fact that their golf course was their unique place in the world where we had sharks; they just embraced it.\\n   \\n      “We’d love to see them again.”\\n   \\n      Last year, the course was submerged by the biggest flood ever recorded in the area, Wagstaff said. Though devastating financially, closing the club for two months, it sparked hope that new sharks may have crossed from the river to repopulate the lake.\\n   \\n      Only time will tell, but Carbrook is already planning for a future without its mascot. Plans are in place to fill in the lake and build a new course there over the next decade, with all marine life – potential sharks included – subsequently relocated into waters elsewhere.\\n   \\n      Whether Wagstaff ever spots another fin in the lake or not, he will remember “Patch” and co. fondly as the guests who helped him overcome his fears. Once afraid of the ocean due to sharks, Wagstaff recently went scuba diving in the reefs of the Sunshine Coast to get up close and personal with some large grey nurse sharks.\\n   \\n      “There’s this kind of legend about sharks being aggressive because they’re coming into contact with humans, especially bull sharks because of the places they tend to swim – canals, creeks and rivers,” Wagstaff said.\\n   \\n      “But then to experience them in such close proximity and see how beautiful they are and how graceful they are – now I just find them fascinating, especially the bull shark.\\n   \\n      “They’re capable, so adaptive, and they are seriously beautiful when you’re a few feet away. It’s an incredible shark.”\\n  ',\n",

       "  'contents': ' \\n      Rapid melting of West Antarctica’s ice shelves may now be unavoidable as human-caused global warming accelerates, with potentially devastating implications for sea level rise around the world, new research has found.  \\n   \\n      Even if the world meets ambitious targets to limit global heating, West Antarctica will experience substantial ocean warming and ice shelf melting, according to the new study published Monday in the journal Nature Climate Change.\\n   \\n      Ice shelves are tongues of ice that jut out into the ocean at the end of glaciers. They act like buttresses, helping hold ice back on the land, slowing its flow into the sea and providing an important defense against sea level rise. As ice shelves melt, they thin and lose their buttressing ability. \\n   \\n      While there has been growing evidence ice loss in West Antarctica may be irreversible, there has been uncertainty about how much can be prevented through climate policies.\\n   \\n      The researchers looked at “basal melting,” when warm ocean currents melt the ice from beneath. They analyzed the rate of ocean warming and ice shelf melting under different climate change scenarios. These ranged from the ambitious, where the world manages to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, to the worst-case, where humans burn large amounts of planet-heating fossil fuels. \\n   \\n      They found if the world limits temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius, which it is not on track to do, climate change could still cause the ocean to warm at three times the historical rate.\\n   \\n      Even significantly cutting planet-heating pollution now will have “limited power” to prevent warmer oceans from triggering the collapse of the West Antarctic ice sheet, the report found.\\n   \\n      “It appears that we may have lost control of the West Antarctic ice melting over the 21st century,” said Kaitlin Naughten, an ocean modeler with the British Antarctic Survey and lead author of the study.   \\n   \\n      West Antarctica is already the continent’s largest contributor to global sea level rise and has enough ice to raise sea levels by an average of 5.3 meters, or more than 17 feet. It’s home to the Thwaites Glacier, also known as the “Doomsday glacier,” because its collapse could raise sea levels by several feet, forcing coastal communities and low-lying island nations to either build around sea level rise or abandon these places, Naughten said.\\n   \\n      While the study focused on ice shelf melting and did not directly quantify the impacts on sea level rise, “we have every reason to expect that sea level rise would increase as a result, as West Antarctica speeds up this loss of ice into the ocean,” Naughten said.  \\n   \\n      Ted Scambos, a glaciologist at the University of Colorado Boulder who was not involved with the study, said the findings are “sobering.” They build on existing research that paints an alarming picture of what’s happening to the planet’s southernmost continent, he told CNN. \\n   \\n      “The thing that’s depressing is the committed nature of sea level rise, particularly for the next century,” Scambos told CNN. “People who are alive today are going to see a significant increase in the rate of sea level rise in all the coastal cities around the world.” \\n   \\n      The only way to really stop the rapid ice melting, Scambos said, would be not just to cut levels of planet-heating pollution but also to “remove some that has already built up.” This will be “a real challenge,” he said.  \\n   \\n      Some scientists sounded a note of caution about the study. Tiago Segabinazzi Dotto, senior research scientist at the National Oceanography Centre in the UK, said it should be “treated carefully” as it is based on a single model.\\n   \\n      However, its conclusions do agree with previous research in the region, he told the Science Media Center, giving “confidence that this study needs to be taken in consideration for policymakers.”\\n   \\n      Naughten and her colleagues acknowledged their study has limits — predicting future rates of melting in West Antarctica is very complex and it’s impossible to account for every possible future outcome. But, looking at the range of scenarios, the report authors said they were confident the melting of ice shelves is now unavoidable.\\n   \\n      “The question of doom and gloom is something I’ve spent a lot of time thinking about with this study, because how do you tell such a bad news story?” Naughten said.\\n   \\n      “Conventional wisdom is supposed to give people hope, and I don’t see a lot of hope in this story,” she added, “but it’s what the science tells me and it’s what I have to communicate to the world.” \\n   \\n      West Antarctic ice shelf melting is one impact of climate change “we are probably just going to have to adapt to and that very likely means some amount of sea level rise we cannot avoid,” Naughten said. \\n   \\n      But although the outlook is dire, humanity cannot give up on slashing fossil fuel emissions, Naughten said.

       " {'headline': '\\n      ‘I reached for gum and felt my gun’: Hong Kong court acquits US politician over airport firearms charge\\n    ',\n",
       "  'contents': ' \\n A Hong Kong court has dropped charges against an American politician who turned himself in to customs authorities after bringing a gun into the city’s airport in what he called “an honest mistake.”\\n   \\n      Washington State Senator Jeff Wilson appeared at the West Kowloon Magistrates’ Court on Monday and was acquitted of “possession of arms without a license.”\\n   \\n      Instead he was given a 24-month “bind-over” where the charge was withdrawn and the defendant agreed to a good behavior order. Wilson’s firearm was also confiscated.\\n   \\n      Both prosecution and defense lawyers argued that this was a special case, citing Wilson’s self-declaration at the Hong Kong customs and his admission to possessing a firearm by mistake during questioning.\\n   \\n      The Republican state senator, whose full name is Stephen Jeffrey Wilson, also has a clear record in the city and had an open manner throughout the investigation, the court heard.\\n   \\n      “Based on the limited evidence available, I believe the defendant is innocent,” said magistrate Don So.\\n   \\n      So added that that since Wilson was a trade delegate and traveled frequently in the region, he believed the state senator “should have known Chinese and Hong Kong laws are very strict.”\\n   \\n      The conditions for the “bind-over” order include abstaining from possessing firearms and ammunition for 24 months. Repeated offenses would lead to a HK$2,000 (about $250) fine and further prosecution.\\n   \\n      After the court’s decision, Wilson’s office issued a statement saying the state senator had “inadvertently” brought the unloaded revolver on an international flight and acknowledged responsibility.\\n   \\n      “The mistake, after all, was fully mine. I am relieved we were able to resolve this matter efficiently, and I want to apologize for the concern I created,” Wilson said.\\n   \\n      He also gave more details on how he came to discover he had an unloaded gun onboard a plane, which was apparently not spotted by airport security checks in the United States.\\n   \\n      “I packed quickly and failed to check the contents of my briefcase. Over the Pacific, I reached into my briefcase for gum and felt my gun instead. My heart sank. I understood immediately what had happened, and that my only option was to report to the proper authorities, cooperate fully, and respect the laws of the land where my plane was about to touch down,” he said.\\n   \\n      Wilson’s passport was returned to him and he will resume travels with his wife in Southeast Asia, the statement added.\\n   \\n      Wilson also said the authorities in Hong Kong had “conducted themselves in a professional manner.”\\n   \\n      The court heard that on October 21, Wilson arrived in the Chinese territory with his wife after catching a connecting flight in San Francisco from Portland.\\n   \\n      He approached the customs channel at the Hong Kong International Airport less than 30 minutes after he landed, and “on his own initiative” informed officers that there was a gun in his bag. Wilson was arrested as he could not provide any valid license to carry arms in Hong Kong.\\n   \\n      The senator\\xa0said the ordeal was an “honest mistake” and he “hopes to resume his itinerary when the matter is resolved,” according to a statement posted by his office on October 23.\\n   \\n      Wilson also noted\\xa0in his statement\\xa0that his gun was registered in Washington state and that he holds a concealed firearms license.\\n   \\n      “I think we all can learn from what happened here,” Wilson said Monday. “First, of course, to always check your carry-on baggage before you go through airport security. But more important, when you make a mistake like this one, the right thing to do is to show respect and accept responsibility.”\\n  ',\n",

       "  'contents': ' \\n      Days after the nation’s deadliest mass shooting of the year left 18 dead and the subsequent manhunt for the gunman shook Maine, a series of shootings over Halloween weekend killed at least 12 people and wounded dozens across several states.\\n   \\n      The rampage at a bowling alley and a restaurant in Lewiston, Maine, also wounded 13. An intensive 48-hour search for the shooter shuttered schools and kept residents behind locked doors as police searched for the gunman, whose body was found Friday inside a recycling facility box trailer.\\n   \\n      The attack was among at least 583 mass shootings — where four or more are shot excluding the shooter — that have been recorded this year across the country, according to the\\xa0Gun Violence Archive.\\n   \\n      Thirteen of those shootings were recorded over the weekend alone, according to the archive.\\n   \\n      In\\xa0Indianapolis, a Halloween party ended with one person killed and nine others injured when shots were fired early Sunday,\\xa0according to local police.\\n   \\n      Then, a dispute between two groups erupted in gunfire as hundreds of people were filing out of the bars and nightclubs in Tampa, Florida, just before 3 a.m. Sunday, authorities said.\\n   \\n      The shooting left two people dead and injured 16 others, ranging in age from 18-27 years old, authorities said. A 22-year-old suspect has been arrested and charged with second degree murder in the shooting, Tampa police said.\\n   \\n      “Lives lost and others forever changed. To what end?” Tampa\\xa0Mayor Jane Castor said in a statement on X. “Bad decisions made in a split second and the proliferation of readily available guns are responsible for these almost daily incidents.”\\n   \\n      Over 1,000 miles to the north, at least 15 people were also shot early Sunday on Chicago’s west side, police said, at an event\\xa0CNN affiliate WLS\\xa0described as a large Halloween party.\\n   \\n      Responding officers saw someone “shooting into the location where a gathering was taking place,” according to the\\xa0Chicago Police Department. The person ran but was apprehended by officers a short distance away, authorities said.\\n   \\n      In Kansas, two men were killed and two others were injured in a shooting following an altercation at a Dodge City restaurant and bar early Sunday, police said. A suspect was arrested later Sunday after fleeing to Oklahoma, according to Dodge City police.\\n   \\n      In Lake Charles, Louisiana, a weekend house party ended with six people shot after a fight broke out, deputies said. The injured were all between the ages of 15 and 19, and a 17-year-old was taken into custody in connection with the shooting, according to the Calcasieu Parish Sheriff’s Office.\\n   \\n      “This was a\\xa0party\\xa0full of\\xa0teenagers.\\xa0Once again we have to figure out how these weapons are getting in the hands of our kids,” Sheriff Tony Mancuso said in a statement.\\n   \\n      Officers in Cumberland, Maryland, responded to a “chaotic scene” early Saturday where a shooting in an alley killed a 17-year-old boy and left three other people injured.\\n   \\n      In Delaware, a 21-year-old woman was struck and killed by a bullet as she was getting into her car at a strip mall, police said. A fight broke out at a Halloween party late Saturday nightat one of the businesses in the strip mall and reportedly continued into the parking lot, where shots were fired.\\n   \\n      The weekend’s gun violence comes as America’s\\xa0scourge\\xa0of mass shootings drags on. The restaurant and bowling alley in Maine now join the list of ordinary places throughout the country that became mass shooting scenes this year, including a Nashville school, a Louisville bank, a California dance hall and a Texas outlet mall.\\n   \\n      Nearly 1 in 5 US adults has reported having a family member killed by a gun, including by homicide and suicide, according to a survey\\xa0published in April by the Kaiser Family Foundation. About as many adults have been personally threatened with a gun, and about 1 in 6 adults has witnessed an injury from a shooting, the survey says.\\n   \\n      After the suspect in\\xa0Maine’s mass shooting was found dead Friday, President Joe Biden reiterated his call to Congress to address gun violence.\\n   \\n      “Americans should not have to live like this,” he said in the statement. “I once again call on\\xa0Republicans in Congress\\xa0to fulfill their obligation to keep the American people safe. Until that day comes, I will continue to do everything in my power to end this gun violence epidemic. The Lewiston community – and all Americans – deserve nothing less.”\\n   \\n      A 13-year-old lost both of her\\xa0parents\\xa0over the weekend after all three family members were shot during an argument at a San Antonio\\xa0house\\xa0party, authorities said.\\n   \\n      Officers responded to a call about the shooting at about 9:40 p.m. Saturday and discovered five people had been shot, the San Antonio\\xa0Police\\xa0Department told CNN on Sunday.\\n   \\n      A 20-year-old man was\\xa0in\\xa0the front yard of the\\xa0party\\xa0and pulled out a gun during an argument, shooting a mother, father and\\xa0their\\xa013-year-old\\xa0daughter, police said. The father then took out a gun and shot back at the man, the department said.\\n   \\n      The father, 40, and mother, 35, both died at the scene.\\xa0Their\\xa0daughter\\xa0was taken to a hospital with non-life-threatening\\xa0injuries, according to police.\\n   \\n      The\\xa0initial shooter and his relative were also both shot and transferred to a hospital with non-life-threatening\\xa0injuries,\\xa0police\\xa0said.\\n   \\n      The 20-year-old is facing charges of capital murder\\xa0of multiple persons and one count of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, according to police and court records.\\n   \\n      That same night, about 400 miles away in Texarkana, Texas, three people died and three others were wounded in a shooting after a “fist fight” broke out between two men at a party in the back room of a business, according to the\\xa0Texarkana\\xa0Police Department.\\n   \\n      One man died at the scene, according to the release, and a woman and another man died at an area hospital.\\n   \\n      Authorities were still working to “determine exactly what happened and who all was involved,” Texarkana police said in a news release.\\n   \\n      In Atlanta, a shooting near the Georgia State University campus early Sunday left four injured, according to Atlanta police. A large crowd was gathered in the area prior to the shooting, police said.\\n   \\n      Two of the injured were students, Georgia State University President M. Brian Blake said in a statement.\\n   \\n      Authorities are still working to uncover what motivated the deadly attacks in Maine, and digging into the history of the suspect, 40-year-old Robert Card.\\n   \\n      As details emerge of serious warning signs about Card known to authorities before the shooting, questions have arisen about the potential lack of follow-through by authorities.\\n   \\n      After Card fled the scene Wednesday, officers began a two-day manhunt for the gunman that ended with his body being found inside a box trailer sitting in an overflow parking lot of Maine Recycling Corporation in Lisbon, Maine Public Safety Commissioner Michael Sauschuck said at a Saturday news conference.\\n   \\n      Card had recently been fired from the recycling center, a law enforcement source told CNN.\\n   \\n      Law enforcement officials say Card, a US Army reservist and certified firearms instructor, had extensive training, including\\xa0land navigation and firearms.\\n \\n      The Maine National Guard asked local police to check on the gunman after a soldier became concerned he would “snap and commit a mass shooting,” according to information shared with CNN.\\n \\n      Officers from the Sagadahoc County and Kennebec County Sheriff’s Offices responded and tried to contact Card on September 16, less than six weeks before Wednesday’s massacre, documents say, according to a law enforcement source.\\n   \\n      Nearly three months before Wednesday’s shootings, Card tried to buy a firearm silencer from\\xa0Coastal Defense Firearms in Auburn, Maine, but the owner of the store, Rick LaChapelle, refused to let Card complete the purchase after he disclosed on a form he had mental health issues,\\xa0The New York Times\\xa0reported.\\n   \\n      Investigators are reviewing Card’s social media footprint as they probe for motive, and also working to establish a timeline up to the point he was found dead, law enforcement sources told CNN on Friday.\\n   \\nCNN’s Raja Razek, Jennifer Henderson, Paradise Afshar, Macie Goldfarb, Andy Rose, Shimon Prokupecz, Mark Morales, Linh Tran, Rachel Clarke, John Miller and Deidre McPhillips contributed to this report.\\n',\n",

       "  'contents': ' \\n      An 18th century bust bought for £5 ($6) nearly 100 years ago by a Scottish town council could sell for more than £2.5 million ($3 million).\\n   \\n      The bust of landowner and lawmaker John Gordon was sculpted by noted French artist Edmé Bouchardon.\\n   \\n      Now, local politicians on Invergordon Town Council are weighing up whether to sell the item, described by Sotheby’s as “brilliant in execution,” according to a council report.\\n   \\n      A private individual has already approached Sotheby’s with an offer to purchase the sculpture, the report said, adding that Sotheby’s experts believe it has reached its peak value.\\n   \\n      Members of the council will decide the bust’s future on Monday, a statement said, and funds from the sale could then be used to “reactivate” the Invergordon Common Good Fund, for the “benefit of the community,” the report added, though a full consultation with the community would precede any sale.\\n   \\n      First displayed in the town hall, the bust was initially valued not for the talent of its sculptor but for its depiction of Gordon, who was said to be the founder of Invergordon – the small Scottish coastal town situated about 300 kilometers (180 miles) north of the capital Edinburgh.\\n   \\n      Using a style not widely popularized until many years later, Bouchardon sculpted the bust in 1728 while he was a resident in Rome and Gordon was on his Grand Tour, a European tour undertaken by young, aristocratic and predominantly English men in the 18th and 19th centuries that served as a rite of passage.\\n   \\n      Among his other accomplishments, Bouchardon was a sculptor to Louis XV and his 17-foot sculpture of the French king used to stand in the Place de la Concorde in Paris before it was destroyed during the French Revolution.\\n   \\n      Despite its illustrious creator, there are few details publicly available about where the bust has been since it was purchased by the council.\\n   \\n      According to one local councilor, the sculpture was found on an industrial estate in 1998. Maxine Smith\\xa0told The Scotsman\\xa0in 2016 that she stumbled upon the bust 25 years ago when it was being used to hold open a door while she was searching for old robes.\\n   \\n      “I managed to get the key from the council. I found the robes and there was this bust just propping the door open,” she said.\\n   \\n      “The insurance team got in and we found that it was worth so much money. Back then it was worth about £200,000.”\\n   \\n      Once the bust was rediscovered and identified, it was displayed at both the Louvre Museum in Paris and the Getty Center in Los Angeles, the council said.\\n   \\n      Back in Scotland, however, it remains under secure storage in Inverness Museum & Art Gallery due to the security risks of displaying it.\\n  ',\n",

       "  'contents': \" \\n      The US Army asked local police to check on the reservist who killed 18 people after a soldier became concerned he would “snap and commit a mass shooting,” according to information shared with CNN.\\n   \\n      Officers from the Sagadahoc County and Kennebec County Sheriff’s Offices responded and tried to contact Robert Card on September 16, less than six weeks before last Wednesday’s massacres in a bowling alley and a bar, documents say, according to a law enforcement source.\\n   \\n      The information obtained by CNN describes how the Sagadahoc County sergeant called for backup, tried without success to talk to the reservist and then received disturbing details from the Army and the shooter’s family.\\n   \\n      The responding sergeant from the Sagadahoc County Sheriff’s Office was told “when [he] answers the door at his trailer, in the past he usually does so with a handgun in hand out of view from the person outside,” according to the source familiar with the welfare check report.\\n   \\n      The responding officer learned later in a letter from the Army that a soldier “is concerned that [the reservist] is going to snap and commit a mass shooting,” according to the report filed in connection with the wellness check.\\n   \\n      The 40-year-old went on two shooting rampages in Lewiston, Maine, on Wednesday night, killing 18 people at Just-in-Time Recreation and at Schemengees Bar & Grille.\\n   \\n      The initial panic was followed by 48 hours of fear and lockdown before he was found on Friday night, dead from an apparently self-inflicted gunshot wound, about 10 miles away.\\n   \\n      CNN’s reporting raises new questions about the lack of follow-through to make sure the man was not a danger despite serious warning signs that were known by authorities and are now being publicized for the first time.\\n   \\n      The welfare report detailed to CNN repeatedly cited the Maine National Guard as the source of the concerns and the troubling information about the shooter’s actions. The Maine National Guard did not respond to requests for comment before this story’s initial publication, but on Monday said they were not involved.\\n   \\n      “[The shooter] was not a member of, nor had he ever served in the Maine National Guard,” an emailed statement read. “All inquiries about his service record should be directed to the US Army Reserve.”\\n   \\n      Separately, the US Army answered a CNN request for information, again after this story first appeared, to say the health and wellness check was requested by the shooter’s unit “out of an abundance of caution after the unit became concerned for his safety.” The email statement from Army spokesperson Lt. Col. Ruth Castro continued:\\u202f“The Army takes all allegations seriously. Due to an ongoing Army investigation, we cannot go into any further details.”\\n   \\n      Maine has a “yellow flag” law that can be used to assess an individual with access to weapons. The first step is for law enforcement to take someone believed to be dangerous into custody and then have them evaluated by a medical professional. After a diagnosis, a judge can approve an order to temporarily remove firearms, according to the law.\\n   \\n      A File 6 missing person’s report appears to have been generated by the Sagadahoc sergeant who tried to check on the man, the source told CNN, but it is unclear if there was any\\xa0action in regard to the shooter’s access to weapons. The source said the case appeared to have been closed on October 1, 24 days before the massacres.\\n   \\n      CNN started raising questions about what information law enforcement in the state had about threats and the mental health condition of the shooter on Thursday. But when CNN asked State Public Safety Commissioner Mike Sauschuck about it, he replied: “I won’t answer.”\\n   \\n      He continued: “Based on what I’ve seen, we’re going to continue to work through that.”\\n   \\n      A spokesperson for the state police on Sunday said the organization was the lead agency for the manhunt and homicide investigations but no other aspect, directing CNN to ask questions about what was known before to Sagadahoc County Sheriff Joel Merry.\\n   \\n      “The Department of Public Safety (DPS) nor the Maine State Police requested a teletype on Robert Card prior to October 26. It should also be noted that no bulletins or assistance was requested from MSP’s Maine information and analysis center. DPS has no regulatory authority over law-enforcement agencies in Maine,” she said, declining to give any elaboration.\\n   \\n      CNN was unable to reach Merry on Sunday. A woman who answered the door at his home said he was “done,” indicating he did not want to speak.\\n   \\n      CNN also tried to request comments on this story from the shooter’s family, who did not respond.\\n   \\n      Nearly three months before Wednesday’s attacks, the shooter tried to buy a firearm silencer from\\xa0Coastal Defense Firearms in Auburn, Maine, but the owner of the store, Rick LaChapelle, refused to let him complete the purchase after he disclosed on a form that he had mental health issues, The New York Times reported.\\n   \\n      Soon after the reservist was identified as the suspect, his mental health struggles were also reported.\\n   \\n      According to information apparently supplied to Sagadahoc County Sheriff’s Office, the man spent 14 days at a psychiatric hospital in July before being released.\\n   \\n      That hospital stay was prompted after he had trouble with other soldiers in New York state in July.\\n   \\n      The Sagadahoc sheriff’s office report recorded the Army reservist had begun hearing insulting voices in the spring, and they had only gotten worse, attributing that to information supplied by the National Guard, though it appears it came from the Army.\\n   \\n      On July 15 near West Point, he and other soldiers “had gone to a convenience store to get some beer,” according to information shared with CNN, quoting a letter supplied by the military.\\n   \\n      “In the parking lot [he] accused three of them of calling him a pedophile and said he would take care of it,” it went on. “One of the soldiers who had been friends with [him] for a long time was there. [He] got in his face, shoved him, and told him to stop calling him a pedophile.”\\n   \\n      The law enforcement source told CNN they said they calmed their comrade down, got back to the motel, where he locked himself in his room and would not respond.\\n   \\n      The next day, another soldier got the key to his room and saw him. “[He] told me to leave him alone and tried to slam the door in my face,” the report quoted him as saying, adding the soldier took the man to a base hospital where a psychologist determined he needed further treatment, which led to the 14-day psychiatric stay.\\n   \\n      After his release, there was another incident that led to the Army calling for a well-being check.\\n   \\n      The man and a friend who was a soldier were driving home from a casino when he started talking about people calling him a pedophile, the National Guard statement to Sagadahoc County Sheriff’s Office said.\\n   \\n      “When [his friend] told him to knock it off because he was going to get into trouble talking about shooting up places and people, [he] punched him,” the statement said. “According to [the friend], [he] said he has guns and is going to shoot up the drill center at Saco and other places … [the friend] is concerned that [he] is going to snap and commit a mass shooting.”\\n   \\n      The threat to the military facility in Saco led to some extra patrols, Saco Police Chief Jack Clements told WMTW Maine, but the troubled reservist never showed up.\\n   \\n      Sagadahoc County Sheriff Merry told The New York Times he sent an alert to all law enforcement agencies in Maine sometime in September after learning of the threat to the Saco base.\\n   \\n      CNN had not been able to independently verify that.\\n   \\n      Merry told The Associated Press it was the Army Reserve who tipped him off to the possible danger.\\n   \\n      Investigators said the shooter already had the high-powered Ruger SFAR rifle later used in the killings by then, having bought it and a Beretta 92-F 9 mm semi-automatic pistol earlier in July.\\n   \\n      When the Sagadahoc and Kennebec officers were deployed to his home on September 16, they did not make contact with the shooter but soon learned of his mental health problems and his guns, the law enforcement source told CNN.\\n   \\n      The reservist would not answer the door to officers, the source said, so officers started to make calls to those who knew him.\\n   \\n      The unit commander told one officer the man no longer had any military-issued weapons and arrangements had been made with his brother who had retrieved his personal firearms.\\n   \\n      The commander also reportedly told the officer he thought it best to let the man have time to himself.\\n   \\n      The following day, the Sagadahoc officer spoke with the shooter’s brother, who warned him that the man would likely be armed if he did answer the door.\\n   \\n      “I was later contacted by [the brother], he told me that between him and his father they would work to ensure that [the man] does not have access to any firearms. They have a way to secure his weapons,” the source quoted from a welfare check report.\\n   \\n      The responding police officer said he told the brother that the intention was to make sure his sibling did not hurt himself or others. He said his department would help to facilitate a mental health evaluation if needed.\\n   \\n      That was on September 17. Thirty-eight days later, the Army reservist walked into a bowling alley and started shooting.\\xa0A 14-year-old boy playing with his father and contestants in a cornhole tournament for the deaf were among those killed. He then went to a bar and killed more, including the manager who tried to stop him.\\n   \\n  Correction: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated Robert Card's military status. He was a US Army reservist. The article also cited a police report that incorrectly identified who asked authorities to check on the reservist; it was the US Army.\\n\",\n",

       "  'contents': ' \\nChina is hosting defense officials from across the world for its flagship military diplomacy conference this week – a key opportunity for Beijing to promote its alternative vision for global security that has also underscored its increasing alignment with Moscow against the United States.\\n   \\n      More than 30 defense ministers and military chiefs, as well as lower-level representatives from dozens more countries and organizations, including the US, gathered for the three-day Xiangshan Forum in the Chinese capital.\\n   \\n      Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu was given prominent billing as the first visiting official to address the forum Monday, where he and China’s keynote speaker both took aim at what they see as a failed US-led security system.\\n   \\n      Noticeably missing from the line-up was China’s own defense minister.\\n   \\n      Beijing last week announced it had removed defense minister Li Shangfu from his position, without naming a replacement or providing an explanation for the sudden demotion – the latest in a series of high-level shakeups under Chinese leader Xi Jinping.\\n   \\n      The Xiangshan Forum – billed as an opportunity for countries to resolve differences regarding defense and security issues – also comes amid heightened concerns about the potential for the Israel-Hamas war to spiral in a wider regional conflict and as Russia continues its onslaught on Ukraine.\\n   \\n      Beijing has tried to project itself as a potential peacemaker in both conflicts, as it aims to cast itself as a player in global security amid heightened tensions with Washington.\\n   \\n      That bid has drawn skepticism from governments in its own region and the West, given its aggression in the South China Sea and intimidation of Taiwan, as well as its backing of Russia despite its unprovoked invasion of Ukraine.\\n   \\n      Both conflicts, however, were only briefly mentioned in a keynote address from top Communist Party military official Gen. Zhang Youxia, who repeated China’s calls for a “political resolution” for the “Ukraine crisis” and the “Israel-Palestine conflict.”\\n   \\n      Zhang, who is vice chairman of Central Military Commission\\xa0– a powerful body headed by Chinese leader Xi Jinping who ultimately commands China’s armed forces – instead focused his address on hailing Xi’s “Global Security Initiative” as a solution to global conflict – while making veiled jabs against the United States, which he did not directly name.\\n   \\n      “Our world is overshadowed by the dark cloud of cold war mentality and we must avoid falling into bloc confrontation,” Zhang told his audience, using language typically employed by Beijing to criticize Washington and its allies.\\n   \\n      “If a country only cares about its own interest it will perceive everyone else as a rival, if it is obsessed with suppressing others with different opinions it will surely cause conflicts and wars in the world,” he said.\\n   \\n      Zhang, who ranks higher than defense minister, also said countries should instead focus on “common security” and respecting each other’s paths of development – key tenants stressed in Xi’s security initiative, which the leader announced last year.\\ufeff \\n \\n      The general also said Beijing would “show no mercy” against any moves for Taiwan independence, referring to the self-governing island China’s ruling Communist Party claims as its own.\\n   \\n      China would continue to “deepen strategic coordination” with Russia’s military, and it was willing, Zhang added, to develop China-US military relations.\\n   \\n      His speech was followed by a pointed address by Russia’s Shoigu - a key architect of Moscow’s faltering invasion of Ukraine that still rages 20 months on in what is Europe’s fiercest fighting since World War Two.\\n   \\n      During his speech Shoigu accused NATO of “covering its real intention” to increase its presence in the Asia-Pacific and of promoting an arms race in the region, echoing China’s typical talking points.\\n   \\n      “To maintain its geopolitical and strategic dominance, the US is deliberately undermining the basis of international security and strategic stability, including arms control, and undermining the legitimate rights and interests of Russia for its own security,” Shoigu said.\\n   \\n      Security coordination between China and Russia has tightened in recent years amid rising tensions between each with the US and its allies. Beijing has repeatedly said it will not provide lethal aid to Russia’s war effort, but has continued to participate in joint military drills and other security coordination, while providing a key lifeline for the Russian economy since its invasion of Ukraine last year.\\n   \\n      The Russian defense minister’s appearance followed a visit from Russian President Vladimir Putin in Beijing earlier this month, where he took the place of prominence next to Xi at the leader’s Belt and Road Forum.\\n   \\n      The security forum also comes as the US and China are attempting to navigate their contentious relationship that includes frictions over Taiwan and Beijing’s aggression in the South China Sea. A potential meeting between Xi and US President Joe Biden in the United States next month is seen by both sides as an important opportunity to stabilize ties.\\n   \\n      Beijing severed high-level military dialogue with Washington last August in retaliation for a visit from then-US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to Taiwan.\\n   \\n      Its officials have declined American outreach for high level meetings, in what was widely seen as a protest against sanctions Washington placed on former defense minister Li in 2018, prior to his time as defense minister, for weapons purchases from Russia.\\n   \\n      Chinese defense ministry spokesperson Wu Qian said at a regular press conference last week that Chinese officials would “have exchanges” with the US delegation.\\n   \\n      “China attaches great importance to the development of military relations between China and the United States,” Wu said at the time, adding he hoped for a “favorable atmosphere for the healthy and stable development” of their military relations, according to state media.\\n   \\n      The forum was attended by a delegation from the US defense department led by Xanthi Carras, China country director in the Office of the Undersecretary of Defense.\\n  ',\n",

       " {'headline': '\\n      Authorities investigating online threats of violence against Jewish students at Cornell University, school’s president says\\n    ',\n",
       "  'contents': ' \\n      Cornell University police are investigating a series of antisemitic threats made against the school’s Jewish community in online posts over the weekend, its president announced.\\n   \\n      “Earlier today, a series of horrendous, antisemitic messages threatening violence to our Jewish community and specifically naming 104 West — the home of the Center for Jewish Living — was posted on a website unaffiliated with Cornell,” President Martha E. Pollack said in a statement Sunday.\\n   \\n      The online messages surfaced Sunday and included threats to shoot Jewish students at the 104 West building, which houses their kosher dining hall, and messaging encouraging others to harm Jews, according to the school’s student newspaper, The\\xa0Cornell\\xa0Daily Sun.\\n   \\n      The threats come amid rising tensions on college campuses across the US as the war between Israel and Hamas rages on in the Middle East. At many universities, students are engaging in fervent protests as some administrators — including those at elite institutions such as Harvard and the University of Pennsylvania — grapple with how to acknowledge students’ wide-ranging concerns while also fielding backlash from influential donors demanding colleges take a clearer stance on the conflict.\\n   \\n      Antisemitic incidents in the US increased nearly 400% in the days after the October 7 attacks by Hamas, according to the Anti-Defamation League.\\n   \\n      New York State police will increase their security on Cornell’s campus following the threats, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said Monday, calling those who made the threats, “terrorists” and warned that anyone making threats “will get no refuge.”\\n   \\n      Speaking alongside Pollack at Cornell’s Center for Jewish Living, Hochul said she had talked with Cornell students in response to the threats and said state police will be “increasing our (Cornell’s) security opportunities as well.”\\n   \\n      “I came here in person with one strong message: that we will not tolerate threats, or hatred or antisemitism or any kind of hatred that makes people feel vulnerable,” Hochul said.\\n   \\n      “If you’re going to engage in these harmful actions, hate crimes, breaking our laws, you will be caught and you will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,” the governor said.\\n   \\n      The university’s police department also said it increased patrols and has “arranged additional security for our Jewish students and organizations on and off campus, and the university is in constant communication with these groups.”\\n   \\n      The Biden administration is announcing new actions Monday aimed at combating antisemitic incidents on college campuses across the country in the wake of the Hamas terror attacks on Israel.\\n   \\n      In the Cornell incident, some of the usernames from those making the threats included the word Hamas, according to some of the posts published by the paper.\\n   \\n      The university’s police department is investigating the posts and the FBI was notified about the threats as a potential hate crime, Pollack said.\\n   \\n      “The FBI is aware of the threats made to Cornell University’s Jewish community,” the agency said in a statement.\\n   \\n      “We take all threats seriously and are working closely with Cornell and our law enforcement partners at every level to determine the credibility, share information, and take appropriate investigative action.”\\n   \\n      “We encourage members of the public to immediately report anything they consider suspicious to law enforcement,” the statement added. “Nothing is more important than the safety of our communities and we will not tolerate violence motivated by hate and extremism.”\\n   \\n      There are approximately 3,000 undergraduate and 500 graduate Jewish students at Cornell, comprising 22% of the student body.\\n   \\n      Authorities responded to 104 West — which houses the campus’ kosher and multicultural dining hall — and would remain there “to ensure our students and community members are safe,” the school’s president wrote Sunday.\\n   \\n      Cornell’s Jewish Hillel organization warned students and staff to avoid the building Sunday evening “out of an abundance of caution.”\\n   \\n      “Evidence suggests the targeted locations were intentionally selected because of the perpetrator’s bias,” Cornell University Police Department said in a statement.\\n   \\n      New York Attorney General Letitia James called the threats “horrific.”\\n   \\n      “There is no space for antisemitism or violence of any kind,” she wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter, on Sunday. “Campuses must remain safe spaces for our students.”\\n   \\n      Pollack said in her statement violent threats are “absolutely intolerable” and the university is working to prioritize community safety.\\n   \\n      The threats come just days after several sidewalks on campus were vandalized with anti-Israel graffiti, according to the\\xa0university’s student-run newspaper,\\xa0The Cornell Review.\\n   \\n      “We will not tolerate antisemitism at Cornell,” the president wrote. “The virulence and destructiveness of antisemitism is real and deeply impacting our Jewish students, faculty and staff, as well as the entire Cornell community. This incident highlights the need to combat the forces that are dividing us and driving us toward hate. This cannot be what defines us at Cornell.”\\n   \\n      Cornell senior Zoe Bernstein, who is Jewish, told CNN she was heartbroken to read the antisemitic posts, which she said have spread fear and distress throughout the campus’ Jewish community.\\n   \\n      “This is totally unprecedented in my life and the lives of, I would say, pretty much all of my peers. … It’s really, deeply troubling and upsetting,” said Bernstein, who is the president of Cornellians for Israel, a campus organization that aims to provide community and educational events for students who have a connection to Israel.\\n   \\n      Bernstein noted the threats are particularly disturbing for students like herself who are descendants of Holocaust and pogrom survivors.\\n   \\n      Concerns about the war coupled with the rising unease on campus have begun to consume the lives of many of Bernstein’s peers, she said.\\n   \\n      “It’s really, really hard to focus on anything other than all of this,” she said. “I just really hope that we can soon get to a point where things just die down and we can focus on our academics again because I know students from all walks of life have really been struggling.”\\n   \\n      “My ultimate wish is that no violence will happen on this campus,” she added.\\n   \\n      Cornell is located in Ithaca, New York — about 60 miles south of Syracuse.\\n  ',\n",
