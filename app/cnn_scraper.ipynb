       "[{'headline': '\\n      EU stops short of calling for ceasefire in Gaza ahead of UN vote as Gaza crisis escalates\\n    ',\n",
       "  'contents': ' \\n      European Union leaders have stopped short of calling for a ceasefire in Gaza, instead appealing\\xa0for humanitarian “pauses” to provide aid, as the UN warned its operations were being “paralyzed” by Israel’s bombardment of the besieged enclave.\\n   \\n      The communique, released after meetings Thursday in Brussels, follows several failed attempts by the UN Security Council to pass a resolution on the Israel-Hamas war, with member states preparing to vote on another draft resolution – this time put forward by Jordan on behalf of Arab states – on Friday.\\n   \\n      Jordan’s Foreign Minister\\xa0Ayman Safadi told diplomats gathered at the United Nations Assembly Hall that “collective punishment is not self-defense.” The resolution calls for a “cessation of hostilities,” the release of hostages, and the rejection of “any attempts at forced transfer of the Palestinian civilian population.”\\n   \\n      More than 2 million people trapped in Gaza are living through a deepening humanitarian crisis, hastened by daily airstrikes and an Israeli blockade of life-saving fuel. Israel says Hamas is stockpiling fuel for its own use and has called on the militant Palestinian group that governs Gaza to share it. Health services have been crippled by power shortages and hundreds of thousands of civilians have been forced to flee their homes amid the bombing.\\n   \\n      Israeli strikes have killed more than 7,028 people in Gaza, including thousands of children, since October 7, according to figures released Thursday by the Hamas-controlled Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza.\\n   \\n      Pressure is building on the international community to persuade Israel to allow\\xa0desperately needed aid\\xa0into Gaza; the United Nations and several countries in the region have called for an immediate ceasefire, while others advocate for a “humanitarian pause” in fighting.\\n   \\n      But the world has so far failed to unite around a common position on the crisis, nearly three weeks since the outbreak of violence, sparked by Hamas’ brutal October 7 terror attacks and kidnapping rampage that killed over 1,400 people in Israel and saw over 200 people taken to Gaza as hostages.\\n   \\n      Israeli ambassador to the UN Gilad Erdan on Thursday said requests for a ceasefire were “not an attempt for peace,” but “an attempt to tie Israel’s hands, preventing us from eliminating a huge threat to our citizens.”\\n   \\n      “Israel is not at war with human beings, we are at war with monsters,” he added, saying, “our goal is to completely eradicate Hamas’s capability and we will use every means at our disposal to accomplish this.”\\n   \\n      His comments came as Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said Israel’s forces are preparing for the “next\\xa0stages” in its war against Hamas, which is widely expected to come in the form of a ground incursion.\\n   \\n      “The maneuvering will begin when the conditions are right. These conditions are complex because so is the campaign. The troops are ready,” Gallant said in a briefing in Tel Aviv.\\n   \\n      For a second night, Israel’s military conducted “targeted raids” in northern Gaza overnight on Friday after vowing to continue ground raids over the coming days.\\n   \\n      The raids included aircraft and artillery strikes in the area of Shaja’iyah, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said. Video published by the IDF showed tanks and armored vehicles moving on a road near agricultural land as well as strikes on buildings and open areas.\\n   \\n      The incursions are intended to kill Hamas militants, lay the foundations for an all-out invasion and neutralize explosive devices and reconnaissance posts, IDF spokesperson Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said on Thursday.\\n   \\n      Meanwhile, six people were injured when a rocket struck the Red Sea resort city of Taba, in Egypt, early on Friday, according to official sources cited by Egypt-affiliated Al-Qahera News.\\n   \\n      The rocket hit an ambulance building and a residential area of the hospital’s administration in the city, which shares its border with Israel. It is unclear yet who fired the rocket.\\n   \\n      IDF spokesperson Daniel Hagari said at a press briefing Friday that Israel will cooperate with Egypt and the US to “tighten the defense in the region against threats from the Red Sea area.” Hagari said an aerial “threat” had been detected in the Red Sea area, which he said he believed was the cause of the strike in Egypt.\\n   \\n      The\\xa0health ministry\\xa0in\\xa0Hamas-controlled Gaza on Thursday published a 212-page report listing thousands of names described as\\xa0“documented deaths since October 7” in Gaza which it blamed on Israeli military “aggression.”\\n   \\n      The ministry said the death toll is likely to be much higher and said its report excludes casualties who have not been identified, those buried without being brought to hospital for registration, or those still missing – who number around 1,600.\\n   \\n      The list, which does not distinguish between combatants and non-combatants but which does list age, sex and the victim’s ID card number, followed US\\xa0President Joe Biden’s comments that he had “no confidence” in the figures of civilian casualties reported by the Gaza Health Ministry.\\n   \\n      Israel, along with the US, has expressed doubts about the casualty numbers being reported out of Gaza, but has not provided evidence that they are exaggerated.\\n   \\n      White House spokesman John Kirby called the Gaza-based ministry “a front for\\xa0Hamas,”\\xa0though when asked he did not dispute that thousands of Palestinians, many innocent civilians, had been killed.\\n   \\n      The prime minister of the US-backed Palestinian Authority in the West Bank, Mohammad Shtayyeh, said the PA’s own health authority considers the numbers to be “correct.”\\n   \\n      “They are our numbers,” Shtayyeh said in an interview Thursday with Al Jazeera. “These numbers are fed to us from the hospitals of Gaza every single day (and) are received by our Ministry of Health.”\\n   \\n      The Ramallah-based Palestinian Authority is run by a rival faction to\\xa0Hamas,\\xa0and\\xa0operates the umbrella Ministry of Health which maintains a relationship with the ministry in Gaza. Death tolls for Gaza are released both in Gaza and Ramallah daily.\\n   \\n      CNN is not able to independently verify the death toll tabulated in Gaza.\\n   \\n      Israel has also accused Hamas of controlling life-saving fuel supplies in Gaza, as basic services such as hospitals, bakeries and UN humanitarian operations are on the verge of shutting down due to a lack of fuel.\\n   \\n      Juliette Touma, the communications director for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), said the agency will be forced to halt operations altogether if it does not get enough fuel – crucial for generating power for hospitals and desalinating water.\\n   \\n      “UNRWA continues to struggle with very limited and dwindling fuel supplies,” Touma said.\\xa0“Rationing of deliveries continues, including to medical facilities and bakeries. UNRWA is being paralyzed due to the lack of fuel deliveries into the Gaza Strip.”\\n   \\n      The IDF said that the problem is not a lack of fuel in Gaza, but that it is in the hands of Hamas.\\n   \\n      IDF spokesperson Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus told CNN on Thursday that Hamas controls “between 800,000 and perhaps more than one million liters of fuel of different types stored inside Gaza,” according to Israeli military intelligence estimates.\\n   \\n      “Some of it was stockpiled before, some of it stolen from the UN, some of it’s stolen by Hamas from private vendors,” he said.\\n   \\n      CNN cannot independently verify the amount of fuel in Gaza.\\n   \\n      Israel continues to block deliveries of fuel altogether to Gaza, saying that Hamas would only divert it for military use.\\n   \\n      Speaking to CNN on Thursday, another UNRWA spokesperson, Tamara Alrifai, said, “Whether or not other sources of fuel exist in Gaza is of no direct relevance to us, we are a human agency and we should not be begging for fuel to nourish our own operations.”\\n   \\n      With fuel rapidly running out, UNWRA is being forced to make difficult decisions over\\xa0diverting power between bakeries and hospital wards with more than 600,000 people now displaced and relying on a single piece of bread each day, Alrifai added.\\n   \\n      Twelve aid trucks carrying water, food, medicine and medical supplies – but no fuel – entered Gaza from the Rafah border crossing with Egypt on Thursday, according to the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS).\\n   \\n      A total of 74\\xa0trucks have entered the strip since humanitarian\\xa0aid\\xa0transfers resumed several days ago, PRCS said.\\n   \\n      In normal times, the figure would be about 455 per day, the United Nations has said, meaning basic supplies are trickling into the enclave at a much slower pace than needed.\\n   \\n      The head of UNRWA warned the current aid provisions to Gaza were just for “show” and “nothing more than crumbs,” as he warned that hunger and disease were becoming major issues in the besieged enclave.\\n   \\n      “Over the last week, I followed closely the focus about the number of trucks entering\\xa0Gaza.\\xa0Many of us saw\\xa0in\\xa0these trucks a glimmer of hope. This is, however,\\xa0becoming\\xa0a distraction,” Philippe Lazzarini said at a press conference\\xa0in\\xa0Jerusalem on Friday.\\n   \\n      “We should avoid conveying the message that few trucks a day means the siege is lifted for humanitarian\\xa0aid. This is not true,” Lazzarini added. “The\\xa0current\\xa0system\\xa0in\\xa0place is geared to fail. What is needed is meaningful and non-interrupted\\xa0aid\\xa0flow.”\\n   \\n      Overcrowded hospitals on the brink of collapse say they are overwhelmed with the numbers of injured people and doctors have repeatedly told CNN they don’t have the supplies or the electricity to run critical functions to properly care for them.\\n   \\nThis story is developing and is being updated.\\n  ',\n",

       " {'headline': '\\n      Maine communities still grieving after shooting rampage are under stay-at-home orders as manhunt for suspect continues\\n    ',\n",
       "  'contents': ' \\n      As communities in Maine grieve 18 people killed in a shooting at a bowling alley and restaurant two days ago, officials still are imploring thousands of residents to shelter in place Friday while a massive search for a suspect continues.\\n   \\n      Authorities consider the suspect, Robert Card, armed and dangerous, and schools, businesses and other facilities have closed over safety concerns while hundreds of law enforcement officers swarm parts of southern Maine in Card’s pursuit.\\n   \\n      The horror began around 7 p.m. Wednesday in the city of Lewiston, where authorities say Card opened fire at Just-in-Time Recreation and then later at Schemengees Bar & Grille. In addition to the 18 people killed, 13 others were injured, Maine Gov. Janet Mills said Thursday.\\n   \\n      The shooting and subsequent manhunt spurred shelter-in-place orders for Androscoggin and northern Sagadahoc counties, which encompass Lewiston and the nearby Auburn and Lisbon communities.\\n   \\n      “Nerves are rattled right now – (I’m) keeping an eye on the woods,” said Cory, a Lisbon resident whose 10-year-old daughter was inside his home. “Seeing the cops coming around here, that makes me feel a million times better.”\\n   \\n      Wednesday night’s massacre appears to be the deadliest mass shooting in the United States this year. It is also the worst since a\\xa0gunman killed 19 students and two teachers at a school in Uvalde, Texas, last year. Overall, at least 566 mass shootings have happened this year across the country, with four or more shot excluding the shooter, according to the\\xa0Gun Violence Archive.\\n   \\n      Card, 40, faces an arrest warrant in eight counts of murder, police said. Authorities on Thursday at least twice converged on Card’s last known address, a home in Bowdoin, Maine, roughly 15 miles east of Lewiston.\\n   \\n      Thursday evening, investigators believed they detected something inside or near the home, spurring a flurry of activity, a law enforcement official said. A CNN crew there heard an officer say “come out with your hands up.” But that episode appeared to end uneventfully, with authorities leaving the scene two hours later and Maine State Police saying they were done there for the night.\\n   \\n      Earlier Thursday, investigators executed a search warrant at the residence, looking for computers, notes, weapons and any evidence that might indicate a plan for the shootings, law enforcement sources told CNN.\\n   \\n      In the suspect’s car – found abandoned some 8 miles from Lewiston in Lisbon, authorities said – investigators found a gun, a law enforcement official told CNN on Thursday. It has not been determined if the firearm was used in the shooting, the source said.\\n   \\n      Authorities are expected to return to Bowdoin to continue investigating Friday, Maine Department of Public Safety spokesperson Shannon Moss said.\\n   \\n      The search for Card could be complicated by his background in combat training. Card is a certified firearms instructor and a member of the US Army Reserve, law enforcement officials in Maine told CNN.\\n   \\n      Katherine Schweit, a former FBI senior official, said Thursday night that Card has an advantage.\\n   \\n      “He’s in his own backyard, and we’re coming into his own backyard to try to find him in a game of hide and seek. He knows what he’s looking for and where he’s going to go,” Schweit told CNN’s Kaitlan Collins on Thursday. “He has a plan, and law enforcement has to follow those trails wherever they can find them until he makes a decision to stop. So, if he keeps going, that’s just what we’re facing.”\\n   \\n      The names of some victims who were killed Wednesday night have been released.\\n   \\n      Tricia Asselin was a part time employee at the bowling alley, but she was there Wednesday night bowling recreationally when the shots rang out, according to her brother DJ Johnson.\\n   \\n      “What I’m told is that when it all started happening, she ran up to the counter and started to call 911, and that’s when she was shot,” Johnson told CNN on Thursday. “That was just her. She wasn’t going to run. She was going to try and help.”\\n   \\n      Asselin, 53, had a son who meant the world to her, Johnson said.\\n   \\n      “Her son was her entire life. From the day he was born to yesterday. She did everything for him … he was her world,” Johnson said.\\n   \\n      Asselin’s sister, Bobbi Nichols, also was at the bowling alley when the shooting happened, but she was able to flee the rampage, Johnson said. Tommy Conrad, a manager at the bowling alley, was killed Wednesday, his family confirmed to CNN affiliate WMTW. Conrad, 34, left behind a 9-year-old daughter.\\n   \\n      Bryan MacFarlane was playing in a cornhole tournament at the restaurant when he was killed Wednesday, his sister Keri Brooks told CNN.\\xa0\\xa0MacFarlan, part of the local deaf community, typically went to Schemengees on Wednesdays, when other deaf people gather to play the game, Brooks said. He leaves behind his mother and his sister.\\n   \\n      “I grew up in Maine and the deaf community is a tight-knit community,” Brooks said. “Not only was my brother slain, but my friends were too,” she said of the other victims she has learned about.\\n   \\n      MacFarlane, 40, was one of the first deaf people in Vermont to get his commercial trucking driver’s license, Brooks said.\\n   \\n      Peyton Brewer-Ross also was at that cornhole tournament when he was fatally shot, according to his brother Ralph Brewer. He enjoyed playing the game and spending time with friends at the restaurant.\\n   \\n      Brewer-Ross was a father of two children and “loved being a dad more than anything else,” his brother said, adding he had just celebrated his daughter’s second birthday a couple of weeks ago.\\n   \\n      “She woke up telling her mom, Rachel (Sloat), ‘Where’s daddy, where’s daddy?’” Brewer said. “At 2 years old, she isn’t going to remember any of this, but in the same breath, she isn’t going to have her dad be there the rest of her life.”\\n   \\n      The first 911 calls reporting a shooting came at 6:56 p.m. Wednesday from the bowling alley. Then about 12 minutes later, multiple 911 calls reported a shooting at the restaurant, roughly 4 miles away.\\n   \\n      As police arrived on scene, people were fleeing the bowling alley, video obtained by CNN shows. Another video showed a person on a stretcher taken to an ambulance.\\n   \\n      Nichols told CNN she and her sister were bowling in separate lanes when she heard a “bang” but didn’t know what was happening until she heard a second shot. Then she lost sight of her sister when everyone began frantically running away.\\n   \\n      “I couldn’t see her, and everybody was running. I got caught in people trampling and running out,” Nichols told CNN’s Jake Tapper on Thursday.\\n   \\n      Nichols said she ran as far as she could before finally reaching a fence and some trees, behind which she and others hid as they wondered what was going on. Two hours later, she later learned Asselin was killed trying to call 911.\\n   \\n      “When she called 911 to save everybody, she lost her life because of it. She was a great person,” Nichols said. “She was a hero.”\\n   \\n      Card is a petroleum supply specialist in the Army Reserve and first enlisted in 2002, according to records provided by the Army on Thursday.\\xa0\\n \\n      And while Card is a certified firearms instructor, law enforcement officials told CNN, his time in the Army did not include training as a firearms instructor “nor did he serve in that capacity for the Army,” spokesperson Bryce Dubee said in a statement to CNN.\\n   \\n      Still, Card had extensive training, including land navigation, making him “very comfortable in the woods,” said Clifford Steeves, who told CNN he knew Card when they both served in the Army Reserve.\\n   \\n      Steeves met Card in the early 2000s when they served together and knew him until about a decade ago, he said. Steeves didn’t witness any concerning behavior from Card, whom he described as an “outdoors type of guy.” He said Card is a skilled marksman who was one of the best shooters in his unit.\\n   \\n      “He was a very nice guy – very quiet. He never overused his authority or was mean or rude to other soldiers,” Steeves said. “It’s really upsetting.”\\n   \\n      Over the summer, Card was at the Camp Smith training facility in upstate New York, when he started making statements about hearing voices and having thoughts about wanting to hurt fellow soldiers, law enforcement sources told CNN’s John Miller. He received a command referral to a military hospital and spent a few weeks under evaluation, the sources said.\\n   \\n      Katie O’Neill, Card’s sister-in-law, told CNN he didn’t have a long history with mental health challenges.\\n   \\n      “This is something that was an acute episode. This is not who he is,” O’Neill said. “He is not someone who has had mental health issues for his lifetime or anything like that.”\\n   \\nCNN’s Shimon Prokupecz, John Miller, Travis Nichols, Amanda Jackson, David Williams, Caroll Alvarado, Eric Levenson, Maria Santana,\\xa0Haley Brtizky, Joe Sutton, Sara Smart, Brian Todd, Evan Perez, Macie Goldfarb, Maria\\xa0Sole\\xa0Campinoti, Andy Rose, Josh Campbell and Chris Boyette contributed to this report.\\n',\n",

       "  'contents': ' \\n  Editor’s Note: Sign up for CNN’s Meanwhile in China newsletter which explores what you need to know about the country’s rise and how it impacts the world.\\n \\n      Former Chinese Premier Li Keqiang, once seen as a reform-minded contender to the country’s top leadership role, died of a sudden heart attack early Friday in Shanghai, state media reported.\\n   \\n      He was 68 years old.\\n   \\n      Li, who was nominally China’s No. 2 leader until late last year, served as the country’s premier – traditionally in charge of the economy – for a decade from 2013 to March this year under strongman leader Xi Jinping.\\n   \\n      During his time in the role, Li navigated the world’s second-largest economy through a challenging period of rising technology and trade tensions with the United States, mounting government debt and unemployment, and the Covid-19 pandemic.\\n   \\n      In his final year in power, the economist by training had been a strong voice warning of challenges to China’s economy amid widespread Covid-19 lockdowns, while backing efforts to boost employment and maintain economic stability.\\n   \\n      Li, known to use his English language skills on occasion in appearances outside the mainland, was also seen as representing a different approach to China’s ties with the world, at a time when the country’s relations with the West have grown increasingly strained.\\n   \\n      “China and the United States have common interests,” Li said in response to CNN’s question at his annual press conference in March 2021. “The two countries need to put more energy on their common ground and expand converging interests.”\\n   \\n      As the news of Li’s death broke Friday morning, social media users circulated a line from Li’s yearly address to China’s rubber stamp parliament in 2022, where he pledged that, “No matter how the international environment may change, China will keep the course of wider openness.”\\n   \\n      Li, a highly educated technocrat with degrees in law and economics, was considered friendly to the private sector. He was also seen to have a diverging policy stance from Xi, who has tightened the ruling Chinese Communist Party’s control over the economy.\\n   \\n      Li oversaw much of China’s efforts to prop up economic growth during his decade-long tenure and remained a supporter of the global integration of China’s economy, even as he found himself increasingly sidelined by Xi.\\n   \\n      As international doubts grew in recent years over Beijing’s resolve to continue the “reform and opening” policy, Li had repeatedly told foreign corporate executives and local officials that such economic development remained the party’s priority.\\n   \\n      During the country’s Covid lockdowns, he held meetings instructing various government departments to clear logistical hurdles for foreign companies to resume production.\\n   \\n      “(Li) was the only member of the Politburo Standing Committee to have openly advocated for the continuation of (former leader) Deng Xiaoping’s open-door policy, which ran counter to the instincts of Xi Jinping,” said Willy Lam, a senior fellow at the Jamestown Foundation think tank in the US, pointing to Xi’s inclination toward state-controlled measures.\\n   \\n      Li is also remembered for his focus on addressing societal ills – with social media users on Friday also pointing to his comments noting that 600 million people in China – or roughly 40% of the population – still had a monthly income of 1,000 yuan ($137).\\n   \\n      Those remarks, made during the premier’s annual press conference in 2020, served as a reminder of China’s ongoing struggle to lift people out of poverty, even as Xi hailed China’s efforts in this regard as a point of national pride.\\n   \\n      During the pandemic, where Beijing’s policies brought large swathes of the country to a halt, Li called local officials to “earnestly” implement policies to stabilize the economy and support small businesses and employment.\\n   \\n      He was also the highest level official to visit Wuhan in January 2020, when the city was under lockdown and battling a surge of infections in the world’s first known Covid-19 outbreak.\\n   \\n      Some of Li’s efforts to bolster the economy appeared to underscore his rift with Xi, and the premier was widely seen as lacking power relative to many of his predecessors.\\n   \\n      When the premier called for the revival of street stalls as a way to jump start growth and fix a spiraling jobs crisis, his proposal met with criticism from a number of state media outlets.\\n   \\n      The backlash from party mouthpieces sparked speculation of conflict between the two most senior party figures over how to stimulate the economy amid strict pandemic controls.\\n   \\n      Li is widely seen as a protege of Xi’s predecessor, Hu Jintao, who presided over an era of rapid growth in China from 2002 to 2012. The men shared economic sensibilities and rose to power through the Communist Party’s Youth League, once seen as a training ground for future leaders.\\n   \\n      The faction was known for producing reform-minded leaders hailing from humble family backgrounds, but its influence is believed to have been crushed by Xi since he came to power.\\n   \\n      The relationship between Li and Hu was in the spotlight last year when the former top leader was unexpectedly led out of the closing ceremony of the October 2022 Communist Party Congress, where Xi further consolidated power.\\n   \\n      In a moment of drama during a usually highly choreographed event, Hu was escorted from the room, pausing on his way out to pat a stony-faced Li on the shoulder, who nodded and turned to watch the former leader depart. State media later suggested Hu left due to health issues.\\n   \\n      Under Hu, Li was named to the party’s top leadership body, the Politburo Standing Committee, in 2007.\\n   \\n      He previously held key roles as party chief in industrial Liaoning province and was provincial leader of Henan, an agricultural base.\\n   \\n      Born in Anhui, Li spent his late teens doing manual labor with the Dongling Production Brigade in the eastern province during the Cultural Revolution, a decade-long social and political upheaval launched by late Chinese leader Mao Zedong.\\n   \\n      Li was among the first batch of students to sit the college entrance exam after it was reinstated following the end of the Cultural Revolution. In 1978, he enrolled at the prestigious Peking University, where he studied law and later obtained a doctorate in economics.\\n   \\n      Unlike Xi, Li is not considered one of China’s princelings hailing from a prominent party family. He held positions in the Communist Youth League Central Committee during the 1980s and ’90s.\\n   \\n      His time in the top echelons of the party ended last October, when he was not named to its Central Committee during a twice-a-decade leadership reshuffle that saw Xi surround himself with key allies.\\n   \\n      Then 67, Li was one year short of the unofficial retirement age for senior Chinese Communist Party leaders.\\n   \\n      He was succeeded as premier earlier this year by former Shanghai party chief and Xi loyalist Li Qiang.\\n   \\n      Alfred Wu, an associate professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy at the National University of Singapore, said that Li’s exit from power meant that there were not many reform-minded senior cadres left in the leadership.\\n   \\n      “This is the hard reality we are going to face. China has departed from the future that Li’s vision had represented,” he said.\\n  ',\n",

       " {'headline': '\\n      ‘Everything is destroyed’: Civilians trickle out of Avdiivka as Russian assault leaves Ukrainian town in ruins\\n    ',\n",
       "  'contents': ' \\n      A Ukrainian police officer inspects a half-destroyed building when, suddenly, he rushes to the ground, ducking for cover.\\n   \\n      “Incoming,” he shouts to his partner, in body camera video seen by CNN, as a shell lands nearby. “There will be more.”\\n   \\n      There’s little to police these days in Avdiivka as most of the people who used to live in this frontline city are gone. But some 1,600 have remained, and this unit — the White Angels — are there to evacuate them to safety.\\n   \\n      “On average, we evacuate four people from Avdiivka per day,” Lieutenant Dmytro Soloviy, a member of the unit told CNN in a phone interview.\\n   \\n      The city had been left on the frontline when pro-Moscow separatists seized large portion of the Donbas region, including the nearby city of Donetsk, in 2014, and has been under fire since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022.\\n   \\n      But on October 10, Moscow began a concentrated push, sending waves of soldiers and armoured vehicles while also intensifying shelling of the city.\\xa0The attack on Avdiivka comes as the front lines of the war remain relatively static, with Ukraine’s counteroffensive continuing to move much more slowly than initially anticipated.\\n   \\n      Some analysts had initially suggested the Russian move was designed to force Kyiv to divert some of the forces it had been using for its attacks along the southern and eastern front lines, but Ukrainian officials say the goal is actually to make advances while Kyiv is focused elsewhere.\\n   \\n      “The situation is tense,” Soloviy said, explaining people can no longer leave on their own, they have to wait to be evacuated. “Because of the increased shelling, people have started to sign up more often (for evacuation).”\\n   \\n      Many of Avdiivka’s residents had already fled before the full-scale invasion, leaving the city with a pre-war population of around 30,000.\\n   \\n      “Most of the people remaining in the city are elderly, mostly men. They [stayed because] did not want to leave their homes,” Soloviy explained. “Now the situation is grim. Just so you understand, 10-15 bombs are dropped every day.”\\n   \\n      Between airstrikes and artillery, supply lines into the city have also slowed down and so Solviy’s unit has had to step in.\\n   \\n      “At the moment, we are the only ones bringing in the aid. We bring in humanitarian aid, bread, medicines,” he said. “We go every day, there are no days off.”\\n   \\n      “There used to be three grocery stores operating in Avdiivka. Two of them were destroyed by missiles. Now only one sad little grocery store is open,” he added. “There is nowhere to buy bread so once a week, we bring some so people can get bread.”\\n   \\n      When people began leaving Avdiivka in 2014, the Ukrainian military moved in, fortifying the city and building up its defenses, turning it into a stronghold.\\xa0\\xa0Nine years and a full-scale invasion later and the frontline near Avdiivka has barely shifted.\\n   \\n      Video of the White Angels unit driving into the city shows a city covered in yellow and blue. Dozens of Ukrainian flags dot the route, but so do crumbling walls and shattered windows - entire buildings, some several stories high, razed to the ground.\\n   \\n      “The situation has not changed radically - it is tough,” the head of the Avdiivka city military administration Vitalii Barabash said in daily update on Wednesday. “The defense line around the city and in the city itself is constantly under fire. (The Russians) are firing with everything they have.”\\n   \\n      Airstrikes, missiles and artillery, constantly pointed at the city and its surroundings. Russia has been able to make small gains west of Krasnohorivka, to the north of Aviidvka, but those marginal advances have come with a heavy price tag and Moscow’s still a long way off from its objective.\\n   \\n      “Russian troops continue to try to encircle Avdiivka, making numerous attempts to storm it,” the Ukrainian National Guard said in an update Wednesday. “Our soldiers are steadfastly holding the line, inflicting significant losses in manpower and equipment on the enemy.”\\n   \\n      On the ground, the fighting constant and fierce.\\n   \\n      “Small arms battles and artillery duels continue around the clock,” Barabash explained. “The assault continues 24/7.”\\n   \\n      And after losing a large chunk of military equipment, including tanks and armoured personnel carriers, in the first few days of the offensive, Russia seems to have shifted to a tactic it knows well, the same it used on Ukrainian forces defending the city of Bakhmut.\\n   \\n      “The enemy is assaulting, throwing more and more flesh,” Barabash explained. “The Russians decided to push on, they keep going despite the losses.”\\n   \\n      But for those who go to Avdiivka day in and day out, that’s where the comparisons end.\\n   \\n      “I don’t think it’s the same as Bakhmut. Avdiivka is a battle-hardened town, it’s been through a lot,” Solviy said. “People there are used to it.”\\n   \\n      While Moscow’s strategy has failed to play out as intended, it has still exacted a toll on Avdiivka. The city’s sole hospital is still functional but unable to provide advanced care.\\n   \\n      “The hospital operates as a stabilization point. Here patients are stabilized and we further transfer them to other cities, where people are provided with more professional help,” Solviy explained, adding there’s not enough staff for the demand. “There is a chief physician Vitalii Sytnik and up to 10 nurses.”\\n   \\n      Aside from the hospital, Avdiivka’s civilian infrastructure is all but gone.\\n   \\n      “There is not a single building left intact,” Barabash said on Wednesday, while Solviy shared a similar view.\\n   \\n      “Everything is destroyed,” the officer said. “Back in the summer, there were hopes that we might come back. There had not yet been heavy destruction.”\\n   \\n      “Now it is an irreversible process. The city is a ruin,” he added.\\n   \\n      But while some people remain, Solviy will continue his daily trips to Avdiivka, hoping to ease the suffering and provide some comfort.\\n   \\n      “I could have been a regular cop, shuffling papers in my office. I chose to be a White Angel,” he said. “It can be scary. Sometimes the fear just takes over, but then it goes away and I keep going.”\\n  ',\n",

       " {'headline': '\\n      Norway’s fastest – and most famous – running family is ripped apart by allegations of ‘aggression and physical punishment’\\n    ',\n",
       "  'contents': ' \\n      In a quiet corner of a Tokyo stadium, a father wipes tears away from his eyes. He has just watched his 20-year-old son win a\\xa0first Olympic gold in thrilling fashion,\\xa0patiently chasing down and passing\\xa0fierce Kenyan rival Timothy Cheruiyot on the final bend of the 1,500-meter\\xa0final.\\n   \\n      The moment would be an emotional one for any parent, but even more so if you have coached your son throughout his running career. Such was the case for Gjert Ingebrigtsen, who\\xa0was the coach to three of his seven children: Henrik, Filip and Jakob, the one who raced to Olympic gold in Tokyo two years ago.\\n   \\n      Today, however, the family dynamic has shifted. The three running brothers ended their coaching relationship with their father last year, prompting a swathe of speculation about a potential rift in Norway’s fastest – and\\xa0most famous\\xa0– sporting family.\\n   \\n      Now the three brothers have spoken publicly about the reasons for no longer being coached by their father, alleging that he is aggressive, controlling and has used physical violence and threats towards them.\\n   \\n      “We still feel discomfort and fear, which lays within us since childhood,” Henrik, Filip, and Jakob wrote in a story for Norwegian newspaper VG, which was published last week.\\n   \\n      “Somehow, we have accepted this. We have lived with it, and in adult age we have moved on. At least we thought so. In retrospect, we realize that it was naive.”\\n   \\n      They said that two years ago, a few months before ending their coaching relationship with their father, “the same aggression and physical punishment struck again. That was the final straw.”\\n   \\n      Gjert Ingebrigtsen has denied these accusations. In comments sent to CNN Sport via his legal representative, Elden Advokatfirma, he said: “The statements that my\\xa0sons\\xa0made are baseless. I have never used violence against my children.\\n   \\n      “That I have had weaknesses as a father, and have been too much of a coach, is a realization I have also come to\\xa0–\\xa0albeit far too late.”\\n   \\n      On Thursday, Norwegian police said that they had carried out “preliminary investigations” into the brothers’\\xa0allegations and have now opened a case under a criminal code relating to “abuse in close relationships.”\\n   \\n      In a statement shared with CNN Sport, inspector Terese Braut Våge said: “This means that we are now in an investigation phase, where the purpose of the investigation is to uncover whether there are criminal circumstances.”\\n   \\n      John Christian Elden, the lawyer representing Gjert, told CNN Sport that his client has not yet been charged with any criminal offense.\\n   \\n      “This was not unexpected, and my client is confident of the outcome of such an investigation,” said Elden, adding that it is Gjert’s “only opportunity to be cleared of any wrongdoing.”\\n   \\n      The brothers’ account of their relationship with their father in VG did not provide details about specific instances of abuse or physical violence.\\xa0And days after the story was published, another Ingebrigtsen brother, Martin, who is not a professional athlete, defended Gjert, telling VG: “Fortunately, fear is an unknown feeling to me. I never feared dad.\\n   \\n      “I must honestly admit that I find it difficult to see this great fear, when others in the family are constantly visiting and have recently been on holiday with Gjert.”\\n   \\n      In an interview with the New York Times last year, Jakob spoke about the tension within the family, saying: “Our father is really anxious and that affects everybody around him. And that quickly evolves to anger towards competitions. Because he’s anxious and he has nerves and he responds by getting irritated and angry about the little stuff.”\\n   \\n      CNN has contacted representatives for the Ingebrigtsen brothers for further comment.\\n   \\n      Henrik, 32, Filip, 30, and Jakob, 23, are all decorated middle and long-distance runners.\\xa0Jakob, however, is the family’s most\\xa0successful\\xa0athlete, winning world and Olympic titles and setting indoor records over 1,500m\\xa0and 2,000m.\\n   \\n      “Jakob is one of the best and biggest athletes in Norway – like [soccer players] Erling Haaland and Martin Ødegaard, or [golfer]\\xa0Viktor Hovland,” Herman Folvik, a sports journalist for VG, told CNN Sport.\\n   \\n      But it’s not for their running prowess alone that the brothers have gained\\xa0celebrity status\\xa0in Norway.\\xa0Team Ingebrigtsen, a documentary series first aired in 2016, has shed light on the family dynamic, particularly the father-coach relationship between Gjert and his sons.\\n   \\n      “I would say that after the royal family, I think they are the most famous family in Norway,” said Folvik. “[The documentary] about the running brothers and Gjert also got really close to the mother [Tone] and the other siblings.”\\n   \\n      The brothers and Gjert announced their split in February 2022, less than a year after Jakob had won gold at the Tokyo Olympics.\\n   \\n      In their story in VG, which was published on October 19,\\xa0Henrik, Filip, and Jakob\\xa0explained how media scrutiny of their relationship with Gjert had compelled them to speak publicly about their family environment.\\n   \\n      “When we broke with Gjert, we thought we would be able to handle the situation in an orderly manner, without mentioning the underlying circumstances,” they said.\\n   \\n      “We now realize that is not possible. This matter has become so inflamed, and has had such great consequences, that we feel a responsibility to clean it up.”\\n   \\n      They described the situation as a “family conflict” and said that they now hope to achieve “peace for all parties.”\\n   \\n      In his comments to CNN Sport, Gjert lamented the “tragic situation” for the Ingebrigtsens.\\n   \\n      “Our family has lived in the public spotlight for many years, and we have chosen to let the public into our lives through TV series, interviews and much more,” he said.\\n   \\n      “That violence should have occurred in this public family life is unthinkable. The Norwegian people have seen our lives, for better or for worse … I don’t know how we’re going to get past this – but we have to try.”\\n   \\n      The situation between the father and his three sons is complicated by the fact that Gjert is currently coaching another Norwegian athlete, Narve Gilje Nordås, who won a bronze medal in the 1,500 meters at this year’s world championships – finishing fractionally behind Jakob.\\n   \\n      The Norwegian Athletics Federation has recently said that Gjert would not be granted accreditation as a coach for international competitions – next year’s world indoor championships and European championships.\\n   \\n      In two separate statements, the federation said that it wants to create a “safe environment” for athletes and made reference to comments made by the Ingebrigtsen brothers in the media.\\xa0It also said that it would recommend that Gjert would not receive accreditation for next year’s Paris Olympics.\\n   \\n      Nordås, meanwhile, has said that he plans to make a statement in the coming days. He has called the situation absurd and said he continues to train with Gjert.\\n   \\n      As for Jakob, he is essentially self-coached but continues to lean on his older brothers for advice. Still arguably the most dominant middle-distance runner in the world, he holds lofty ambitions for his track and field career.\\n   \\n      “I don’t want to sound immodest,” he said in an interview earlier this year, “but my main goal is to become the best runner of all time, for which I still have a lot of work to do.”\\n  ',\n",

       " {'headline': '\\n      Taylor Swift is now a billionaire, Bloomberg says\\n    ',\n",
       "  'contents': ' \\n      Taylor Swift has another accolade to add to her lengthy resume this year: America’s favorite pop star is now a billionaire, according to a Bloomberg analysis.\\n   \\n      The outlet, which runs the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, said Swift’s total net worth is now at $1.1 billion, thanks to a record-breaking Eras tour that helped boost the US economy this summer.\\n   \\n      Bloomberg said Swift is one of the few entertainers to reach that status based on just her music and performance.\\n   \\n      Chris Leyden, director of growth marketing at SeatGeek, previously told CNN that “Taylor Swift’s ‘Eras’ tour is rewriting the playbook of entertainment economics.”\\n   \\n      “She’s not just a performer — she’s an economic phenomenon,” Leyden said.\\n   \\n      Swift has dominated not only Super Bowl-sized arenas, but local movie theaters as well. In its opening weekend, the pop singer’s concert film, “Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour,” raked in about $96 million in the box office in the United States and Canada, making it the highest-groatssing concert film domestically for an opening weekend, according to AMC.\\n   \\n      The Eras tour could gross $2.2 billion in North American ticket sales alone, according to August\\xa0survey data from research firm QuestionPro provided to CNN exclusively. That unprecedented total represents primary ticket sales for the US shows that Swift just concluded in Los Angeles, plus a second North American leg coming next year. That would make it the highest-grossing tour ever.\\n   \\n      It brought a boost to the economy in its many stops through North American cities – the final six nights of Taylor Swift’s Eras tour in Los Angeles were estimated to bring\\xa0$320 million to the city, according to the California Center for Jobs and the Economy.\\n   \\n      She’s even putting the NFL on the map – at least for those who already weren’t tuning in to Sunday Night Football. News that the star was\\xa0rumored\\xa0to be attending an Oct. 1 game to see Kansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce has sent ticket prices soaring more than 40% — from $83 to $119 – according to TickPick, an online marketplace.\\n   \\n      The singer became a cultural phenomenon, adding to her economic influence. In cities where Swift performed,\\xa0ridership on public transit spiked\\xa0and\\xa0hotel occupancy skyrocketed. Santa Clara, the tech-rich city located in Northern California,\\xa0briefly became\\xa0“Swiftie Clara.” In Seattle, dancing Swifties caused seismic activity that\\xa0one seismologist said was equal to a 2.3 magnitude earthquake.\\n   \\n      The star is adding another album rerelease on Friday – “1989 (Taylor’s Version),” which earned a total of 10 Grammy nominations at the time it was released.\\n   \\n      Swift\\xa0announced\\xa0in 2019 that she planned to re-record her first six studio albums after her former label sold her master recordings. She has since released “Taylor’s Version” albums for “Red,” “Speak Now” and “Fearless.”\\n   \\n      Swift can now join the ranks of Rihanna, who became a billionaire in 2021, according to Forbes. Though it’s been years since Rihanna dropped an album, she spent that time building her business empire through her\\xa0Fenty Beauty\\xa0makeup line and her\\xa0Savage x Fenty\\xa0lingerie line. Jay Z and Beyoncé reached the milestone in 2017. Besides music, the pair had their hands in a variety of business ventures.\\n   \\n– CNN’s Krystal Hur, Bryan Mena and Danielle Wiener-Bronner contributed to this report.\\n',\n",

       "  'contents': ' \\n      As communities in Maine grieve 18 people killed in a shooting at a bowling alley and restaurant two days ago, officials still are imploring thousands of residents to shelter in place Friday while a massive search for a suspect continues.\\n   \\n      Authorities consider the suspect, Robert Card, armed and dangerous, and schools, businesses and other facilities have closed over safety concerns while hundreds of law enforcement officers swarm parts of southern Maine in Card’s pursuit.\\n   \\n      The horror began around 7 p.m. Wednesday in the city of Lewiston, where authorities say Card opened fire at Just-in-Time Recreation and then later at Schemengees Bar & Grille. In addition to the 18 people killed, 13 others were injured, Maine Gov. Janet Mills said Thursday.\\n   \\n      The shooting and subsequent manhunt spurred shelter-in-place orders for Androscoggin and northern Sagadahoc counties, which encompass Lewiston and the nearby Auburn and Lisbon communities.\\n   \\n      “Nerves are rattled right now – (I’m) keeping an eye on the woods,” said Cory, a Lisbon resident whose 10-year-old daughter was inside his home. “Seeing the cops coming around here, that makes me feel a million times better.”\\n   \\n      Wednesday night’s massacre appears to be the deadliest mass shooting in the United States this year. It is also the worst since a\\xa0gunman killed 19 students and two teachers at a school in Uvalde, Texas, last year. Overall, at least 566 mass shootings have happened this year across the country, with four or more shot excluding the shooter, according to the\\xa0Gun Violence Archive.\\n   \\n      Card, 40, faces an arrest warrant in eight counts of murder, police said. Authorities on Thursday at least twice converged on Card’s last known address, a home in Bowdoin, Maine, roughly 15 miles east of Lewiston.\\n   \\n      Thursday evening, investigators believed they detected something inside or near the home, spurring a flurry of activity, a law enforcement official said. A CNN crew there heard an officer say “come out with your hands up.” But that episode appeared to end uneventfully, with authorities leaving the scene two hours later and Maine State Police saying they were done there for the night.\\n   \\n      Earlier Thursday, investigators executed a search warrant at the residence, looking for computers, notes, weapons and any evidence that might indicate a plan for the shootings, law enforcement sources told CNN.\\n   \\n      In the suspect’s car – found abandoned some 8 miles from Lewiston in Lisbon, authorities said – investigators found a gun, a law enforcement official told CNN on Thursday. It has not been determined if the firearm was used in the shooting, the source said.\\n   \\n      Authorities are expected to return to Bowdoin to continue investigating Friday, Maine Department of Public Safety spokesperson Shannon Moss said.\\n   \\n      The search for Card could be complicated by his background in combat training. Card is a certified firearms instructor and a member of the US Army Reserve, law enforcement officials in Maine told CNN.\\n   \\n      Katherine Schweit, a former FBI senior official, said Thursday night that Card has an advantage.\\n   \\n      “He’s in his own backyard, and we’re coming into his own backyard to try to find him in a game of hide and seek. He knows what he’s looking for and where he’s going to go,” Schweit told CNN’s Kaitlan Collins on Thursday. “He has a plan, and law enforcement has to follow those trails wherever they can find them until he makes a decision to stop. So, if he keeps going, that’s just what we’re facing.”\\n   \\n      The names of some victims who were killed Wednesday night have been released.\\n   \\n      Tricia Asselin was a part time employee at the bowling alley, but she was there Wednesday night bowling recreationally when the shots rang out, according to her brother DJ Johnson.\\n   \\n      “What I’m told is that when it all started happening, she ran up to the counter and started to call 911, and that’s when she was shot,” Johnson told CNN on Thursday. “That was just her. She wasn’t going to run. She was going to try and help.”\\n   \\n      Asselin, 53, had a son who meant the world to her, Johnson said.\\n   \\n      “Her son was her entire life. From the day he was born to yesterday. She did everything for him … he was her world,” Johnson said.\\n   \\n      Asselin’s sister, Bobbi Nichols, also was at the bowling alley when the shooting happened, but she was able to flee the rampage, Johnson said. Tommy Conrad, a manager at the bowling alley, was killed Wednesday, his family confirmed to CNN affiliate WMTW. Conrad, 34, left behind a 9-year-old daughter.\\n   \\n      Bryan MacFarlane was playing in a cornhole tournament at the restaurant when he was killed Wednesday, his sister Keri Brooks told CNN.\\xa0\\xa0MacFarlan, part of the local deaf community, typically went to Schemengees on Wednesdays, when other deaf people gather to play the game, Brooks said. He leaves behind his mother and his sister.\\n   \\n      “I grew up in Maine and the deaf community is a tight-knit community,” Brooks said. “Not only was my brother slain, but my friends were too,” she said of the other victims she has learned about.\\n   \\n      MacFarlane, 40, was one of the first deaf people in Vermont to get his commercial trucking driver’s license, Brooks said.\\n   \\n      Peyton Brewer-Ross also was at that cornhole tournament when he was fatally shot, according to his brother Ralph Brewer. He enjoyed playing the game and spending time with friends at the restaurant.\\n   \\n      Brewer-Ross was a father of two children and “loved being a dad more than anything else,” his brother said, adding he had just celebrated his daughter’s second birthday a couple of weeks ago.\\n   \\n      “She woke up telling her mom, Rachel (Sloat), ‘Where’s daddy, where’s daddy?’” Brewer said. “At 2 years old, she isn’t going to remember any of this, but in the same breath, she isn’t going to have her dad be there the rest of her life.”\\n   \\n      The first 911 calls reporting a shooting came at 6:56 p.m. Wednesday from the bowling alley. Then about 12 minutes later, multiple 911 calls reported a shooting at the restaurant, roughly 4 miles away.\\n   \\n      As police arrived on scene, people were fleeing the bowling alley, video obtained by CNN shows. Another video showed a person on a stretcher taken to an ambulance.\\n   \\n      Nichols told CNN she and her sister were bowling in separate lanes when she heard a “bang” but didn’t know what was happening until she heard a second shot. Then she lost sight of her sister when everyone began frantically running away.\\n   \\n      “I couldn’t see her, and everybody was running. I got caught in people trampling and running out,” Nichols told CNN’s Jake Tapper on Thursday.\\n   \\n      Nichols said she ran as far as she could before finally reaching a fence and some trees, behind which she and others hid as they wondered what was going on. Two hours later, she later learned Asselin was killed trying to call 911.\\n   \\n      “When she called 911 to save everybody, she lost her life because of it. She was a great person,” Nichols said. “She was a hero.”\\n   \\n      Card is a petroleum supply specialist in the Army Reserve and first enlisted in 2002, according to records provided by the Army on Thursday.\\xa0\\n \\n      And while Card is a certified firearms instructor, law enforcement officials told CNN, his time in the Army did not include training as a firearms instructor “nor did he serve in that capacity for the Army,” spokesperson Bryce Dubee said in a statement to CNN.\\n   \\n      Still, Card had extensive training, including land navigation, making him “very comfortable in the woods,” said Clifford Steeves, who told CNN he knew Card when they both served in the Army Reserve.\\n   \\n      Steeves met Card in the early 2000s when they served together and knew him until about a decade ago, he said. Steeves didn’t witness any concerning behavior from Card, whom he described as an “outdoors type of guy.” He said Card is a skilled marksman who was one of the best shooters in his unit.\\n   \\n      “He was a very nice guy – very quiet. He never overused his authority or was mean or rude to other soldiers,” Steeves said. “It’s really upsetting.”\\n   \\n      Over the summer, Card was at the Camp Smith training facility in upstate New York, when he started making statements about hearing voices and having thoughts about wanting to hurt fellow soldiers, law enforcement sources told CNN’s John Miller. He received a command referral to a military hospital and spent a few weeks under evaluation, the sources said.\\n   \\n      Katie O’Neill, Card’s sister-in-law, told CNN he didn’t have a long history with mental health challenges.\\n   \\n      “This is something that was an acute episode. This is not who he is,” O’Neill said. “He is not someone who has had mental health issues for his lifetime or anything like that.”\\n   \\nCNN’s Shimon Prokupecz, John Miller, Travis Nichols, Amanda Jackson, David Williams, Caroll Alvarado, Eric Levenson, Maria Santana,\\xa0Haley Brtizky, Joe Sutton, Sara Smart, Brian Todd, Evan Perez, Macie Goldfarb, Maria\\xa0Sole\\xa0Campinoti, Andy Rose, Josh Campbell and Chris Boyette contributed to this report.\\n',\n",

Janet Mills said Thursday.\\n   \\n      The shooting and subsequent manhunt spurred shelter-in-place orders for Androscoggin and northern Sagadahoc counties, which encompass Lewiston and the nearby Auburn and Lisbon communities.\\n   \\n      “Nerves are rattled right now – (I’m) keeping an eye on the woods,” said Cory, a Lisbon resident whose 10-year-old daughter was inside his home. “Seeing the cops coming around here, that makes me feel a million times better.”\\n   \\n      Wednesday night’s massacre appears to be the deadliest mass shooting in the United States this year. It is also the worst since a\\xa0gunman killed 19 students and two teachers at a school in Uvalde, Texas, last year. Overall, at least 566 mass shootings have happened this year across the country, with four or more shot excluding the shooter, according to the\\xa0Gun Violence Archive.\\n   \\n      Card, 40, faces an arrest warrant in eight counts of murder, police said. Authorities on Thursday at least twice converged on Card’s last known address, a home in Bowdoin, Maine, roughly 15 miles east of Lewiston.\\n   \\n      Thursday evening, investigators believed they detected something inside or near the home, spurring a flurry of activity, a law enforcement official said. A CNN crew there heard an officer say “come out with your hands up.” But that episode appeared to end uneventfully, with authorities leaving the scene two hours later and Maine State Police saying they were done there for the night.\\n   \\n      Earlier Thursday, investigators executed a search warrant at the residence, looking for computers, notes, weapons and any evidence that might indicate a plan for the shootings, law enforcement sources told CNN.\\n   \\n      In the suspect’s car – found abandoned some 8 miles from Lewiston in Lisbon, authorities said – investigators found a gun, a law enforcement official told CNN on Thursday. It has not been determined if the firearm was used in the shooting, the source said.\\n   \\n      Authorities are expected to return to Bowdoin to continue investigating Friday, Maine Department of Public Safety spokesperson Shannon Moss said.\\n   \\n      The search for Card could be complicated by his background in combat training. Card is a certified firearms instructor and a member of the US Army Reserve, law enforcement officials in Maine told CNN.\\n   \\n      Katherine Schweit, a former FBI senior official, said Thursday night that Card has an advantage.\\n   \\n      “He’s in his own backyard, and we’re coming into his own backyard to try to find him in a game of hide and seek. He knows what he’s looking for and where he’s going to go,” Schweit told CNN’s Kaitlan Collins on Thursday. “He has a plan, and law enforcement has to follow those trails wherever they can find them until he makes a decision to stop. So, if he keeps going, that’s just what we’re facing.”\\n   \\n      The names of some victims who were killed Wednesday night have been released.\\n   \\n      Tricia Asselin was a part time employee at the bowling alley, but she was there Wednesday night bowling recreationally when the shots rang out, according to her brother DJ Johnson.\\n   \\n      “What I’m told is that when it all started happening, she ran up to the counter and started to call 911, and that’s when she was shot,” Johnson told CNN on Thursday. “That was just her. She wasn’t going to run. She was going to try and help.”\\n   \\n      Asselin, 53, had a son who meant the world to her, Johnson said.\\n   \\n      “Her son was her entire life. From the day he was born to yesterday. She did everything for him … he was her world,” Johnson said.\\n   \\n      Asselin’s sister, Bobbi Nichols, also was at the bowling alley when the shooting happened, but she was able to flee the rampage, Johnson said. Tommy Conrad, a manager at the bowling alley, was killed Wednesday, his family confirmed to CNN affiliate WMTW. Conrad, 34, left behind a 9-year-old daughter.\\n   \\n      Bryan MacFarlane was playing in a cornhole tournament at the restaurant when he was killed Wednesday, his sister Keri Brooks told CNN.\\xa0\\xa0MacFarlan, part of the local deaf community, typically went to Schemengees on Wednesdays, when other deaf people gather to play the game, Brooks said. He leaves behind his mother and his sister.\\n   \\n      “I grew up in Maine and the deaf community is a tight-knit community,” Brooks said. “Not only was my brother slain, but my friends were too,” she said of the other victims she has learned about.\\n   \\n      MacFarlane, 40, was one of the first deaf people in Vermont to get his commercial trucking driver’s license, Brooks said.\\n   \\n      Peyton Brewer-Ross also was at that cornhole tournament when he was fatally shot, according to his brother Ralph Brewer. He enjoyed playing the game and spending time with friends at the restaurant.\\n   \\n      Brewer-Ross was a father of two children and “loved being a dad more than anything else,” his brother said, adding he had just celebrated his daughter’s second birthday a couple of weeks ago.\\n   \\n      “She woke up telling her mom, Rachel (Sloat), ‘Where’s daddy, where’s daddy?’” Brewer said. “At 2 years old, she isn’t going to remember any of this, but in the same breath, she isn’t going to have her dad be there the rest of her life.”\\n   \\n      The first 911 calls reporting a shooting came at 6:56 p.m. Wednesday from the bowling alley. Then about 12 minutes later, multiple 911 calls reported a shooting at the restaurant, roughly 4 miles away.\\n   \\n      As police arrived on scene, people were fleeing the bowling alley, video obtained by CNN shows. Another video showed a person on a stretcher taken to an ambulance.\\n   \\n      Nichols told CNN she and her sister were bowling in separate lanes when she heard a “bang” but didn’t know what was happening until she heard a second shot. Then she lost sight of her sister when everyone began frantically running away.\\n   \\n      “I couldn’t see her, and everybody was running. I got caught in people trampling and running out,” Nichols told CNN’s Jake Tapper on Thursday.\\n   \\n      Nichols said she ran as far as she could before finally reaching a fence and some trees, behind which she and others hid as they wondered what was going on. Two hours later, she later learned Asselin was killed trying to call 911.\\n   \\n      “When she called 911 to save everybody, she lost her life because of it. She was a great person,” Nichols said. “She was a hero.”\\n   \\n      Card is a petroleum supply specialist in the Army Reserve and first enlisted in 2002, according to records provided by the Army on Thursday.\\xa0\\n \\n      And while Card is a certified firearms instructor, law enforcement officials told CNN, his time in the Army did not include training as a firearms instructor “nor did he serve in that capacity for the Army,” spokesperson Bryce Dubee said in a statement to CNN.\\n   \\n      Still, Card had extensive training, including land navigation, making him “very comfortable in the woods,” said Clifford Steeves, who told CNN he knew Card when they both served in the Army Reserve.\\n   \\n      Steeves met Card in the early 2000s when they served together and knew him until about a decade ago, he said. Steeves didn’t witness any concerning behavior from Card, whom he described as an “outdoors type of guy.” He said Card is a skilled marksman who was one of the best shooters in his unit.\\n   \\n      “He was a very nice guy – very quiet. He never overused his authority or was mean or rude to other soldiers,” Steeves said. “It’s really upsetting.”\\n   \\n      Over the summer, Card was at the Camp Smith training facility in upstate New York, when he started making statements about hearing voices and having thoughts about wanting to hurt fellow soldiers, law enforcement sources told CNN’s John Miller. He received a command referral to a military hospital and spent a few weeks under evaluation, the sources said.\\n   \\n      Katie O’Neill, Card’s sister-in-law, told CNN he didn’t have a long history with mental health challenges.\\n   \\n      “This is something that was an acute episode. This is not who he is,” O’Neill said. “He is not someone who has had mental health issues for his lifetime or anything like that.”\\n   \\nCNN’s Shimon Prokupecz, John Miller, Travis Nichols, Amanda Jackson, David Williams, Caroll Alvarado, Eric Levenson, Maria Santana,\\xa0Haley Brtizky, Joe Sutton, Sara Smart, Brian Todd, Evan Perez, Macie Goldfarb, Maria\\xa0Sole\\xa0Campinoti, Andy Rose, Josh Campbell and Chris Boyette contributed to this report.\\n',\n",

       "  'contents': ' \\n      European Union leaders have stopped short of calling for a ceasefire in Gaza, instead appealing\\xa0for humanitarian “pauses” to provide aid, as the UN warned its operations were being “paralyzed” by Israel’s bombardment of the besieged enclave.\\n   \\n      The communique, released after meetings Thursday in Brussels, follows several failed attempts by the UN Security Council to pass a resolution on the Israel-Hamas war, with member states preparing to vote on another draft resolution – this time put forward by Jordan on behalf of Arab states – on Friday.\\n   \\n      Jordan’s Foreign Minister\\xa0Ayman Safadi told diplomats gathered at the United Nations Assembly Hall that “collective punishment is not self-defense.” The resolution calls for a “cessation of hostilities,” the release of hostages, and the rejection of “any attempts at forced transfer of the Palestinian civilian population.”\\n   \\n      More than 2 million people trapped in Gaza are living through a deepening humanitarian crisis, hastened by daily airstrikes and an Israeli blockade of life-saving fuel. Israel says Hamas is stockpiling fuel for its own use and has called on the militant Palestinian group that governs Gaza to share it. Health services have been crippled by power shortages and hundreds of thousands of civilians have been forced to flee their homes amid the bombing.\\n   \\n      Israeli strikes have killed more than 7,028 people in Gaza, including thousands of children, since October 7, according to figures released Thursday by the Hamas-controlled Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza.\\n   \\n      Pressure is building on the international community to persuade Israel to allow\\xa0desperately needed aid\\xa0into Gaza; the United Nations and several countries in the region have called for an immediate ceasefire, while others advocate for a “humanitarian pause” in fighting.\\n   \\n      But the world has so far failed to unite around a common position on the crisis, nearly three weeks since the outbreak of violence, sparked by Hamas’ brutal October 7 terror attacks and kidnapping rampage that killed over 1,400 people in Israel and saw over 200 people taken to Gaza as hostages.\\n   \\n      Israeli ambassador to the UN Gilad Erdan on Thursday said requests for a ceasefire were “not an attempt for peace,” but “an attempt to tie Israel’s hands, preventing us from eliminating a huge threat to our citizens.”\\n   \\n      “Israel is not at war with human beings, we are at war with monsters,” he added, saying, “our goal is to completely eradicate Hamas’s capability and we will use every means at our disposal to accomplish this.”\\n   \\n      His comments came as Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said Israel’s forces are preparing for the “next\\xa0stages” in its war against Hamas, which is widely expected to come in the form of a ground incursion.\\n   \\n      “The maneuvering will begin when the conditions are right. These conditions are complex because so is the campaign. The troops are ready,” Gallant said in a briefing in Tel Aviv.\\n   \\n      For a second night, Israel’s military conducted “targeted raids” in northern Gaza overnight on Friday after vowing to continue ground raids over the coming days.\\n   \\n      The raids included aircraft and artillery strikes in the area of Shaja’iyah, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said. Video published by the IDF showed tanks and armored vehicles moving on a road near agricultural land as well as strikes on buildings and open areas.\\n   \\n      The incursions are intended to kill Hamas militants, lay the foundations for an all-out invasion and neutralize explosive devices and reconnaissance posts, IDF spokesperson Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said on Thursday.\\n   \\n      Meanwhile, six people were injured when a rocket struck the Red Sea resort city of Taba, in Egypt, early on Friday, according to official sources cited by Egypt-affiliated Al-Qahera News.\\n   \\n      The rocket hit an ambulance building and a residential area of the hospital’s administration in the city, which shares its border with Israel. It is unclear yet who fired the rocket.\\n   \\n      IDF spokesperson Daniel Hagari said at a press briefing Friday that Israel will cooperate with Egypt and the US to “tighten the defense in the region against threats from the Red Sea area.” Hagari said an aerial “threat” had been detected in the Red Sea area, which he said he believed was the cause of the strike in Egypt.\\n   \\n      The\\xa0health ministry\\xa0in\\xa0Hamas-controlled Gaza on Thursday published a 212-page report listing thousands of names described as\\xa0“documented deaths since October 7” in Gaza which it blamed on Israeli military “aggression.”\\n   \\n      The ministry said the death toll is likely to be much higher and said its report excludes casualties who have not been identified, those buried without being brought to hospital for registration, or those still missing – who number around 1,600.\\n   \\n      The list, which does not distinguish between combatants and non-combatants but which does list age, sex and the victim’s ID card number, followed US\\xa0President Joe Biden’s comments that he had “no confidence” in the figures of civilian casualties reported by the Gaza Health Ministry.\\n   \\n      Israel, along with the US, has expressed doubts about the casualty numbers being reported out of Gaza, but has not provided evidence that they are exaggerated.\\n   \\n      White House spokesman John Kirby called the Gaza-based ministry “a front for\\xa0Hamas,”\\xa0though when asked he did not dispute that thousands of Palestinians, many innocent civilians, had been killed.\\n   \\n      The prime minister of the US-backed Palestinian Authority in the West Bank, Mohammad Shtayyeh, said the PA’s own health authority considers the numbers to be “correct.”\\n   \\n      “They are our numbers,” Shtayyeh said in an interview Thursday with Al Jazeera. “These numbers are fed to us from the hospitals of Gaza every single day (and) are received by our Ministry of Health.”\\n   \\n      The Ramallah-based Palestinian Authority is run by a rival faction to\\xa0Hamas,\\xa0and\\xa0operates the umbrella Ministry of Health which maintains a relationship with the ministry in Gaza. Death tolls for Gaza are released both in Gaza and Ramallah daily.\\n   \\n      CNN is not able to independently verify the death toll tabulated in Gaza.\\n   \\n      Israel has also accused Hamas of controlling life-saving fuel supplies in Gaza, as basic services such as hospitals, bakeries and UN humanitarian operations are on the verge of shutting down due to a lack of fuel.\\n   \\n      Juliette Touma, the communications director for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), said the agency will be forced to halt operations altogether if it does not get enough fuel – crucial for generating power for hospitals and desalinating water.\\n   \\n      “UNRWA continues to struggle with very limited and dwindling fuel supplies,” Touma said.\\xa0“Rationing of deliveries continues, including to medical facilities and bakeries. UNRWA is being paralyzed due to the lack of fuel deliveries into the Gaza Strip.”\\n   \\n      The IDF said that the problem is not a lack of fuel in Gaza, but that it is in the hands of Hamas.\\n   \\n      IDF spokesperson Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus told CNN on Thursday that Hamas controls “between 800,000 and perhaps more than one million liters of fuel of different types stored inside Gaza,” according to Israeli military intelligence estimates.\\n   \\n      “Some of it was stockpiled before, some of it stolen from the UN, some of it’s stolen by Hamas from private vendors,” he said.\\n   \\n      CNN cannot independently verify the amount of fuel in Gaza.\\n   \\n      Israel continues to block deliveries of fuel altogether to Gaza, saying that Hamas would only divert it for military use.\\n   \\n      Speaking to CNN on Thursday, another UNRWA spokesperson, Tamara Alrifai, said, “Whether or not other sources of fuel exist in Gaza is of no direct relevance to us, we are a human agency and we should not be begging for fuel to nourish our own operations.”\\n   \\n      With fuel rapidly running out, UNWRA is being forced to make difficult decisions over\\xa0diverting power between bakeries and hospital wards with more than 600,000 people now displaced and relying on a single piece of bread each day, Alrifai added.\\n   \\n      Twelve aid trucks carrying water, food, medicine and medical supplies – but no fuel – entered Gaza from the Rafah border crossing with Egypt on Thursday, according to the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS).\\n   \\n      A total of 74\\xa0trucks have entered the strip since humanitarian\\xa0aid\\xa0transfers resumed several days ago, PRCS said.\\n   \\n      In normal times, the figure would be about 455 per day, the United Nations has said, meaning basic supplies are trickling into the enclave at a much slower pace than needed.\\n   \\n      The head of UNRWA warned the current aid provisions to Gaza were just for “show” and “nothing more than crumbs,” as he warned that hunger and disease were becoming major issues in the besieged enclave.\\n   \\n      “Over the last week, I followed closely the focus about the number of trucks entering\\xa0Gaza.\\xa0Many of us saw\\xa0in\\xa0these trucks a glimmer of hope. This is, however,\\xa0becoming\\xa0a distraction,” Philippe Lazzarini said at a press conference\\xa0in\\xa0Jerusalem on Friday.\\n   \\n      “We should avoid conveying the message that few trucks a day means the siege is lifted for humanitarian\\xa0aid. This is not true,” Lazzarini added. “The\\xa0current\\xa0system\\xa0in\\xa0place is geared to fail. What is needed is meaningful and non-interrupted\\xa0aid\\xa0flow.”\\n   \\n      Overcrowded hospitals on the brink of collapse say they are overwhelmed with the numbers of injured people and doctors have repeatedly told CNN they don’t have the supplies or the electricity to run critical functions to properly care for them.\\n   \\nThis story is developing and is being updated.\\n  ',\n",

       "  'contents': ' \\n      The US carried out airstrikes targeting\\xa0two\\xa0facilities linked to Iranian-backed militias in eastern Syria\\xa0on Thursday, according to a statement from Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, following a series of drone and rocket attacks against US forces in the region.\\n   \\n      The statement said the facilities have been used by Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and affiliated groups.\\n   \\n      The strikes, carried out by a pair of F-16 fighter jets using\\xa0precision-guided\\xa0munitions, targeted a weapons and ammunition storage facility in Abu Kamal near the border between Syria and Iraq.\\n   \\n      Austin described the strikes, which were ordered by President Joe Biden, as “narrowly tailored in self-defense” and emphasized they are separate from the ongoing conflict in Gaza.\\xa0He directly accused Iran\\xa0of\\xa0having a role in the attacks on US forces, saying in the statement, “Iran wants to hide its hand and deny its role in these attacks against our forces. We will not let them.” Austin also promised further strikes if the attacks by Iran’s proxies continue.\\n   \\n      The two facilities targeted by US airstrikes in eastern Syria had been previously occupied by members of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and affiliated militia groups, a senior military official said, but it’s still unclear if the strikes resulted in any casualties.\\n   \\n      “We know that there were people on the target at various points during the day,” said the official during a briefing with reporters following the attack. “Again, we know that they were not civilians,” the official added.\\xa0“The people that occupy these locations are Iranian-aligned militia groups as well as\\xa0IRGC personnel.”\\n   \\n      But\\xa0it would take more time to establish\\xa0a more precise figure on how many were killed in the strike, if any, the official said.\\n   \\n      A senior defense official called Iran “the center of gravity” for the attacks on US forces in the region, saying that “Iranian fingerprints are all over this.”\\n   \\n      “Tehran and Iranian senior leaders are funding,\\xa0arming, equipping, training and directing a whole plethora of militia groups across the region, and they have escalated attacks against US forces since October 17, which is why we took self-defense action tonight,” the official said.\\n   \\n      The\\xa0Biden administration\\xa0has carried out strikes against militias before, but at a time of enormous tension, the US is\\xa0looking to send a strong message to Iran and the militias not to escalate their attacks and spark a wider conflict in the Middle East. The region is on edge as the\\xa0Israel-Hamas\\xa0war, which was triggered\\xa0by Hamas’ brutal terror attack on October 7, continues.\\n   \\n      Earlier\\xa0Thursday,\\xa0the US announced it is deploying about 900 troops to the Middle East - with the potential for many more. The US has also moved two carrier strike groups to the eastern Mediterranean Sea and an amphibious ready group closer to Israel in the waters of the Middle East.\\n   \\n      The US strikes follow a growing number of attacks against US forces in Iraq and Syria since October\\xa017.\\xa0As of Thursday evening, US forces had come under attack a total of 19 times, according to the Pentagon,\\xa0at least 12 separate times in Iraq and\\xa0four\\xa0separate times in Syria,\\xa0resulting in\\xa021 US service members suffering injuries. The Pentagon said the injuries were all minor and that the troops have returned to duty. One US civilian contractor suffered a fatal heart attack as a result of a false alarm at one of the bases in Iraq.\\n   \\n      On Wednesday, Biden issued a\\xa0strong warning\\xa0to Iran about its proxies attacking US forces in the region. “My warning to the ayatollah was that if they continued to move against those troops, we will respond, and they should be prepared.” Biden also said the presence of US troops in Iraq and Syria is focused on the campaign to defeat ISIS and is not related to the ongoing conflict in Israel.\\n   \\n      But Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian did not attempt to\\xa0tamp down\\xa0the tensions Thursday at an emergency session of the UN General Assembly, stating that the US “will not be spared from this fire” if the war in Gaza doesn’t end. Earlier this week, the minister had said that Iran had received two messages from the US, though he would not say how or when the messages were delivered. The first message said the US was not interested in a wider expansion of the conflict, he said, while the second urged Iran and its partners to have self-restraint.\\n   \\n      The last known US strike against Iranian-backed militias in the region occurred in March, when the military struck a facility it\\xa0said was used\\xa0by\\xa0groups affiliated with Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. It followed a similar series of drone and rocket attacks against US facilities in the region.\\n   \\n      Pentagon press secretary Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder said Thursday\\xa0that the US “will always\\xa0reserve the right to self-defense” and that if the US chooses to retaliate for the drone and rocket attacks, it would be “at a time and place of our choosing.”\\n   \\n      In the face of an increased threat of attack, the Defense Department is rushing additional air defenses to the Middle East. Those systems include a THAAD battery, which is a medium-range air defense system, long-range Patriot batteries, and short-range Avenger air defense systems. The Pentagon declined to say exactly when they would arrive or where they\\xa0would\\xa0be stationed.\\n   \\n      The US is also providing two Iron Dome air defense systems to Israel for its own needs.\\n   \\nThis story has been updated with additional details.\\n',\n",

       "  'contents': ' \\n      Souad Al-Alem was one of the roughly 10,000 people forced to flee the Palestinian town of al-Majdal. It was 1948, she was a young woman\\xa0and Israel’s\\xa0troops were approaching the community\\xa0during the Arab-Israeli war\\xa0in what is now part of the Israeli city of Ashkelon.\\n   \\n      Now in her 90s and living in Gaza, Al-Alem has been forced to run again.\\n   \\n      On October 7, Hamas launched a deadly terror attack against Israel from Gaza, firing thousands of rockets,\\xa0going on a bloody rampage that killed 1,400 people\\xa0and taking more than 220 hostage.\\xa0In retaliation, the Israel Defence Forces have been conducting a massive bombardment campaign against\\xa0what it says are Hamas targets in\\xa0Gaza.\\xa0More than\\xa06,850\\xa0Palestinians have been killed as a result of these strikes, according to information from Hamas-controlled health authorities in Gaza and published by the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Ramallah.\\n   \\n      Al-Alem is one of the hundreds of thousands of civilians caught up in the war.\\n   \\n      “I see death 20 times every day, in the sky and on earth. Even the force of every blast affects us psychologically. It feels like it is on top of our heads when it’s next to us or nearby,” Al-Alem told CNN.\\n   \\n      Just 10 miles north of the Gaza border, not much remains of al-Majdal. Once a buzzing market place known for textile manufacturing, al-Majdal was reduced to rubble after the 1948/49\\xa0war.\\n   \\n      All of its houses are long gone, replaced with modern Israeli buildings that are now part of Ashkelon. Only the old mosque remains standing. Nearby, an empty, overgrown field gives a hint of the size of the former town.\\n   \\n      Some 700,000 Palestinians were expelled or\\xa0fled\\xa0their homes following the 1948/49\\xa0war, representing at least 80 percent of Arabs living in what became Israel. Like Al-Alem,\\xa0more than half\\xa0of those who live in Gaza today are either refugees or their direct descendants.\\n   \\n      Many of those\\xa0displaced\\xa0in 1948 thought that they’d be back home in a few days or weeks. But Israel has never allowed them to return and many have lived in poverty ever since.\\xa0According to\\xa0the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA),\\xa0more than 80% of people in Gaza live in poverty now.\\n   \\n      Palestinians call that episode the Nakba, the Arabic word for\\xa0catastrophe.\\n   \\n      “I lived the Nakba of 1948 and now I am living the Nakba of 2023,” Al-Alem said, sitting in a tent in a makeshift refugee camp\\xa0in Khan Younis in southern Gaza. “This second one is worse,” she added.\\xa0She said she fled her home amid intense bombing more than 10 days ago and said she hasn’t had a proper meal or bath since then. As a diabetic, she said she was struggling without regular meals and access to her usual medication.\\n   \\n      “There nothing to use for cleaning our faces and hands and ourselves. We can’t wash or do anything. There is nothing. \\xa0There were toilets, now there aren’t any. When we go to toilets, they are dirty because too many people are using them. I stopped going to them,” she said.\\n   \\n      While most of the former\\xa0Arab\\xa0villages and towns are long gone, the collective memory lives on.\\n   \\n      “It’s amazing how the Palestinians keep those memories alive. Most of them in the traditional way, from stories told by their fathers and grandfathers,” said Umar al-Ghubari, a Palestinian educator who works for Zochrot.\\n   \\n      A Tel Aviv-based NGO, Zochrot was originally formed by a group of Israeli Jews with a goal to “promote acknowledgement, responsibility and accountability” for the\\xa0\\ufeffemptied\\xa0Palestinian\\xa0villages\\xa0and campaign for the\\xa0right of\\xa0return of these communities.\\n   \\n      The first step is to spread awareness, al-Ghubari said. Zochrot operates in Hebrew, publishing information materials, organizing tours and collecting testimonies.\\n   \\n      Al-Ghubari\\xa0acknowledges that\\xa0Zochrot’s work\\xa0runs counter to the\\xa0mainstream\\xa0Israeli narrative,\\xa0which tends to gloss over the issue of Palestinian expulsions during the war, preferring to highlight the contentious idea that the desert only started ‘blooming’ once Israel was founded.\\n   \\n      Earlier this year, Israel and its allies including the United States and other Western nations skipped\\xa0\\ufeffthe first ever event\\xa0at the United Nations marking the 75th anniversary of the Nakba\\xa0–\\xa0coinciding with the 75th anniversary of Israel’s founding.\\n   \\n      The\\xa0Israeli government\\xa0rejects Nakba commemorations,\\xa0with Israel’s Ambassador to the UN Gilad Erdan saying they “only serve to demonize Israel and further push away any chance for reconciliation.”\\n   \\n      Al-Ghubari said that one of Zochrot’s missions is to make Israeli people more aware of the history, however uncomfortable it is.\\n   \\n      But it’s hard going, he said. Zochrot has in the past tried to install information signs at the sites of the destroyed villages.\\n   \\n      “We put signs up in these locations, but unfortunately, these signs would be removed almost immediately within few hours of few days because some Israelis when they come to that place, they don’t like the idea of that information being there,” he said.\\xa0Al-Ghubari does not know who took the signs down.\\n   \\n      Of the six sites of former villages visited by CNN earlier this week, none had any information about Palestinian villages on display.\\n   \\n      Most people who live in Gaza today still identify as Palestinian refugees and refer to the towns and villages their ancestors were forced to flee as their homes – even if their families have now lived in the enclave for several generations.\\n   \\n      In 1967, Israel\\xa0captured\\xa0Gaza\\xa0during\\xa0the Six-Day War with Egypt, Jordan and Syria, and held it for nearly 40 years before withdrawing troops and\\xa0\\ufeffIsraelis\\xa0settlers in 2005.\\xa0After Hamas took power\\xa0inside\\xa0the enclave\\xa0two years later,\\xa0Israel and Egypt,\\xa0which continued to have full control over entry and exit points to the enclave, including the sea,\\xa0imposed a blockade that critics say transformed\\xa0it\\xa0into “the world’s largest open-air prison.”\\n   \\n      Taghrid Ebead is only 35, but she too has a strong sense of belonging to al-Majdal.\\n   \\n      “We were evacuated in 1948 to Gaza,” she said. Ebead said she grew up wondering what drove her ancestors to flee al-Majdal, asking herself why they left their home, why they would allow it to happen.\\n   \\n      “I used to say that we will not do it again. We will not repeat it. It’s impossible to do what our families and grandfathers did,” she said.\\n   \\n      Then IDF leaflets ordering her to evacuate started dropping from the sky, encouraging residents to move south as the Israeli air force ramped up its operation. Amid the constant airstrikes, she decided she had no choice but to leave her home in Gaza City.\\n   \\n      The family of seven fled on foot and ended up in Khan Younis, some 20 miles south of Gaza City.\\n   \\n      “We faced many difficulties, a lot of shelling everywhere,” she said. “We came to Khan Younis and here was nothing. The first day I slept on dust and we had no covers. A week has passed and my son is ill. We hope to go back. We have suffered a lot, we can’t cope.”\\n   \\n      She said that now, she finally understands why her ancestors fled their homes.\\n   \\n      “It is the fear for our children and destruction and death that made (us) leave. To our children, this will not be history because they are living it, they have seen it,” she said.\\n  ',\n",

       " {'headline': '\\n      Republicans return to ‘fizzled’ Biden impeachment inquiry following 3-week speaker race\\n    ',\n",
       "  'contents': ' \\n(CNN) - While the weekslong speaker fight consumed public attention, the House Republican-led committees leading the impeachment inquiry into President Joe Biden continued to work behind the scenes, holding a string of highly anticipated closed-door interviews and receiving more bank records from Hunter and James Biden.\\n   \\n      But now that Speaker Mike Johnson, a member of the House Judiciary Committee, has been elected, Republicans have the tall task of creating public momentum for an effort that has yet to resonate beyond its far-right base and present evidence that rises to the level of impeachment.\\n   \\n      The inquiry into the president was off to a rocky start before former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy was ousted, but the three weeks of infighting culminating in Republicans electing Johnson have left in its wake an entirely new landscape, exacerbating divisions in the GOP conference and cutting down the legislative calendar to a point where the entire Republican agenda beyond essential functions such as funding the government has lost momentum.\\n   \\n      “We wasted 22 days,” said House Ways and Means Chairman Jason Smith, a Republican from Missouri who leads one of the panels tasked with the inquiry.\\n   \\n      The prospect of when the inquiry can be finished is also thrown into question given the speaker’s race ate up so much of the legislative calendar.\\n   \\n      Another unknown factor is how House Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan – who spent much of the last three weeks running for speaker – will return to the scene.\\xa0Republicans have long relied on Jordan to be their top messenger on hot button issues, but the unwavering opposition Jordan faced from a significant portion of his colleagues exposed the limitations of his reach in the conference.\\n   \\n      Over the course of the three weeks without a speaker, Republican staff with the House Oversight and Judiciary committees maintained that their work was still in full swing. Judiciary spokesman Russell Dye said in a statement to CNN that the inquiry has “ramped up” over the past few weeks from conducting interviews, reviewing bank records and compiling testimony and documents “for future public consumption,” adding “nothing has slowed us down.”\\n   \\n      On Monday, when eight candidates, including Johnson, presented their pitch to be speaker, none of them highlighted the inquiry as a priority, multiple lawmakers in the room told CNN. Johnson though has long been a proponent of the inquiry, is in regular contact with Jordan, and told CNN earlier this month he met with Oversight Chairman James Comer, a Kentucky Republican, in the midst of the speaker’s race when Jordan was still a candidate for an update on Oversight’s work. And some members from the far right say since he is coming from the Judiciary panel, Johnson is best situated to give the inquiry the proper attention and focus.\\n   \\n      The new speaker told Fox News’ Sean Hannity in a Thursday interview that House Republicans will continue to follow the facts and said, “the evidence is coming together.”\\n   \\n      “If, in fact, all the evidence leads to where we believe it will, that’s very likely impeachable offenses,” Johnson said.\\n   \\n      While he acknowledged that some in his party are getting “anxious” and “restless” because “they just want somebody to be impeached,” he stressed that any articles must be based on evidence.\\n   \\n      A source familiar with Johnson’s thinking told CNN, “He believes it’s a fact-finding mission. And he trusts Comer, Jordan and Smith to finalize their investigations, give him a recommendation and he supports the chairmen.”\\n   \\n      House Judiciary Committee member Rep. Jeff Van Drew acknowledged to CNN on Thursday that the prolonged speaker’s battle has made the inquiry “fizzled a little.”\\n   \\n      “That slowed things down,” the New Jersey Republican said of the speaker’s race impact on the inquiry. “That was one of my concerns with the entire issue of speaker. The longer we went without one, the more that this would become problematic.”\\n   \\n      That reality is making it even more difficult to get swing district Republicans, many of whom were already skeptical of the inquiry and are now preoccupied with keeping the government open past November 17, onboard with the effort.\\n   \\n      GOP Rep. Jen Kiggans, who represents a Virginia district Biden won in 2020, told CNN, “We have so much work we need to get done including these appropriations bills. Let’s focus on that first.”\\n   \\n      “Do I think that the American people, you know, the majority of American people, actually put that on the front-burner and prioritize that right now? I don’t think so,” GOP Rep. Mike Garcia, who represents a competitive district in California, told CNN of the inquiry. “I think we need to get the trains back on the rail and get our government running again, avoid a shutdown, fund the government. And then look at those things.”\\n   \\n      Even Rep. Ralph Norman, a conservative hardliner from South Carolina, posed to CNN, “Have the facts increased? I would make the argument that they did. And so, the public needs to know it. Now, I don’t know whether we can pass it in here or not.”\\n   \\n      And while a number of Republicans want the panels to continue their investigative work, they recognize it is not the top priority of the conference.\\n   \\n      “I do think that James Comer and Jim Jordan will continue with their investigations and if they’re able to bring forward enough evidence that we can convince the Americans that there is the need for impeachment, then at that stage I would think we would move forward,” GOP Rep. Austin Scott of Georgia told CNN. “But right now, it’s about making sure we don’t end up in a shutdown and continuing to get the appropriations measures passed. So, I think the investigations continue, but it’s not a front burner issue for me.”\\n   \\n      CNN has reached out to the White House for comment.\\n   \\n      House Republicans have not held an impeachment inquiry hearing since their first one on\\xa0September 28, where expert witnesses brought in by Republicans acknowledged they did not yet have the evidence to prove the accusations leveled against the president.\\n   \\n      “When you’re at bat, you get more than on swing,” Van Drew said of the first hearing. “I don’t know that every hearing is going to show what we want.”\\n   \\n      After that hearing, GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida congratulated a number of Democratic lawmakers on their performance against Republicans on the House floor, multiple sources told CNN.\\n   \\n      “They think the hearing was a dumpster fire,” one Democratic lawmaker who spoke to Republicans shared with CNN.\\n   \\n      The House Oversight Committee was at one point looking at bringing in Hunter Biden business associate Tony Bobulinski in October at a second inquiry hearing, a source familiar told CNN, but those plans have yet to come to fruition.\\n   \\n      Now that a new speaker is elected, Democrats are also expected to try to invalidate the impeachment inquiry since it was unilaterally started under McCarthy and never received an official floor vote, a Democratic aide familiar with the plans told CNN.\\n   \\n      GOP Rep. Ken Buck of Colorado, who serves on the Judiciary panel and has said he does not believe there is evidence to impeach the president, told CNN that the way the House Oversight and Judiciary panels have operated behind the scenes during the three weeks without a speaker proved why an inquiry was not necessary from the beginning.\\n   \\n      “That was the reason why I was saying there wasn’t a need to call it an impeachment inquiry because these committees were moving forward,” Buck said. “They continue to move forward, and as they gather evidence, we will see if there’s that connection.”\\n   \\n      Judiciary Committee member GOP Rep. Chip Roy of Texas told CNN that the inquiry “might have been paused for a week or so” while Jordan was running for speaker but insisted “we’re doing a lot of work.”\\n   \\n      The dueling demands have meant that members may have been less involved, even if committee staff plows ahead. For example, while the Judiciary Committee was conducting a voluntary transcribed interview with California US Attorney Martin Estrada on Tuesday to discuss his involvement in the Hunter Biden criminal case, Jordan was stuck in yet another member forum as the conference was trying to elect a new speaker nominee.\\n   \\n      As news broke that Jordan’s panel had secured an unprecedented, closed-door interview with special counsel David Weiss about his ongoing criminal probe into Hunter Biden, the culmination of months of back and forth with the Department of Justice, Jordan was meeting with holdouts who were blocking his bid for speaker.\\n   \\n      Still, his allies feel confident that Jordan can rise to the occasion.\\n   \\n      “Chairman Jordan is an indispensable leader on the Judiciary Committee,” fellow Judiciary committee member Rep. Ben Cline of Virginia said after Jordan’s bid for speaker ended. “I think Jordan is going to be needed in his role as judiciary chair in the next several months to come.”\\n   \\n      Gaetz, who led the effort to oust McCarthy, told CNN that he feels more comfortable having Johnson in the speaker chair handling the inquiry than McCarthy and drew this comparison of the two: “I think the impeachment inquiry would benefit from having a skilled lawyer in the speaker’s office rather than a California lottery winner.”\\n  ',\n",

       " {'headline': '\\n      How a single year of Elon Musk turned Twitter into a husk of its former self\\n    ',\n",
       "  'contents': ' \\n      It’s been one year to the day since Elon Musk completed his purchase of Twitter for $44 billion and set the company, along with its employees and users, off on a whiplash-inducing series of twists and turns.\\n   \\n      Twelve months on, the company barely resembles its former self — and not only because Musk renamed it “X” and did away with its iconic blue bird branding. Through a dizzying and haphazard barrage of changes, Musk has transformed a profitable company once regarded as the world’s go-to source for breaking news and political commentary into a widely ridiculed platform that’s fighting just to break even and crippled by debt; that’s struggling to manage spam and disinformation; that’s alienated some of its biggest advertisers and users; and that’s casting about for purpose.\\n   \\n      Even as Musk — and new CEO Linda Yaccarino — push their vision for X as an “everything app,” the company has seemingly no clear path back to prominence or respectability, or to recouping Musk’s massive investment.\\n   \\n      Driving the transformation has been a relentless stream of layoffs, resignations and policy reversals, as well as messy product rollouts and unfulfilled promises. The company faces a series of legal challenges brought by everyone from former employees to company contractors and landlords that have further complicated its outlook. X is also the subject of multiple regulatory investigations by the US Federal Trade Commission, Securities and Exchange Commission and EU officials that could potentially lead to penalties, both for the company as well as Musk himself.\\n   \\n      X claims engagement is up,\\xa0but the company appears to use different metrics than it did prior to the Musk takeover, making a true comparison difficult.\\xa0Visits to the company’s website are down 14% compared to last September, far outstripping the 3.7% decline industrywide over the same period, according to a report this month by the internet monitoring firm Similarweb.\\n   \\n      Yaccarino said in a statement Thursday that she is “incredibly proud of the work our team has been doing to accelerate the future of X.” The X CEO highlighted some of the new products and features launched over the past year, including the ability for companies to post job listings, longer posts, and audio and video calls for Premium users, which rolled out this week. She said that X is “a place where everyone can freely express themselves, so long as they do so within the bounds of the law,” and added that safety remains a “critical priority” for the platform.\\n   \\n      “If we can achieve all of this in just 12 months, just imagine the scope of our ambition for next year,” Yaccarino said.\\n   \\n      X is now facing perhaps its biggest test yet under new ownership amid the ongoing Israel-Hamas war — and numerous tech watchdogs and civil society groups have raised alarms about false claims and propaganda linked to the conflict on the platform. And as next year’s elections in the United States and elsewhere raise fears about the further spread of misinformation campaigns, X’s value to the public conversation appears increasingly in doubt.\\n   \\n      All of this unfolded over the course of just 365 days. But for many, likely including beleaguered users who have decamped for alternatives such as Threads, Mastodon and BlueSky, it’s felt more like a decade. Here’s a (non-exhaustive) account of how Musk has fundamentally changed Twitter since he made one of the most consequential acquisitions of the social media age.\\n   \\n      In a series of rolling layoffs in the months after his takeover, Musk axed what he would later describe as roughly 80% of the company’s headcount.\\n   \\n      Few departments were left untouched by the layoffs. They affected positions in some of the company’s most critical areas: policy, trust and safety, communications, ethical AI, search and more. The result was a hollowed-out workforce charged with maintaining rickety systems that had already been described as brittle, and which Musk further shrunk in an effort to cut costs. Under Musk, the company’s technical infrastructure proved increasingly prone to meltdowns, resulting in a series of glitches earlier this year affecting users’ ability to use the site.\\n   \\n      Along the way, Musk fired — or accepted the resignations of — key members of Twitter’s old guard, including its former CEO and CFO, as well as its general counsel, policy chief, chief privacy officer, chief information security officer, director of product management and head of trust and safety. Even some of the people who rose to become Musk’s trusted lieutenants at the company have already left.\\n   \\n      The workforce cuts have prompted repeated questions, including from US lawmakers and regulators, about the platform’s ability to respond to threats to security and privacy, along with elections, misinformation and hate speech. And thousands of former employees have accused Musk of providing fewer severance benefits than they were promised, and some also allege he’s delayed severance benefits and payments to cover executives’ work-related legal fees.\\n   \\n      In his zeal to restore what he describes as “free speech” to X, Musk has made numerous policy and product decisions that have altered what users can see on the platform.\\n   \\n      He reversed Twitter’s ban on former President Donald Trump based on an unscientific poll of his followers, after previously saying the decision would be up to a “content moderation council” that never materialized. He also reinstated the suspended accounts of white supremacists and conspiracy theorists. He temporarily suspended several journalists from Twitter for their reports on a third-party account devoted to tracking Musk’s private jet (despite previously criticizing the platform’s suspension practices).\\n   \\n      Under Musk’s leadership, the company removed specific protections for transgender people from Twitter’s hateful conduct policy. X made it easier for politicians and political candidates to qualify for newsworthiness exemptions from Twitter’s rules, when they would otherwise have their content restricted or removed. The platform overturned a 2019-era ban on political and issue advertising, and issued an updated, “zero-tolerance” policy on violent speech that was nevertheless vaguer and more subjective than what it replaced. And it updated Twitter’s privacy policies to say the company may allow users to opt-in to having their biometric information and job and education history collected by the platform.\\n   \\n      But perhaps no change has been as significant as Musk’s move to replace Twitter’s legacy verification (“blue check”) badges with a new form of verification that no longer carries the explicit assurance of authenticity.\\n   \\n      Days after his takeover, Musk debuted — then un-debuted, and later revived —\\xa0a subscription feature that granted any user a blue verification badge if they paid for the platform’s $8 per month subscription plan.\\xa0Critics warned that the system would lead to impersonation on a massive scale, and undermine a feature that once helped users to trust what they saw on the platform.\\n   \\n      Sure enough, when the feature was first launched, Twitter faced a wave of verified impostors pretending to be everyone from Nintendo to LeBron James. After the platform revoked the badges of accounts who’d been verified under the old system, Musk offered to personally pay for verification for James and several other frustrated, high-profile users.\\n   \\n      Under the new system, users who paid for verification have their posts boosted by the platform’s algorithm. And more recently, X rolled out an advertising revenue share program for verified users, rewarding those that drive engagement with payouts — creating potential financial incentives for engagement farmers and misinformation peddlers who share inflammatory or misleading claims.\\n   \\n      As it dismantles old ways of thinking about content moderation, X leaders have repeatedly touted “Community Notes,” an expanded version of the “Birdwatch” user-generated moderation system that Twitter launched in 2021. X said this week that Community Notes now has more than 100,000 volunteer user-moderators in 44 countries who are participating in adding contextual labels to content on the platform.\\n   \\n      But numerous reports have suggested that Community Notes is struggling to meet its mission, burdened by issues like delays in users adding labels and bad actors attempting to game the system. (Yaccarino said in Thursday’s statement that Community Notes are getting faster, and that “this product is not perfect, but it is improving rapidly.”)\\n   \\n      In the meantime, Musk has also antagonized and pushed away many journalists who previously contributed to the spread of reliable information on the platform. Most notably, NPR and PBS abandoned the platform entirely in April after X labeled them as “state-affiliated media,” a designation the broadcasters said misleadingly implied they receive substantial backing from government entities or are not editorially independent. The platform later changed the label to “government-affiliated media” and then did away with it altogether, but the outlets have not returned.\\n   \\n      Many of Musk’s content and product decisions have also led to what civil society groups have reported as a troubling spread of hateful speech on the platform.\\n   \\n      In the early days of Musk’s takeover, many of Twitter’s largest advertisers — including the likes of General Mills and the Volkswagen Group — paused their spending over concerns about X’s layoffs, content moderation capabilities and general uncertainty about the platform’s future.\\n   \\n      The mass advertiser pullback tanked the company’s revenue, and it still has yet to fully recover. Musk has lashed out over the brand revolt, accusing his critics of deliberate sabotage and even going so far as to sue one watchdog group, the Center for Countering Digital Hate, and threatening to sue the Anti-Defamation League, alleging they damaged the brand with claims about surging hate speech on X.\\n   \\n      For its part, X has claimed hate speech is down and has touted new brand safety controls that purport to allow advertisers to restrict what kinds of content their ads can run next to. But even those safety offerings appeared to run into some early road bumps.\\n   \\n      The company’s leaders have offered conflicting views on the state of its finances — making it unclear when and if X’s business can be revived.\\n   \\n      Musk said in July that the company remained cash flow negative because of a 50% decline in ad revenue and heavy debt load. A month later, Yaccarino said many top advertisers had returned and the company was “close to breakeven.” The next month, Musk said US advertising revenue was “still down 60%.” Weeks later, Yaccarino said the company could return to profitability early next year.\\n   \\n      Meanwhile, the banks that lent to Musk to finance his takeover are still struggling to offload the debt due in part to the billionaire’s chaotic leadership, the Wall Street Journal reported this week.\\n   \\n      Yaccarino’s ascension to CEO in June\\xa0signaled Musk’s commitment to winning back advertisers; her track record as an NBCU ad executive, along with the cheery persona she projected on X, seemed to foretell a brighter future for the company. But as Musk has continued to make off-hand announcements about the company’s roadmap, at times seemingly taking Yaccarino by surprise, outsiders have widely wondered about the true extent of Yaccarino’s authority and influence within the company.\\n   \\n      In an interview last month, Yaccarino stressed that she does have autonomy from Musk as CEO. “Elon works on the technology and dreams up what’s next,” she said. “I bring it to market.”\\n   \\n      Through it all, Musk has become the platform’s most consistent main character, weighing in on the largest issues of the day whether he is informed about them or not. When Paul Pelosi was brutally attacked in his own home, Musk baselessly amplified fringe conspiracy theories about the assault. He recommended that X users monitor the Israel-Hamas conflict by following an account known for spreading disinformation, before later deleting his post. He has obliquely defended “Dilbert” creator Scott Adams over racist comments and has condemned the financier George Soros, a frequent target of antisemitic conspiracy theories.\\n   \\n      Musk appears to harbor an obsession with his own popularity on the platform, reportedly pressuring engineers to boost his own posts in users’ feeds after complaining his posts got fewer views than President Joe Biden’s during the Super Bowl.\\n   \\n      In other contexts, Musk has leveraged his ownership of Twitter to promote politicians he personally favors, such as by helping to launch Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis’ presidential campaign by way of a live Spaces event plagued by technical glitches. A week after that event, Musk held another Spaces event to promote Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., the vaccine skeptic and another presidential hopeful, and he promoted an interview between former Fox host Tucker Carlson and another republican contender, Vivek Ramaswamy.\\xa0He has also hosted Benjamin Netanyahu, the conservative Israeli prime minister for a live discussion on X.\\xa0 Musk has said he’s willing to host candidates from across the ideological spectrum, but so far few if any politicians whom Musk disagrees with have been promoted in similar events.\\n   \\n      And, in an attempt to prove that former Twitter executives deliberately discriminated against conservatives on the platform, Musk provided a handpicked group of journalists with selective access to company records. The resulting reports, known as The Twitter Files, purported to reveal a nefarious campaign of suppression. However, the internal communications actually corroborated existing accounts of how Twitter struggled to handle a 2020 New York Post article involving Hunter Biden and his laptop. Musk’s own lawyers later would go on to dispute the insinuations and allegations in The Twitter Files as they tried to prevent Trump from pursuing a case against the company in court.\\n   \\n      Musk has also used the platform to promote his other companies and to hit back at his detractors — everyone from former employees to various regulatory bodies scrutinizing his ownership of the platform.\\n   \\n      It is perhaps Musk’s all-consuming presence that has most undermined what users used to love about Twitter. The platform was once a place to hear from lots of different kinds of voices; where any given user might be leading the day’s “discourse” with the newsiest, most entertaining or controversial bit of content; where there was indeed sometimes toxicity, but it was generally overpowered by useful, up-to-the-minute news and commentary.\\xa0Now, it’s the Musk show, and users increasingly seem inclined to tune out.\\n  ',\n",

       "  'contents': ' \\n  Editor’s Note: Sign up for CNN’s Meanwhile in China newsletter which explores what you need to know about the country’s rise and how it impacts the world.\\n \\n      Former Chinese Premier Li Keqiang, once seen as a reform-minded contender to the country’s top leadership role, died of a sudden heart attack early Friday in Shanghai, state media reported.\\n   \\n      He was 68 years old.\\n   \\n      Li, who was nominally China’s No. 2 leader until late last year, served as the country’s premier – traditionally in charge of the economy – for a decade from 2013 to March this year under strongman leader Xi Jinping.\\n   \\n      During his time in the role, Li navigated the world’s second-largest economy through a challenging period of rising technology and trade tensions with the United States, mounting government debt and unemployment, and the Covid-19 pandemic.\\n   \\n      In his final year in power, the economist by training had been a strong voice warning of challenges to China’s economy amid widespread Covid-19 lockdowns, while backing efforts to boost employment and maintain economic stability.\\n   \\n      Li, known to use his English language skills on occasion in appearances outside the mainland, was also seen as representing a different approach to China’s ties with the world, at a time when the country’s relations with the West have grown increasingly strained.\\n   \\n      “China and the United States have common interests,” Li said in response to CNN’s question at his annual press conference in March 2021. “The two countries need to put more energy on their common ground and expand converging interests.”\\n   \\n      As the news of Li’s death broke Friday morning, social media users circulated a line from Li’s yearly address to China’s rubber stamp parliament in 2022, where he pledged that, “No matter how the international environment may change, China will keep the course of wider openness.”\\n   \\n      Li, a highly educated technocrat with degrees in law and economics, was considered friendly to the private sector. He was also seen to have a diverging policy stance from Xi, who has tightened the ruling Chinese Communist Party’s control over the economy.\\n   \\n      Li oversaw much of China’s efforts to prop up economic growth during his decade-long tenure and remained a supporter of the global integration of China’s economy, even as he found himself increasingly sidelined by Xi.\\n   \\n      As international doubts grew in recent years over Beijing’s resolve to continue the “reform and opening” policy, Li had repeatedly told foreign corporate executives and local officials that such economic development remained the party’s priority.\\n   \\n      During the country’s Covid lockdowns, he held meetings instructing various government departments to clear logistical hurdles for foreign companies to resume production.\\n   \\n      “(Li) was the only member of the Politburo Standing Committee to have openly advocated for the continuation of (former leader) Deng Xiaoping’s open-door policy, which ran counter to the instincts of Xi Jinping,” said Willy Lam, a senior fellow at the Jamestown Foundation think tank in the US, pointing to Xi’s inclination toward state-controlled measures.\\n   \\n      Li is also remembered for his focus on addressing societal ills – with social media users on Friday also pointing to his comments noting that 600 million people in China – or roughly 40% of the population – still had a monthly income of 1,000 yuan ($137).\\n   \\n      Those remarks, made during the premier’s annual press conference in 2020, served as a reminder of China’s ongoing struggle to lift people out of poverty, even as Xi hailed China’s efforts in this regard as a point of national pride.\\n   \\n      During the pandemic, where Beijing’s policies brought large swathes of the country to a halt, Li called local officials to “earnestly” implement policies to stabilize the economy and support small businesses and employment.\\n   \\n      He was also the highest level official to visit Wuhan in January 2020, when the city was under lockdown and battling a surge of infections in the world’s first known Covid-19 outbreak.\\n   \\n      Some of Li’s efforts to bolster the economy appeared to underscore his rift with Xi, and the premier was widely seen as lacking power relative to many of his predecessors.\\n   \\n      When the premier called for the revival of street stalls as a way to jump start growth and fix a spiraling jobs crisis, his proposal met with criticism from a number of state media outlets.\\n   \\n      The backlash from party mouthpieces sparked speculation of conflict between the two most senior party figures over how to stimulate the economy amid strict pandemic controls.\\n   \\n      Li is widely seen as a protege of Xi’s predecessor, Hu Jintao, who presided over an era of rapid growth in China from 2002 to 2012. The men shared economic sensibilities and rose to power through the Communist Party’s Youth League, once seen as a training ground for future leaders.\\n   \\n      The faction was known for producing reform-minded leaders hailing from humble family backgrounds, but its influence is believed to have been crushed by Xi since he came to power.\\n   \\n      The relationship between Li and Hu was in the spotlight last year when the former top leader was unexpectedly led out of the closing ceremony of the October 2022 Communist Party Congress, where Xi further consolidated power.\\n   \\n      In a moment of drama during a usually highly choreographed event, Hu was escorted from the room, pausing on his way out to pat a stony-faced Li on the shoulder, who nodded and turned to watch the former leader depart. State media later suggested Hu left due to health issues.\\n   \\n      Under Hu, Li was named to the party’s top leadership body, the Politburo Standing Committee, in 2007.\\n   \\n      He previously held key roles as party chief in industrial Liaoning province and was provincial leader of Henan, an agricultural base.\\n   \\n      Born in Anhui, Li spent his late teens doing manual labor with the Dongling Production Brigade in the eastern province during the Cultural Revolution, a decade-long social and political upheaval launched by late Chinese leader Mao Zedong.\\n   \\n      Li was among the first batch of students to sit the college entrance exam after it was reinstated following the end of the Cultural Revolution. In 1978, he enrolled at the prestigious Peking University, where he studied law and later obtained a doctorate in economics.\\n   \\n      Unlike Xi, Li is not considered one of China’s princelings hailing from a prominent party family. He held positions in the Communist Youth League Central Committee during the 1980s and ’90s.\\n   \\n      His time in the top echelons of the party ended last October, when he was not named to its Central Committee during a twice-a-decade leadership reshuffle that saw Xi surround himself with key allies.\\n   \\n      Then 67, Li was one year short of the unofficial retirement age for senior Chinese Communist Party leaders.\\n   \\n      He was succeeded as premier earlier this year by former Shanghai party chief and Xi loyalist Li Qiang.\\n   \\n      Alfred Wu, an associate professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy at the National University of Singapore, said that Li’s exit from power meant that there were not many reform-minded senior cadres left in the leadership.\\n   \\n      “This is the hard reality we are going to face. China has departed from the future that Li’s vision had represented,” he said.\\n  ',\n",

At least for a 75-year-old woman in the northern Italian city of Pavia who won a court order after suing to have her sons, aged 40 and 42, removed from her house, a court clerk in Pavia told CNN\\xa0Friday.\\n   \\n      The two sons, described in court papers by their mother as “parasites,”\\xa0had been living\\xa0in the family apartment without\\xa0contributing financially or helping around the house, according to the complaint filed by the woman, who has not been named, in a the\\xa0Tribunal of Pavia district\\xa0court.\\xa0Both men are\\xa0employed, the court documents state.\\n   \\n      Judge Simona Caterbi sided with the retired mother, who is separated from the men’s father and whose pension went entirely on food and maintenance of the home, ruling that the two\\xa0“bamboccioni,” or big babies, have until December 18 to vacate the premises, according to Tuesday’s court ruling,\\xa0seen by CNN.\\n   \\n      Caterbi wrote: “There is no provision in the legislation which attributes to the adult child the unconditional right to remain in the home exclusively owned by the parents, against their will and by virtue of the family bond alone.”\\n   \\n      The men, who hired lawyers to fight the maternal eviction, according to the local newspaper La Provincia Pavese, argued that Italian parents are required by law to take care of their children as long as necessary.\\n   \\n      Caterbi cited the existing law in her ruling and agreed that “the stay in the property could initially be considered well founded because the law is based on the maintenance obligation incumbent on the parent.”\\n   \\n      She then ruled that “it no longer appears justifiable considering the two defendants are subjects over 40 and once a certain age has been exceeded, the child can no longer expect the parents to continue the maintenance obligation beyond limits that are no longer reasonable.”\\n   \\n      A lawyer for the men told local media that the men had not decided if they would appeal the court decision.\\n   \\n      This is not the first time “mammoni,” an Italian term used to describe adult men who are too dependent on their mothers, has cropped up in the legal system.\\n   \\n      In 2020, Italy’s\\xa0Supreme Court\\xa0ruled\\xa0against\\xa0a 35-year-old man who worked as a\\xa0part-time music teacher\\xa0who still expected financial support from his parents\\xa0after he argued that he could not support himself on an annual salary of 20,000 euros ($21,100).\\n   \\n      On average, Italians leave their parental home at the average age of 30, according to Eurostat 2022 data.

       "  'contents': ' \\n      Hye Minyi can still vividly recall what happened in Itaewon, South Korea, on the night of October 29, 2022.\\n   \\n      That was when the trendy nightlife district in the heart of Seoul became the site of one of the country’s deadliest disasters, when a massive crowd surge during Halloween celebrations killed more than 150 people and left the nation reeling.\\n   \\n      Hye, 22, was with her older cousin Amy at a street bar in Itaewon at the time. They were among hundreds who had gathered at the many bars and restaurants that line the district’s streets and alleyways.\\n   \\n      Hye can well remember how panic began to spread through the increasingly crowded streets; how people began jostling for air and space; and how quickly the situation began to spiral out of control.\\n   \\n      “It became a completely different scene,” Hye told CNN. People were “kicking and screaming” as she tried to break away and escape and she fell to the floor. “I actually thought there had been a killer in the crowd,” she said.\\n   \\n      From where she lay on the ground, she could see other revelers, many in Halloween costumes and many already dead. “Time might have passed but I can’t forget what happened on Halloween,” she said.\\n   \\n      “I still have nightmares (of it) almost every day.”\\n   \\n      By the end of the night, 159 people would be dead, many of them young Koreans in their 20s and 30s.\\n   \\n      Hye suffered a broken ankle and severe bruisings from being badly trampled on and was in hospital for weeks. She also suffered painful migraines for days.\\n   \\n      Halloween is widely celebrated in the US every year on October 31, its origins dating back centuries. In Asia however, it is largely considered a Western holiday – one celebrated by expats, and has only recently increased in popularity among more locals\\n   \\n      Halloween festivities have become more common in most major cities like Tokyo, Taipei, Hong Kong, Shanghai and Singapore. But rather than young children going trick or treating, the occasion is more often a chance for young adults to dress up in costume and go partying.\\n   \\n      Whether the disaster in Itaewon last year will put a dent in this growing popularity is yet to be seen. However, various nightlife districts throughout Asia are stepping up precautions aimed at preventing a similar tragedy from occurring.\\n   \\n      South Korean officials say they have increased crowd control measures, security protocols and site inspections in at least 14 public areas across Seoul where they anticipate large crowds will gather for Halloween.\\n   \\n      In Japan, authorities are encouraging young people to avoid popular areas in the nightlife district of Shibuya, which has become a popular gathering spot on Halloween night.\\n   \\n      “We are extremely concerned that there could be a repeat of the Itaewon tragedy,” said Shibuya mayor Ken Hasebe. “Until last year, we have asked people to behave themselves at Halloween but this year we are being bolder (by) saying to people: please don’t come.”\\n   \\n      Drinking in the streets will be banned between 6 p.m. and 5 a.m. on Halloween as well as the days leading up to it, Hasebe said,\\xa0adding that liquor stores in the vicinity have been asked not to sell alcohol. Street security would also be stepped up, with more police and security guards being deployed to control crowds.\\n   \\n      “Every year during Halloween, the area around Shibuya Station becomes so crowded that it is nearly impossible to move,” Hasebe said. “The streets of Shibuya are not party venues. The damage caused by overtourism has become serious.”\\n   \\n      In the city of Guangzhou in southeastern China, operators of an underground metro service have banned “scary makeup and dressing” on trains to “prevent any potential panic.”\\n   \\n      “During Halloween activities, if a passenger is wearing scary makeup, we may ask them to remove it before entering the station,” the operators said in a statement.\\n   \\n      Areas in some stations will be cordoned off to allow passengers to remove make up before boarding trains.\\n   \\n      The Itaewon crowd crush was South Korea’s worst\\xa0peacetime disaster since the sinking of a ferry in 2014 killed 304 people – among them 250 students and teachers from the Danwon State High School.\\n   \\n      Like the ferry sinking, the Itaewon crush shone a spotlight on the South Korean government for its response to the tragedy. Critics accused it of being too slow to respond and of failing to take accountability for what happened that night.\\n   \\n      But authorities have continued to face criticism, and this year, they appear to not be taking any chances.\\n   \\n      The Seoul Metropolitan Government announced a slew of new measures “to ensure a safe Halloween” – including a new CCTV system to monitor crowd numbers.\\n   \\n      “We anticipate that 14 areas in Seoul, including Itaewon in Yongsan-gu, will experience a high level of crowding during the Halloween season,” the metropolitan government said in a statement on October 13.\\n   \\n      “In every area expecting mass gatherings, one way traffic rules will be applied and on-site safety officers wearing reflective vests and carrying light batons will be deployed.\\n   \\n      “If the area becomes overly crowded, subway trains may skip that location, and road access can be restricted to secure sufficient space for pedestrians. In addition, emergency medical support systems will be put in place to proactively prevent safety incidents – this includes the operation of on-site situation rooms and the deployment of ambulances for urgent situations.”\\n   \\n      Today, Itaewon shows few overt signs of the horrors that took place – save for a few makeshift memorials such as walls of post-it notes paying tribute to those who died there.\\n   \\n      Locals and tourists alike have since returned to its bars and restaurants, driven in part by government incentives aimed at reviving the area.\\n   \\n      But to survivors and bereaved families, there are painful memories everywhere.\\n   \\n      One survivor, who wanted to be known only by her last name Lee, told CNN that she had not been back to Itaewon since the tragedy and has been trying to block out all reminders of Halloween.\\n   \\n      “This Halloween is going to be a hard time not just for me but for a lot of people,” she said.\\n   \\n      She and many other survivors and families remain critical about what they see as a continuing lack of accountability over the disaster.\\n   \\n      Kim Ho-kyung, whose daughter died in the crush,\\xa0read a message for President Yoon Suk Yeol during\\xa0a press conference on October 18 saying that\\xa0the bereaved were still waiting for “a sincere apology.”\\n   \\n      She invited the president to a memorial service organised by civil groups and the families of the victims scheduled to take place on Sunday.\\n   \\n      On his Facebook a week later, the Interior and Safety Minister Lee Sang-min expressed his “deepest condolences to those who were sacrificed in the October 29 disaster a year ago, and pray that they may rest in peace.”\\n   \\n      Extending his “deepest sympathy” to the families, he said that “as the minister in charge of disaster and safety, I feel sorry for failing to protect the precious lives of the people and feel an infinite sense of responsibility.”\\n   \\n      He added: “The way to ensure that the unfortunate sacrifices of the deceased are not in vain is to make sure that such an incident does not happen again.”\\n   \\n      Even so, Lee and many others say they doubt whether the lessons of that awful night have truly been learnt.\\n   \\n      Lee is certain of one thing, however – that she is “never going back to the area again.”\\n   \\n      “For me, Halloween and the Itaewon tragedy are (inextricably) linked,” she said. “It’s impossible to see reminders everywhere and not think about the death of friends that night.”\\n  ',\n",

       " {'headline': '\\n      Rubiales’ unwanted kiss on Jennifer Hermoso ‘derailed’ joy of Spain’s Women’s World Cup success, says FIFA Secretary General\\n    ',\n",
       "  'contents': ' \\n      FIFA’s outgoing Secretary General Fatma Samoura said she was encouraged by the global support\\xa0Jenni Hermoso\\xa0received after\\xa0Luis Rubiales’ unwanted kiss on her following Spain’s triumph in the\\xa0Women’s World Cup final, saying the Spanish football federation president’s actions partly “ruined” the tournament and “derailed” the world champion’s joyous celebrations.\\n   \\n      “I didn’t take one second to realize that, oh, that was very inappropriate,” Samoura told CNN Senior Sports Analyst Darren Lewis at the recent Best of Africa Awards in London.\\n   \\n      The fallout over Rubiales’ behaviour during the medal ceremony in August triggered a crisis in Spanish soccer and sparked condemnation in Spain and across the world.Following weeks of fierce criticism, Rubiales resigned last month as the country’s soccer president.\\n   \\n      Rubiales, 46, is now under investigation for “the crimes of sexual assault and coercion,” in a case being brought by Spanish prosecutors.\\n   \\n      “The way that the world reacted, with the majority of the people who liked sport and also respect the dignity of women, was the right thing to do,” added former UN diplomat Samoura, who is FIFA’s first woman and first African Secretary General.\\n   \\n      She suggested the reaction to what Rubiales did was similar to other global movements’ outpouring of activism against systemic abuse.\\n   \\n      “And it reminds me what happened after George Floyd was killed, that the whole world reacted in a manner that we have also never experienced before, because racism has no place in society. Gender bias is definitely not something we can accept in football.”\\n   \\n      Floyd’s death at the hands of police in 2020 is viewed by many as a racially transformative moment, though others argue the “racial reckoning” phrase has become a rhetorical decoy, a way to avoid facing the deepest problems about race in America instead of a call to confront them.\\n   \\n      During her time at FIFA, Samoura has worked on two men’s World Cups, in Russia and Qatar, and two Women’s World Cups, the most recent of which, in Australia and New Zealand, she says was “ruined by a one second gesture.”\\n   \\n      Public outcry to the unwanted kiss, which happened on the presentation stage after Hermoso had collected her winner’s medal came from every sphere of Spanish society, including from politicians and sports stars.\\n   \\n      One consequence of the scandal was the removal of World Cup-winning manager Jorge Vilda\\xa0from his role.\\n   \\n      “The [Spanish] girls, after having won this most coveted trophy in global women’s football, could not enjoy it to the best,” said Samoura, adding that the incident “really derailed from the joy.”\\n   \\n      “I know that football can unite the world … and to have it ruined at the last minute after this celebration of the biggest World Cup, was just something that was unfortunate,” she continued.\\n   \\n      “My message to Jenni and to all the Spanish team was, okay, keep on fighting for your rights, keep on also positioning women’s football, keep on focusing on your victory, and hopefully with all the vibes coming from the support you’ve been receiving worldwide, you will keep on winning and winning.”\\n   \\n      Samoura was recently given a lifetime achievement award at the Best of Africa Awards in recognition of the legacy she has created in the sport.\\n   \\n      When asked if FIFA was ready to have a female president, Samoura said: “I hope one day, and not before too long, we will also see a woman leading football. I think this is a possibility.\\n   \\n      “It’s not up to me to decide on that. I think we have to have 211 member associations deciding who’s the best for the FIFA president. And besides that, we have a young and very competent president [Gianni Infantino] and he still has some years to go.”\\n   \\nInfantino has been in the role since 2016 and though he has ushered in several reforms alongside Samoura, he has had detractors, too.\\n   \\n      Human rights groups like Amnesty International and FairSquare did not feel he did enough for the plight of migrant workers in Qatar in the build to the 2022 tournament, while Norway\\xa0 FA president Lise Klaveness directly addressed concerns she had about the ethical questions of migrant workers, the rights of women and the LGBTQI+ community at the organisation’s Congress in Doha last year.\\n   \\n      Klaveness, alongside the Norwegian and Swedish representatives in Kigali at the most recent FIFA Congress this past\\xa0March,\\xa0also did not join other delegates who rose to applaud Infantino when he was\\xa0re-elected as president after standing unopposed.\\n   \\n      “But I think that for women, nothing is impossible. We have seen very competent women leading member associations,” Samoura added.\\n   \\n      Samoura leaves FIFA at the end of the year and is hoping to spend more time with family.\\n   \\n      She said she would leave confident that the organization was in a better place now than when she took up her role following a spate of corruption scandals under former president Sepp Blatter and her predecessor Jérôme Valcke.\\n   \\n      “I don’t like talking about myself because it’s teamwork. It takes 1,000 people to organize the World Cup, it takes even more to fight all forms of discrimination in the stadium,” said Samoura.\\n   \\n      “But I can definitely associate myself with a company that went from disgrace, and from being considered as a toxic brand, to a company that is now invited to the biggest economic forum and to the biggest media to talk about sport and only sport.\\n   \\n      “We are succeeding because of teamwork and\\xa0putting football in the centre of everything we do.”\\n  ',\n",

       " {'headline': '\\n      Taylor Swift is now a billionaire, Bloomberg says\\n    ',\n",
       "  'contents': ' \\n      Taylor Swift has another accolade to add to her lengthy resume this year: America’s favorite pop star is now a billionaire, according to a Bloomberg analysis.\\n   \\n      The outlet, which runs the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, said Swift’s total net worth is now at $1.1 billion, thanks to a record-breaking Eras tour that helped boost the US economy this summer.\\n   \\n      Bloomberg said Swift is one of the few entertainers to reach that status based on just her music and performance.\\n   \\n      Chris Leyden, director of growth marketing at SeatGeek, previously told CNN that “Taylor Swift’s ‘Eras’ tour is rewriting the playbook of entertainment economics.”\\n   \\n      “She’s not just a performer — she’s an economic phenomenon,” Leyden said.\\n   \\n      Swift has dominated not only Super Bowl-sized arenas, but local movie theaters as well. In its opening weekend, the pop singer’s concert film, “Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour,” raked in about $96 million in the box office in the United States and Canada, making it the highest-groatssing concert film domestically for an opening weekend, according to AMC.\\n   \\n      The Eras tour could gross $2.2 billion in North American ticket sales alone, according to August\\xa0survey data from research firm QuestionPro provided to CNN exclusively. That unprecedented total represents primary ticket sales for the US shows that Swift just concluded in Los Angeles, plus a second North American leg coming next year. That would make it the highest-grossing tour ever.\\n   \\n      It brought a boost to the economy in its many stops through North American cities – the final six nights of Taylor Swift’s Eras tour in Los Angeles were estimated to bring\\xa0$320 million to the city, according to the California Center for Jobs and the Economy.\\n   \\n      She’s even putting the NFL on the map – at least for those who already weren’t tuning in to Sunday Night Football. News that the star was\\xa0rumored\\xa0to be attending an Oct. 1 game to see Kansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce has sent ticket prices soaring more than 40% — from $83 to $119 – according to TickPick, an online marketplace.\\n   \\n      The singer became a cultural phenomenon, adding to her economic influence. In cities where Swift performed,\\xa0ridership on public transit spiked\\xa0and\\xa0hotel occupancy skyrocketed. Santa Clara, the tech-rich city located in Northern California,\\xa0briefly became\\xa0“Swiftie Clara.” In Seattle, dancing Swifties caused seismic activity that\\xa0one seismologist said was equal to a 2.3 magnitude earthquake.\\n   \\n      The star is adding another album rerelease on Friday – “1989 (Taylor’s Version),” which earned a total of 10 Grammy nominations at the time it was released.\\n   \\n      Swift\\xa0announced\\xa0in 2019 that she planned to re-record her first six studio albums after her former label sold her master recordings. She has since released “Taylor’s Version” albums for “Red,” “Speak Now” and “Fearless.”\\n   \\n      Swift can now join the ranks of Rihanna, who became a billionaire in 2021, according to Forbes. Though it’s been years since Rihanna dropped an album, she spent that time building her business empire through her\\xa0Fenty Beauty\\xa0makeup line and her\\xa0Savage x Fenty\\xa0lingerie line. Jay Z and Beyoncé reached the milestone in 2017.

       " {'headline': '\\n      Abandoned golf courses are being reclaimed by nature\\n    ',\n",
       "  'contents': ' \\n  Editor’s Note: Call to Earth is a CNN editorial series committed to reporting on the environmental challenges facing our planet, together with the solutions.\\xa0Rolex’s Perpetual Planet initiative\\xa0has partnered with CNN to drive awareness and education around key sustainability issues and to inspire positive action.\\n \\n      Golf courses, despite occupying large green spaces, are not necessarily good for the environment. Land is often cleared to make way for a fairway and maintaining the pristine turf often requires a lot of water, regular mowing and the spraying of fertilizers and pesticides – none of which is good for biodiversity.\\n   \\n      In the US, with the number of course closures outweighing new openings every year since 2006, some are questioning how we should use these huge spaces – and asking whether, instead of golf, nature should be left to run its course.\\n   \\n      Conservation nonprofits and local authorities are looking to acquire golf courses that have been abandoned due to high maintenance costs, low player numbers or other reasons, and repurpose them into landscapes that boost biodiversity and build natural defenses against climate change.\\n   \\n      These spaces provide “huge opportunities from a conservation perspective,” says Guillermo Rodriguez, California state director of The Trust for Public Land (TPL), a conservation organization which is rewilding three of the state’s former courses.\\n   \\n      “It’s a multiple win,” he continues. “You increase public access by taking former private golf courses (and) turning them into public properties … (you return) water back into rivers and streams and create a better habitat for the endangered species that we have in California.”\\n   \\n      Take San Geronimo, an 18-hole course in northern California’s Marin County, located on two waterways, which are home to endangered coho salmon and steelhead trout. Since the course’s construction in 1965, much of the water from San Geronimo and Larsen Creek was being diverted to provide irrigation for the course, affecting fish populations in the area, says Rodriguez.\\n   \\n      In 2018, TPL purchased the 157-acre site and began converting the area back into its natural state: turning off the irrigation, removing culverts and dams built to capture water and starting to restore the habitat by planting native species. According to TPL, the rewilding process could take up to 10 years, but\\xa0there are signs that wildlife is already bouncing back, with bobcats spotted roaming the area.\\n   \\n      Rodriguez admits that initially TPL’s plan received some strong opposition from the public, especially from the golfers. But after efforts to involve locals in the design and opening hiking and biking trails in the area attitudes are changing. Now known as San Geronimo Commons, the site is a thriving center for the local community, he says.\\n   \\n      Further down the coast in Santa Barbara is another of TPL’s acquisitions: Ocean Meadows. The nine-hole course was built in the 1960s on the site of a wetland. To create it, developers filled the plain with 500,000 cubic yards of soil.\\n   \\n      TPL purchased the 64-acre area in 2013 and started restoring the wetlands, removing the soil that had been added during construction and planting native vegetation. Since then, migratory birds have replaced birdies, and at least two pairs of threatened western snowy plovers are successfully breeding in the area’s mudflats.\\n   \\n      With the extreme shifts in weather patterns in recent years, especially in California, the benefits of having a wetland rather than a golf course have become clear, says Rodriguez. “Floodplains are able to kind of capture this water, protect infrastructure, protect other low-lying communities, and really let nature be an important solution,” he says.\\n   \\n      Most recently, TPL acquired Rancho Cañada, a 190-acre private golf course located in Monterey. It wants to widen and restore the riverbed and banks of the Carmel River, which runs through the course, helping to protect downstream neighborhoods from flooding.\\n   \\n      Crucially, the site will become part of a wider network of protected land, enabling a wildlife corridor from Ventana to Fort Ord. “The ability to remove fencing and create much more cohesion between the previous golf course and the surrounding public lands, really builds that connectivity back,” says Rodriguez.\\n   \\n      TPL is not the only organization on a mission to rewild golf courses. In Akron, Ohio, Summit Metro Parks acquired the 195-acre Valley View Golf Course in 2016, returning it to its natural state. In doing so it connected three local parks and created 1,900 contiguous acres of green space.\\n   \\n      The site has transformed, says Mike Johnson, chief of conservation at the nonprofit. Today, 90% of the vegetation is native, whereas the same percentage was non-native or invasive when it was a golf course, he says.\\n   \\n      “Golf courses are harsh environments, and to create them the vegetation used is usually non-native … It doesn’t have value for our local fish and wildlife,” he tells CNN.\\n   \\n      “We had to undo the golf course before we could restore the landscape,” he says, adding that they removed the levees, allowing the rivers and streams to run freely, and stripped out the turf and non-native trees before establishing a native cover of vegetation.\\n   \\n      “The response from wildlife has been huge,” he adds. “Prior to our work, we documented about 200 species of plant and wildlife that were living on the golf course at the time we acquired it. Today we have documented over 900 species of fish and wildlife that have returned to this area.”\\n   \\n      Across the pond, in the UK, a similar movement is underway. Frodsham golf course in Cheshire, where top Liverpool footballers like Michael Owen once teed off, was bought by the UK’s Woodland Trust last year, with the plan to plant 40,000 native trees on the site.\\n   \\n      “It’s still too soon to report any significant changes, but this summer more wildflowers were growing across the site because the fairways, greens, tees were not being mown as they would have been when it was being managed as a golf course,” says Neil Oxley, site manager for the Woodland Trust.\\n   \\n      The site will contribute to The Northern Forest scheme, an effort to plant 50 million trees across 10,000 square miles stretching coast to coast from Liverpool to Hull. Currently, the area only has 7.6% woodland cover, but the initiative hopes to increase this to 20%.\\n \\n      In other areas of the country, local councils are repurposing unprofitable municipal golf courses to create more natural spaces. Erewash Borough Council is working with Derbyshire Wildlife Trust to turn the Pewit golf course into a nature reserve, after noting that few people were using it and it was a substantial drain on the council’s resources. Brighton and Hove City Council is rewilding the 220-acre Waterhall course to restore the area’s chalk grasslands.\\n   \\n      In the Melbourne suburb of Elwood, Elsternwick Park golf course has been transformed into a natural oasis, providing respite from the city both for wildlife and the local community.\\n   \\n      Bayside City Council, which decided to repurpose the course upon expiration of its lease, came up with a plan to create different habitats, from open water and swamp scrub to wetlands and woodland, that support a range of species. Although the project began in 2018 and is expected to take at least 10 years to complete, already the council has recorded more than 100 different indigenous plant species growing at the site.\\n   \\n      The plan also includes a network of paths so that visitors can explore and learn about the urban ecology. In 2022, the site was renamed Yalukit Willam Nature Reserve to recognize the Yalukit Willam clan of the Boon Wurrung people, who traditionally owned the land.\\n  ',\n",

       "  'contents': ' \\n  Editor’s Note: Call to Earth is a CNN editorial series committed to reporting on the environmental challenges facing our planet, together with the solutions.\\xa0Rolex’s Perpetual Planet initiative\\xa0has partnered with CNN to drive awareness and education around key sustainability issues and to inspire positive action.\\n \\n      Golf courses, despite occupying large green spaces, are not necessarily good for the environment. Land is often cleared to make way for a fairway and maintaining the pristine turf often requires a lot of water, regular mowing and the spraying of fertilizers and pesticides – none of which is good for biodiversity.\\n   \\n      In the US, with the number of course closures outweighing new openings every year since 2006, some are questioning how we should use these huge spaces – and asking whether, instead of golf, nature should be left to run its course.\\n   \\n      Conservation nonprofits and local authorities are looking to acquire golf courses that have been abandoned due to high maintenance costs, low player numbers or other reasons, and repurpose them into landscapes that boost biodiversity and build natural defenses against climate change.\\n   \\n      These spaces provide “huge opportunities from a conservation perspective,” says Guillermo Rodriguez, California state director of The Trust for Public Land (TPL), a conservation organization which is rewilding three of the state’s former courses.\\n   \\n      “It’s a multiple win,” he continues. “You increase public access by taking former private golf courses (and) turning them into public properties … (you return) water back into rivers and streams and create a better habitat for the endangered species that we have in California.”\\n   \\n      Take San Geronimo, an 18-hole course in northern California’s Marin County, located on two waterways, which are home to endangered coho salmon and steelhead trout. Since the course’s construction in 1965, much of the water from San Geronimo and Larsen Creek was being diverted to provide irrigation for the course, affecting fish populations in the area, says Rodriguez.\\n   \\n      In 2018, TPL purchased the 157-acre site and began converting the area back into its natural state: turning off the irrigation, removing culverts and dams built to capture water and starting to restore the habitat by planting native species. According to TPL, the rewilding process could take up to 10 years, but\\xa0there are signs that wildlife is already bouncing back, with bobcats spotted roaming the area.\\n   \\n      Rodriguez admits that initially TPL’s plan received some strong opposition from the public, especially from the golfers. But after efforts to involve locals in the design and opening hiking and biking trails in the area attitudes are changing. Now known as San Geronimo Commons, the site is a thriving center for the local community, he says.\\n   \\n      Further down the coast in Santa Barbara is another of TPL’s acquisitions: Ocean Meadows. The nine-hole course was built in the 1960s on the site of a wetland. To create it, developers filled the plain with 500,000 cubic yards of soil.\\n   \\n      TPL purchased the 64-acre area in 2013 and started restoring the wetlands, removing the soil that had been added during construction and planting native vegetation. Since then, migratory birds have replaced birdies, and at least two pairs of threatened western snowy plovers are successfully breeding in the area’s mudflats.\\n   \\n      With the extreme shifts in weather patterns in recent years, especially in California, the benefits of having a wetland rather than a golf course have become clear, says Rodriguez. “Floodplains are able to kind of capture this water, protect infrastructure, protect other low-lying communities, and really let nature be an important solution,” he says.\\n   \\n      Most recently, TPL acquired Rancho Cañada, a 190-acre private golf course located in Monterey. It wants to widen and restore the riverbed and banks of the Carmel River, which runs through the course, helping to protect downstream neighborhoods from flooding.\\n   \\n      Crucially, the site will become part of a wider network of protected land, enabling a wildlife corridor from Ventana to Fort Ord. “The ability to remove fencing and create much more cohesion between the previous golf course and the surrounding public lands, really builds that connectivity back,” says Rodriguez.\\n   \\n      TPL is not the only organization on a mission to rewild golf courses. In Akron, Ohio, Summit Metro Parks acquired the 195-acre Valley View Golf Course in 2016, returning it to its natural state. In doing so it connected three local parks and created 1,900 contiguous acres of green space.\\n   \\n      The site has transformed, says Mike Johnson, chief of conservation at the nonprofit. Today, 90% of the vegetation is native, whereas the same percentage was non-native or invasive when it was a golf course, he says.\\n   \\n      “Golf courses are harsh environments, and to create them the vegetation used is usually non-native … It doesn’t have value for our local fish and wildlife,” he tells CNN.\\n   \\n      “We had to undo the golf course before we could restore the landscape,” he says, adding that they removed the levees, allowing the rivers and streams to run freely, and stripped out the turf and non-native trees before establishing a native cover of vegetation.\\n   \\n      “The response from wildlife has been huge,” he adds. “Prior to our work, we documented about 200 species of plant and wildlife that were living on the golf course at the time we acquired it. Today we have documented over 900 species of fish and wildlife that have returned to this area.”\\n   \\n      Across the pond, in the UK, a similar movement is underway. Frodsham golf course in Cheshire, where top Liverpool footballers like Michael Owen once teed off, was bought by the UK’s Woodland Trust last year, with the plan to plant 40,000 native trees on the site.\\n   \\n      “It’s still too soon to report any significant changes, but this summer more wildflowers were growing across the site because the fairways, greens, tees were not being mown as they would have been when it was being managed as a golf course,” says Neil Oxley, site manager for the Woodland Trust.\\n   \\n      The site will contribute to The Northern Forest scheme, an effort to plant 50 million trees across 10,000 square miles stretching coast to coast from Liverpool to Hull. Currently, the area only has 7.6% woodland cover, but the initiative hopes to increase this to 20%.\\n \\n      In other areas of the country, local councils are repurposing unprofitable municipal golf courses to create more natural spaces. Erewash Borough Council is working with Derbyshire Wildlife Trust to turn the Pewit golf course into a nature reserve, after noting that few people were using it and it was a substantial drain on the council’s resources. Brighton and Hove City Council is rewilding the 220-acre Waterhall course to restore the area’s chalk grasslands.\\n   \\n      In the Melbourne suburb of Elwood, Elsternwick Park golf course has been transformed into a natural oasis, providing respite from the city both for wildlife and the local community.\\n   \\n      Bayside City Council, which decided to repurpose the course upon expiration of its lease, came up with a plan to create different habitats, from open water and swamp scrub to wetlands and woodland, that support a range of species. Although the project began in 2018 and is expected to take at least 10 years to complete, already the council has recorded more than 100 different indigenous plant species growing at the site.\\n   \\n      The plan also includes a network of paths so that visitors can explore and learn about the urban ecology. In 2022, the site was renamed Yalukit Willam Nature Reserve to recognize the Yalukit Willam clan of the Boon Wurrung people, who traditionally owned the land.\\n  ',\n",

Much of what is known about embryo development comes from animals such as mice, rabbits, chickens and frogs, with research on human embryos very tightly controlled and regulated in most countries.\\n   \\n      But animal studies can only tell researchers so much. What happens during human embryo development, particularly in the crucial first month, remains largely unknown.\\n   \\n      “The drama is in the first month, the remaining eight months of pregnancy are mainly lots of growth,” said Jacob Hanna, a professor of stem cell biology and embryology at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel. “But that first month is still largely a black box.”\\n   \\n      Being able to peer into that black box would open up a world of biomedical possibilities, allowing scientists to demystify a previously obscure window of embryo development — ultimately leading to a better understanding of miscarriages, congenital birth defects and the side effects of medications taken during pregnancy. And some researchers believe they’ve found a way to do it that bypasses the need for eggs or sperm.\\n   \\n      Harnessing advances in stem cells, labs around the world are making embryo-like structures — a group of cells that acts like an embryo but can’t grow into a fetus.\\n   \\n      Recent breakthroughs in the field, the culmination of years of painstaking lab work, have generated hope and some alarm, raising urgent questions\\xa0about the ethical status of these models, to what extent they should be treated like human embryos and whether they are open to misuse.\\n   \\n      The embryo-like structures are essentially clumps of cells grown in a lab, which are smaller than a grain of rice and represent the very earliest stages of human development, before any organs have formed. They don’t have a beating heart or a brain.\\n   \\n      The most advanced models, revealed in September by an Israeli team that Hanna was part of, show all the cell types that are essential for an embryo’s development — the placenta, yolk sac, chorionic sac (outer membrane) and other tissues that an embryo needs to develop.\\n   \\n      The structures were left to develop for eight days — reaching a developmental stage equivalent to day 14 of a human embryo in the womb — an important moment when natural embryos acquire the internal structures that enable them to proceed to the next stage: developing the progenitors of body organs.\\n   \\n      Hanna said\\xa0they were the most accurate models developed so far and, unlike those created by other teams, no genetic modification had been made to turn on the genes necessary to generate the different types of cells, only chemical nudges.\\n   \\n      “It’s not only you put the cells together, and they’re there,” he said. “But you see the architecture, you start also seeing very fine details,” Hanna said.\\n   \\n      Hanna’s team made no use of fertilized eggs. They started out with human cells known as pluripotent stem cells, which have the potential to be programmed into many cell types and are widely used in biomedical research. Some of them were derived from adult human skin cells.\\n   \\n      The team then reprogrammed these cells into what they term a “naïve state” — corresponding to day seven in the development of a natural human embryo, around the time it implants itself in the womb. These “naïve” cells were divided into three groups.\\n   \\n      One group, intended to become the embryo, was left untouched. The two other groups were “nudged” with the use of certain chemicals that turn on specific genes to develop into the tissues needed to sustain the embryo, such as the placenta. After two days, the three groups are then put together, Hanna said.\\n   \\n      “In the first three days, you don’t see much, you just see a clump of cells that is growing,” he explained. “But by day four, you start seeing … this has a structure, you know, you can see where the embryo is going to form … and see where the yolk sac is going to be.”\\n   \\n      At the stage equivalent to day seven, the synthetic human embryo models were aggregates of about 120 cells, together measuring some 0.01 millimeter across. By day 14, they contained about 2,500 cells and measured 0.5 millimeters.\\n   \\n      Hanna and his team say the models faithfully emulate the way an early embryo gains all the structures it needs to begin its transformation into a fetus. The inner organization matched images in embryology atlases produced in the 1960s, and when they applied secretions from the cells to a commercial pregnancy test it came out positive.\\n   \\n      However, only 1% of the aggregated cells went on to self-organize into an embryo-like structure. A much higher percentage would be needed to make the embryo models a useful tool for scientists, something that is possible, Hanna said, but would likely take years to perfect.\\n   \\n      “I think we will be able to learn an awful lot from these stem-cell based embryo models. There are some drawbacks at the minute. They’re very inefficient to make … so clearly the efficiency has to be increased to really\\xa0maximize what we can learn from these models,” said Peter Rugg-Gunn at a news briefing this week. Rugg-Gunn is group leader and head of public engagement at the Babraham Institute, which focuses on life science research.\\n   \\n      To date, none of the embryo models have been grown beyond the equivalent of 14 days, largely because of the limitations and challenges involved in culturing these structures.\\n   \\n      However, 14 days is an important milestone because it is when permitted lab research on cultured human embryos routinely ends. The boundary was established by the United Kingdom’s Fertilisation and Embryology Act in 1990 in the wake of public concern about test tube babies before in vitro fertilization was widely accepted, as well as worries that scientists were ignoring the special moral status of human embryos. The 14-day rule was subsequently adopted by several other countries, eventually becoming an internationally recognized ethical limit.\\n   \\n      This limit, which some scientists want to extend, doesn’t apply to stem-cell based embryo models, which the International Society for Stem Cell Research said should not be considered as embryos. However, the organization did recommend that research involving the models have required ethical oversight. \\n \\n      It’s possible in the future that these models could be used to study human development well beyond the 14-day point. Hanna and other groups have grown mouse embryo models to a later equivalent point. He said, in the future, it might be possible to go as far as 40 days with human embryo models.\\n   \\n      However, dystopian fears that scientists studying the models are trying to create an alternative way to produce human life are the stuff of science fiction, Hanna said.\\n   \\n      “People think immediately we’re trying to, you know, replace pregnancy or gestation with this embryo model, but it’s really not, not only is it not the goal but also I don’t think it’s ever going to be possible,” he said.\\n   \\n      As current research stands, embryo models are still rudimentary, with clear scientific differences from a human embryo and no potential to form a fetus.\\n   \\n      Also, the International Society for Stem Cell Research prohibits the transfer of any embryo model to the uterus of a human or an animal in its guidelines.\\n   \\n      “I want to stress that these models are not embryos and every jurisdiction and society… that’s been looking at this have said it should be illegal to attempt to plant any stem cell-based embryo into a woman or human ones into an animal uterus. That should be forbidden,” said Robin Lovell-Badge, a professor and head of the Laboratory of Stem Cell Biology and Developmental Genetics at the Francis Crick Institute in London, who helped draft the guidelines, at the briefing.\\n   \\n      Many scientists argue that human embryo models, especially if they can be produced in great numbers, offer an ethical alternative to research on scarce and precious human embryos that are usually obtained as a by-product of IVF.\\n   \\n      “Because of their stem cell base, we can scale everything up. We can do experiments on them that we are not able to do on precious, rare (human) embryos. And so it just changes the types of experiments we can do and the questions we can answer,” said Naomi Moris, group leader at the Francis Crick Institute’s Developmental Models Laboratory in London.\\n   \\n      One potential application could be drug screening and research. Pregnant people have often been excluded from drug trials because of concerns about the safety of the parent and unborn child.\\n   \\n      In her lab, Moris has conducted experiments with embryo models to see how they respond to medications like thalidomide, a drug that was once marketed as a treatment for morning sickness that is already known to cause birth defects.\\n \\n      The goal was to find out “are they susceptible to these drugs that we know are going to be toxic to the early embryo and then can we use (the embryo model) to screen drugs we actually don’t know about?” she said.\\n   \\n      Moris agreed that the models shouldn’t be classified as embryos given their stem-cell origins and because they still lack certain features, however, she noted it was impossible to know for sure.\\n   \\n      “We can’t do the golden experiment which would be to put it into uterus and see if it can carry on growing, and without being able to do that experiment — quite rightly — how can we as researchers decide whether we’ve crossed that boundary and tipped over into what we would call an embryo? I think this is a big question. And it’s not an easy one to answer,” Moris said.\\n   \\n      Some in the field envision a “tipping point” wherein human embryo models might be afforded some protection like those surrounding human embryos, as scientific advances diminish the differences between the embryo models and their real-life counterparts.\\n   \\n      It’s also possible that future stem cell-based models could replicate the development of milestones such as the emergence of primitive neural folds, arms buds and early heart-like regions, which may have the potential to develop into beating heart tissue, circulating blood and neurons, according to a paper on the need for national policy and governance on human embryos published in the journal Genetics & Development in August.\\n   \\n      “With yet further advances, it will become increasingly difficult to be certain that the models could not reach the point of pain perception, consciousness or viability,” the paper’s authors noted.\\n   \\n      “Thus the public will soon ask, quite rightly, whether … (embryo models) are appropriately regulated? Are scientists using them in ethically responsible, socially acceptable and suitably accountable ways?”\\n   \\n      Hanna believes that it will be possible to design and genetically modify human embryo structures so that they will be developmentally limited — unable to produce brain cells or heart tissue — allowing scientists to navigate some of the ethical issues.\\n   \\n      Researchers agree that the emerging field needs better regulation as the research advances, addressing what should and should not be permitted.\\n   \\n      “The law is obviously lagging way behind the science and technology,” Moris said.\\n   \\n      “I think that we’re quite keen as researchers to be pushing at the forefront … to get regulation in place,” she added. “Because scientists like working within lines, we feel much more comfortable if we know we’re on the right side of the public perceptions of the field. We’d be a lot happier if we had a clear set of guidelines and regulations that we should all work under.”\\n   \\n      In the UK, the Governance of Stem-Cell Based Embryo Models project, which Moris is involved in, has convened academic researchers, legal scholars, bioethicists and research funders to prepare a set of guidelines for working with the technology. The group expects to publish a draft governance framework in the new year, Moris said.\\n   \\n      Bobbie Farsides, a professor of clinical and biomedical ethics at Brighton and Sussex Medical School, who is also part of that group, said that what was remarkable to her was that scientists themselves are deeply engaged with the ethical issues.\\n   \\n      “When I first worked in these sorts of spaces, it very much felt like society or the public that were worried and the lawyers and the regulators were trying to sort out the scientists,” Farsides said. “What we’ve got now is the scientists themselves saying, ‘OK, how are we going to reassure the public? How are we going to self-regulate? Where are we going to draw red lines?’ And I think that’s a huge sea change.”\\n  ',\n",

And it’s not an easy one to answer,” Moris said.\\n   \\n      Some in the field envision a “tipping point” wherein human embryo models might be afforded some protection like those surrounding human embryos, as scientific advances diminish the differences between the embryo models and their real-life counterparts.\\n   \\n      It’s also possible that future stem cell-based models could replicate the development of milestones such as the emergence of primitive neural folds, arms buds and early heart-like regions, which may have the potential to develop into beating heart tissue, circulating blood and neurons, according to a paper on the need for national policy and governance on human embryos published in the journal Genetics & Development in August.\\n   \\n      “With yet further advances, it will become increasingly difficult to be certain that the models could not reach the point of pain perception, consciousness or viability,” the paper’s authors noted.\\n   \\n      “Thus the public will soon ask, quite rightly, whether … (embryo models) are appropriately regulated? Are scientists using them in ethically responsible, socially acceptable and suitably accountable ways?”\\n   \\n      Hanna believes that it will be possible to design and genetically modify human embryo structures so that they will be developmentally limited — unable to produce brain cells or heart tissue — allowing scientists to navigate some of the ethical issues.\\n   \\n      Researchers agree that the emerging field needs better regulation as the research advances, addressing what should and should not be permitted.\\n   \\n      “The law is obviously lagging way behind the science and technology,” Moris said.\\n   \\n      “I think that we’re quite keen as researchers to be pushing at the forefront … to get regulation in place,” she added. “Because scientists like working within lines, we feel much more comfortable if we know we’re on the right side of the public perceptions of the field. We’d be a lot happier if we had a clear set of guidelines and regulations that we should all work under.”\\n   \\n      In the UK, the Governance of Stem-Cell Based Embryo Models project, which Moris is involved in, has convened academic researchers, legal scholars, bioethicists and research funders to prepare a set of guidelines for working with the technology. The group expects to publish a draft governance framework in the new year, Moris said.\\n   \\n      Bobbie Farsides, a professor of clinical and biomedical ethics at Brighton and Sussex Medical School, who is also part of that group, said that what was remarkable to her was that scientists themselves are deeply engaged with the ethical issues.\\n   \\n      “When I first worked in these sorts of spaces, it very much felt like society or the public that were worried and the lawyers and the regulators were trying to sort out the scientists,” Farsides said. “What we’ve got now is the scientists themselves saying, ‘OK, how are we going to reassure the public? How are we going to self-regulate? Where are we going to draw red lines?’ And I think that’s a huge sea change.”\\n  ',\n",

Decades of research back up the saying that you are what you eat and support the important health effects of good nutrition.\\n   \\n      Healthy food choices increase people’s overall life expectancy and reduce the risk of developing a wide variety of medical issues, including heart disease and cancer.\\n   \\n      The health effects of food don’t just stop at the body. They extend into the mind as well, affecting not only our risk of future brain-based conditions (such as stroke and dementia) but also our ability to think clearly in the moment as well as our mood and mental health.\\n   \\n      But it’s not so easy to know what to eat for brain health, or even how to measure it. Many of us have been told that foods such as blueberries, salmon, nuts and leafy greens are so-called brain foods. But how do they work? Are they neuroprotective? Do they make us smarter? More alert? Less stressed? Happier?\\n   \\n      Nutritional psychiatrist Dr. Uma Naidoo has built a career around figuring out which foods improve brain function and positively influence the way we feel. She is the director of nutritional and lifestyle psychiatry at Massachusetts General Hospital, an instructor at Harvard Medical School, an author and a personal chef.\\n   \\n      Naidoo described the nascent and rapidly growing field as the “intersection between nutrition and mental health.”\\n   \\n      “We’re not at the point where I can say, ‘Eat this number of blueberries in order to improve your mood.’ But we are definitely emerging and growing in the scientific evidence to be able to say, ‘You can construct a nutritional psychiatry plate for your mood,’” she told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta recently on his podcast Chasing Life.\\n   \\n      The number of blueberries or ounces of salmon we have to eat in a day to improve our mood is unclear, Naidoo said, but the Standard American Diet, often referred to as SAD, that so many consume is not helping our mental health.\\n   \\n      This way of eating is called SAD for a reason, she said. It’s calorie-dense and nutrient-poor, full of refined carbs, bad fats and added sugars while lacking in fresh fruits, vegetables, whole grains and clean protein.\\n   \\n      “Any time that we can add those leafy greens, those actual whole foods onto our plate … and step away a little bit from those processed fast foods, the healthier we are going to become as a country,” she said, adding that ultraprocessed foods are engineered to trick our brain, so that we are almost unable to stop overeating.\\n   \\n      What can you do to nourish your brain and boost your mood? Naidoo serves up these five tips. And to learn more about the brain benefits of eating a well-balanced diet and how what you eat affects your mood, listen to Naidoo go into detail on Chasing Life.\\n   \\n      Eighty percent of your diet should focus on real, whole, fiber-rich foods such as vegetables, fruits, nuts, seeds, legumes and lower-glycemic whole grains, healthy fats and high-quality, well-sourced protein, Naidoo said. For the remaining 20%, there is leeway for “enjoying life as it comes.”\\n   \\n      “Following an 80/20 rule allows for dietary discipline with some flexibility. … Adopting this mindset allows us to get all the mind-calming nutrients that we need while avoiding the guilt that sometimes comes along with being inflexible,” she said.\\n   \\n      It’s something that you hear often: Eat an assortment of vegetables and fruits in a wide variety of colors.\\n   \\n      “To optimize the nutrient quality of your diet, be sure to eat the rainbow,” Naidoo said.\\xa0“Different colored plant foods contain different brain-boosting nutrients, such as plant polyphenols.”\\n   \\n      She tells people to lean into all the different vegetables, but she’s not leading with potatoes and sweet potatoes. “I’m leading with cruciferous vegetables and leafy greens and legumes and lentils and beans.”\\n   \\n      Don’t forget fruit to “get those natural sugars into your body rather than reaching for the candy bar that we know is not the healthiest choice,” she said. “I want people to understand we need sugar for our bodies and our brain cells, so it’s where you get the sugar that’s important.”\\n \\n      Naidoo said that plant-rich eating also provides plenty of fiber “to support a healthy and thriving microbiome, which influences a healthier body and mind. Similarly, fiber helps to keep inflammation down and helps calm the mind.”\\n   \\n      Fruits and vegetables in all colors of the rainbow are great, but Naidoo pays particular attention to the color green.\\n   \\n      “We all know that greens do a body good, and in nutritional psychiatry we know that greens do a mind good, too,” she said, explaining that they contain folate, a B vitamin, which is a building block of important neurotransmitters such as norepinephrine, serotonin and dopamine.\\n   \\n      “Folate has been associated with a decrease in depressive symptoms and overall improved cognition, which supports a happy and clear mind,” she said. “I suggest 4 to 6 cups of greens like spinach, kale, arugula, spring mix or dandelion greens per day. And arugula is a cruciferous vegetable, so think about using it as your salad greens or even for a nutrient-dense pesto.”\\n \\n      Listen to your body, Naidoo said.\\n   \\n      “An important aspect of mental well-being is mindfulness and the capacity to acknowledge how things make you feel and act accordingly,” she said.\\n   \\n      “If something doesn’t make you feel good or perform well after eating it, there are likely better dietary choices out there. Pay attention to your mental health symptoms and your physical body in response to various foods and use this body intelligence to guide you.”\\n   \\n      Inflammation is one of the root causes of stress and low mood, Naidoo said. “When inflammation occurs in the gut as a result of added/refined sugars, processed foods and industrial seed oils (soy, corn, and grapeseed), the mind becomes overwhelmed, stressed and anxious,” she said.\\n   \\n      “When nutrient-poor foods, such as those typically comprising a standard Western diet, are replaced with an abundance of fruits and vegetables, healthy fats (especially omega-3s) and proteins, the gut calms down and stress is relieved within the body and mind.”\\n   \\nWe hope these five tips help you nourish your brain to improve your mood. Listen to the full episode\\xa0here and find out what Dr. Uma Naidoo has to say about two often controversial food groups: carbs and meat. And join us next week for a special Halloween episode of the\\xa0Chasing Life podcast when Dr. Sanjay Gupta talks to the “King of Horror,” author Stephen King.\\n \\nCNN Audio’s Eryn Mathewson contributed to this report.\\n',\n",

On Tuesday, the 34-year-old professional basketball player arrived at the Ball Arena in Denver, Colorado for the latest LA Lakers game against Denver’s Nuggets. If James wanted to make a sartorial statement for his first game of the season, it came in the form of the forest green Speedy bag from Louis Vuitton which sat at his hip — one of the standout pieces from Pharell’s debut collection as creative director of menswear this summer.\\n   \\n      James paired the cross-body bag with a custom tweed “Damoflage” jacket (Pharell’s pixelated, Minecraft-esque print which has already become a brand motif, endorsed by Kim Kardashian and Rihanna), sunglasses and black derby shoes. He follows in the footsteps of several famous men of late who have been seen sporting not just any functional receptacle, but an “it bag.”\\n   \\n      This year, Australian actor Jacob Elordi (who is set to star as Elvis in Sofia Coppola’s forthcoming biopic “Priscilla”) has appeared with a series of highly coveted luxury bags slung over his shoulder including, but not limited to, a Bottega Veneta Cassette bag, a Chanel Mini Messenger, a Burberry Sanford leather tote, a Valentino Loco bag and a yellow version of James’ LV Speedy. “No one can separate Elordi from his fancy bags,” wrote one user on X.\\n   \\n      Similarly, fashion-forward musicians Tyler the Creator and A$AP Rocky are also batting for the man bag — Tyler has owned an turquoise quilted Chanel number since at least 2018, as well as a green Goyard trunk bag, while earlier this month A$AP was snapped rocking a Barbie-pink Bottega Andiamo.\\n   \\n      A gendered stigma has long been attached to men who wear shoulder bags, however. In series five, episode 13 of “Friends” (“The One with Joey’s Bag”), when Joey debuts a new leather tote bag, his masculinity and sexual orientation is persistently mocked by Chandler and Ross. Indeed, men wearing bags are consistently the butt of jokes in internet memes, comic strips, and even\\xa0 stand-up comedy sets. “You better keep a gun in here bro,” comic Andrew Schulz told a male audience member who attended a 2019 show wearing a small leather satchel.\\n   \\n      But the tide is changing. In August, Pharrell told GQ Magazine that designing accessories was something he was eager to tackle in the Louis Vuitton top job. “One of the things I wanted to do when I got here was I definitely wanted to work on the bags,” he said. Doubtless it’s a dedication appreciated by the likes of James, Elordi, A$AP and Tyler, whose street style looks contribute further proof — were any needed — that man purses are enjoying a newfound socio-cultural appreciation.

If the weather’s nice, you just may be able to see the rise of Japan’s Tsushima Island in the distance.\\n   \\n      From there it’s just a short walk to Blueline Park, the starting point for the Haeundae Sky Capsule. This personal elevated rail car allows you to cruise along the rocky, pine-blanketed edge of Dalmaji Hill while taking in the ample beauty of the shoreline.\\n   \\n      It ends at the old fishing village of Cheongsapo, where you can sit down for a lunch of grilled scallops, shrimp, and other fresh seafood at one of the little restaurants near the harbor.\\n   \\n      While Busan is a modern, high-tech hub, it’s also a treasure trove of historical sites and temples such as Haedong Yonggunsa.\\n   \\n      Just a quick taxi ride from Cheongsapo, this scenic and serene Buddhist site sits perched on a rise above the surging sea and is a rarity in a country where most temples are found on mountains.\\n   \\n      Slow down, breathe in the ocean air and wander its placid grounds to the soothing soundtrack of squawking seagulls and waves exploding on the rocks.\\n   \\n      For a taste of the new Busan, shoot over to the gleaming cluster of high-rises known as Centum City.\\n   \\n      There you can explore Shinsegae Department Store – the largest in the world according to the Guinness Book of World Records – before checking out the lustrous, architectural triumph of the Busan Cinema Center, the headquarters of the Busan International Film Festival.\\n   \\n      While you’re in the neighborhood, make sure to stop by Museum 1, which specializes in multichromatic digital art installations.\\n   \\n      Lose yourself in the mesmerizing, psychedelic wonders of the gallery before ambling back to Shinsegae for the quintessential Korean jimjilbang experience at Spaland, one of the city’s premier saunas.\\n   \\n      Centum City is just a couple stops on the subway from Gwangalli Beach, a happening strip of sand, cafes, bars and eateries looking out across the water to Busan’s iconic Gwangan Diamond Bridge.\\n   \\n      In the summer, Gwangalli hosts a dazzling drone show every Saturday at 8 p.m., and the beach is also home to the Busan International Fireworks Festival, held in early November each year.\\n   \\n      For a unique and adventurous experience, book a sunset SUP (standup paddle board) trip to the bridge and back with Crazy Surfers, who will supply everything you need for the unforgettable jaunt, including instruction in English.\\n   \\n      Gwangalli is also home to some of the city’s best food and nightlife. Scratch your itch for Korean pork barbecue at Seorae, grab a slice of the city’s best pizza SOL Taphouse, or dive into a sashimi feast at the Millak Raw Fish Center, where you can peruse the tanks and point to your meal, which is sliced and served up on the spot.\\n   \\n      For drinks, stop by the always-hopping HQ Bar with its super-friendly staff and million-dollar view of the bridge, or pop in for a cold pint at Galmaegi Brewing Company, one of the city’s original purveyors of craft beer. If it’s well-crafted cocktails in an intimate setting you’re after, check out Joseph, one of several chic new spots to sprout up in the neighborhood’s backstreets.\\n   \\n      Busan is a port town, so to really understand its soul, you should head to the old harbor district of Nampo-dong. This is where you’ll find Jagalchi Market, the open-air seafood exchange that’s not only an intoxicating blast to the senses but also the city’s living, beating heart.\\n   \\n      Meander along its concourse as you take in the scaly, finned and tentacled bounty of the sea, along with the gruff vendors who sell it all.\\n   \\n      Jagalchi is also one of Busan’s best places to eat, and while there are endless opportunities to take your seafood raw, the market is home to a few choice joints that grill your fish over hot coals and serve it all up with an array of peppery and pungent side dishes.\\n   \\n      Across from Jagalchi is the sprawling, maze-like complex of Gukje Market, the setting for the 2014 film, “Ode to My Father.” Stock up on K-pop schwag and other souvenirs, or get down with some noodles, pajeon (green onion pancakes), and Chungmu kimbap (seaweed rolls with spicy radish and squid) on the market’s famous food alley.\\n   \\n      While you’re there, check out the used-book sellers on Bosu Book Street, and in the evening, hook yourself up with a bowl of Busan’s rich, savory, signature pork soup at Bukwang Dwaeji Gukbap, or grab a stool at one of Nampo’s many pojangmacha, the covered street carts that serve bottles of beer, soju and delectable side dishes whipped up by tough, older women.\\n   \\n      These little tents pack everyone together in a way that encourages interaction, and are a welcome throwback to Busan’s more rough and tumble past.\\n   \\n      Just down the road is Busan’s first designated city beach – Songdo – with its popular cable car that whizzes high over the water to Amnam Park, offering unparalleled views of the city’s traditional core, along with the stony mountains and deep turquoise waters that make it such a photogenic place.\\n   \\n      From Songdo it’s just a quick cab over the Namhang Bridge to Yeongdo Island, home to some of Busan’s oldest neighborhoods, including the Huinnyeoul Culture Village. Nestled atop a bluff overlooking the water, this cluster of tiny white, blue and aquamarine houses is arguably the most romantic spot in town, as well as an Instagrammer’s dream.\\n   \\n      While you’re in Yeongdo, make sure to stop by Momo’s Coffee, a spacious cafe and roastery whose co-owner, Jooyeon Jeon, won the 2019 World Barista Championship. Not only is Momo’s famous for its expertly crafted espresso drinks, but is also worth a visit just for the building’s smart and elegant design.\\n   \\n      Yeongdo itself is renowned for its rugged, natural beauty, which reaches a point of perfection in Taejongdae. This must-visit park on the island’s southern tip is made up of thick pine forests, sheer cliffs and massive rocky outcroppings that stretch and crumble into the foamy ocean waves.\\n   \\n      It’s the perfect place to take a stroll and clear your head while the sun’s rays glimmer on the surface of the sea. As you take it all in, you just may forget that you’re in the middle of a modern, bustling city that also happens to be one of East Asia’s most underrated gems.\\n   \\n      There are several easy options for getting to Busan. The city is linked to Seoul by the KTX high-speed train, which takes around two and a\\xa0half hours.\\n   \\n      Direct flights to Busan’s Gimhae International Airport\\xa0from Seoul’s Incheon or Gimpo airports are just an hour.\\n   \\n      While the city is served by direct international flights from some Asian countries, longer international routes will almost always go through Incheon International Airport.\\n  ',\n",

Shot by German photographer Juergen Teller, it also stars American actresses Dakota Fanning and Greta Lee, American actor Mike Faist, British actor Josh O’Connor, South Korean music artist Taeyong, British artist Rachel Jones and Chinese model Fei Fei Sun.\\n   \\n      In one image, she sits on a sofa wearing a black and white turtleneck dress, with a small, pleated, burgundy Loewe Paseo handbag. \\n   \\n      In another, Smith is adorned in a floor-length faux fur coat and holds Loewe’s signature Puzzle bag. \\n   \\n“Heartstopper” actor Sebastian Croft commented under an Instagram post by Loewe Creative Director Jonathan Anderson in which he shared the looks, saying: “It’s so perfect.”\\n   \\n      Smith — who is more recently known for her supporting role as Countess Violet Crawley in the British drama series “Downtown Abbey,” for which she won three out of her four Emmy Awards — garnered international acclaim and received a Best Actress Oscar for her portrayal of an eccentric schoolteacher in the 1969 romantic comedy “The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie.”\\n   \\n      She won another Academy Award nine years later for her supporting role in the 1978 romcom “California Suite” and received a Tony Award for the Broadway production of “Lettice and Lovage” in 1990.\\n   \\n      The actress is one of several older women who have fronted fashion lines and magazine covers in recent years. In March, tattoo artist Apo Whang-Od became Vogue’s oldest cover star with her appearance for Vogue Philippines at the age of 106 and in 2020, aged 85, Oscar-winning actress Dame Judi Dench became the oldest person to ever grace the cover of British Vogue.\\n  ',\n",

Some 40 blocks south, Pandora recently brought to life a competing vision for how stones are made, bought and sold.\\n   \\n      During New York Fashion Week at the start of September, the jewelry retailer shut down the busy thoroughfare of Astor Place to host a splashy party it dubbed the “lab-grown diamond district,” attended by fashion insiders and stars like Pamela Anderson, the face of the brand’s latest campaign.\\n   \\n      Pandora was never a big player in the diamond category. It built its jewelry brand — one of the world’s biggest with nearly $4 billion in revenue last year\\xa0— on charm bracelets that sell for under $100. But the surging popularity of lab-grown stones, which are structurally identical to mined diamonds but sell for a fraction of the price, has opened the doors for even relatively low-cost brands to offer serious bling.\\n   \\n      The company isn’t the only one seeing big sales from this category: Lab-grown diamond brand Brilliant Earth saw a 15.7 percent net sales increase in 2022, to $440 million. Dorsey, another exclusively lab-grown jewelry brand, sold over a million stones last year.\\n   \\n      Brands like these are changing how the jewelry business works: pieces typically fall into certain categories based on the types of materials used and the prices charged. Diamonds were the ultimate luxury signifier, their trade dominated by small, bespoke businesses or big brands like Tiffany and Cartier.\\n   \\n      Lab-grown stones have erased some of those distinctions. First developed in the 1980s, they are produced by exposing pure carbon to a large amount of heat and pressure in a metal cube, eventually creating a diamond. They are virtually indistinguishable from the traditional kind; realizing this, the diamond industry has invested in marketing designed to create two categories of stones in the minds of consumers.\\n   \\n      Those efforts haven’t worked, at least not for the most price-conscious consumers: a Tiffany tennis bracelet runs north of $20,000, while a bracelet containing similar, lab-grown carats from Brilliant Earth is $3,450.\\n   \\n      According to\\xa0jewelry industry analyst Paul Zimnisky, sales of these man-made diamonds have increased from under $1 billion in 2016 to just under $12 billion in 2022. They represent just over 17% of the overall diamond market, according to diamond research firm Edahn Golan. The rate of growth is accelerating: Lab-grown sales shot up 38% from 2021 to 2022.\\n   \\n      The rapid rise of lab-grown stones is reverberating across the market. Pandora has raised its sales outlook twice this year, and its share price has more than doubled in the past year. Meanwhile, the world’s largest diamond producer and distributor De Beers is cutting prices of mined stones by as much as 40 percent due to falling demand for traditional diamonds.\\n   \\n      “For most people, a diamond is a diamond, and what you want is the wonderful sparkle and the beauty and the meaning that you can put into a diamond,” said Mary Carmen Gasco-Buisson, chief marketing officer at Pandora in an interview with the Business of Fashion.\\n   \\n      Many consumers plough the savings from buying a lab-grown diamond into more jewelry — a bigger engagement ring, for instance. The technology has also brought more shoppers into the market to buy pieces for themselves, rather than simply waiting for their partners to do so, said Dorsey founder Megan Strachan.\\n   \\n      To reach those shoppers, brands are adjusting their marketing approach. While diamonds have always been marketed as a luxury, those ads have often been geared towards men buying jewelry for their partners. Now, jewelers are marketing to a broader set of customers, particularly women shopping for fashion items.\\n   \\n      “The lab-grown diamond is not in competition with mined diamonds, it’s a complement to mined diamonds,” said Sayed Haider, COO, merchandising and operations at Diamond Nexus, which added a line of lab-grown diamonds to its offering earlier this year. “You have a beautiful engagement ring, but you want to get a matching set of earrings or a pendant … You can get all those aspirational pieces that you always wanted.”\\n   \\n      Though lab-grown engagement rings are growing in popularity, non-bridal jewelry is where many brands are seeing the most growth.\\n   \\n      Dorsey is focused on selling items like tennis necklaces and bracelets and vintage-inspired earrings. Strachan said the decision stemmed from a feeling that there was a bigger gap to fill in everyday jewelry. As well, she added, it allows for customers to become repeat purchasers, whereas “bridal is a single purchase.”\\n   \\n      “Every time I went into a jewelry store in the past, I always felt like I couldn’t afford it,” she said. “(Lab-grown) is democratizing something that was essentially reserved for the wealthy.”\\n   \\n      Dorsey, which was founded in 2019, saw its sales grow 600 percent from 2021 to 2022, and is on track to double sales again this year. It’s profitable, buoyed by word-of-mouth marketing, particularly among influencers who are finding and talking about the product on their own.\\n   \\n      Marketing around man-made diamonds often performs double duty, both selling the individual item and countering the idea that greater accessibility equates with subpar quality. Dorsey photographs its products in editorial-like spreads that would look at home in the pages of\\xa0Vogue, marketing the jewelry like fashion, said Strachan. The brand’s Instagram feed is filled with sleek images of well-dressed women, including model Bella Hadid and Justin and Hailey Bieber wearing its necklaces.\\n   \\n      “The same way that we choose our shoes, we choose our jewelry, and I felt like that’s been missed (in marketing),” said Strachan.\\n   \\n      Pandora’s fall campaign highlighted the accessibility aspect of lab-grown stones with its tagline, “Diamonds for All,” but its fashion week event, and the hiring of stars like Anderson and model Precious Lee, shows how it too is repositioning its brand.

The views expressed in this commentary are his own. Read more opinion on CNN.\\xa0\\n \\n      Earlier this month, striking writers ratified a deal with major Hollywood studios that was greeted with excitement throughout the entertainment community. In a year of multiple strikes, it represented a major win for workers fighting growing income inequality.\\n   \\n      Now, it’s the actors’ turn to reach a deal with studios — except that the studios have suspended talks with SAG-AFTRA, the union representing us.\\n   \\n      The Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP) walked away from the bargaining table on October 11 and studio executives said they were suspending discussions because they were “no longer moving” forward “in a productive direction.” In short, the actors and studios remain in a stalemate.\\n   \\n      In case you haven’t followed the actors’ strike, the AMPTP and SAG-AFTRA are negotiating revenue sharing and policies around use of artificial intelligence (AI), among other items. Until we get a deal, actors like me remain on the picket lines. And as long as we’re on the picket lines, a lot of great shows won’t be filmed, and a lot of folks who rely on this industry will be out of work.\\n   \\n      Maybe you’re thinking “wait, I thought actors make tons of money?” Well, sure, it can be millions and millions of dollars — if you’re an A-lister. Most of us don’t come anywhere close.\\n   \\n      In my case, you may not know my name, but you might recognize my kind-of-familiar face from one of the shows I’ve appeared in. Some have been pretty big hits over the last five years, including the supernatural drama series “Manifest,” the psychological thriller series “You,” and “Modern Love,” an anthology series about human connection.\\n   \\n      I’m fortunate to have enough success acting full time that I’ve been able to pay my bills and acquire health insurance. Back when my bookings were really booming, I proposed to my now wife and added a dog to our family — the typical sorts of things people do when they have financial stability.\\n   \\n      But it’s never been easy for the average actor to afford the conventional trappings of middle-class life — and it’s getting harder all the time. One big problem for actors is that the business model for Hollywood film productions has completely changed, but the contracts have not. That’s why actors went out on strike in July, a couple of months after the writers did.\\n   \\n      Suffice to say, my not working for the past few months has been a financial hardship on my family. But the roughly 160,000 actors on strike are enduring what we hope to be a short-term pain for long term gains in pay, benefits and job protection. We miss the profession that we love, but we can’t continue to work in conditions that compensate us less than our due and in an industry that fails to safeguard our careers as it embraces AI in a way that potentially could threaten our livelihoods.\\n   \\n      A lot of Hollywood’s biggest stars are on the picket lines too, lending us their moral support, for which I’m grateful. They are fighting with us for fair wages in an industry where the average salary in 2022 was a paltry $27.73 per hour for actors in California, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. But most actors don’t work a 40-hour work week, 12 months a year, so those stats may not fully capture just how precarious our livelihood is.\\n   \\n      Acting is a notoriously tough profession to break into and maintain long-term security. Most of us who could were likely able to make a living did so because we were paid a fair wage based on viewership.\\n   \\n      Prior to the advent of streaming, actors like me relied on residuals paid out based on how often we appeared in a show and how successful it was. That meant essentially, the more views, the more money we earned.\\n   \\n      But the contracts we are operating under do not consider the dramatic increase in streaming numbers and the decline of network and cable viewership. In short, actors work much more to make ends meet and still sometimes find ourselves earning less.\\n   \\n      When streaming first showed up, it had a lot of work to do to draw and maintain audiences. At the time, most of us were working in cable and network TV, which is where the audiences were. That large viewership, and the usage residuals this model provided, is why a lot of us were able to make a living. But the business has completely changed.\\n   \\n      Last year, streaming in the US surpassed cable and network TV in viewership. Many actors depend on residuals from previous programs but in the streaming era, that income has fallen precipitously.\\n \\n      This immense shift has changed the model, and the AMPTP, which represents movie and television producers, including Disney, Warner Brothers and Netflix (CNN’s parent company is Warner Bros. Discovery, which produces movies and television shows.) And even as studios say that they’re being squeezed financially, CEOs continue to earn tens of millions of dollars.\\n   \\n      Meanwhile, SAG-AFTRA says 86% of its members don’t qualify for health care coverage through the union, because they don’t qualify under SAG-AFTRA’s income threshold, which is about $26,500 a year.\\n   \\n      What’s more, many of us live in the most expensive cities in the country like Los Angeles and New York, because that’s where the work and industry infrastructure exists. The average one-bedroom apartment in Los Angeles rents for about $3,000 per month, according to rent.com, which comes to $36,000 per year. So, if you’re a Hollywood actor barely scraping by — well, you can do the math.\\n   \\n      Another major sticking point is how the industry would like to use AI. The AI proposal from the AMPTP impacts the most marginalized and financially vulnerable performers in the entertainment industry — background actors.\\n   \\n      Obviously, the way in which actors’ images will be used is a hugely important issue. SAG-AFTRA negotiators say the proposed contract would pay background actors for a day’s work (they currently are paid at the rate of less than $200 per day), scan their body and use that image any way they want for the rest of the project. The union has also said that the studios want to own that scan to use for perpetuity, without the consent of the background actor and without providing further compensation. The AMPTP rejected this claim, and has said that they will require consent from the actor and the replica would only be used in the movie they signed up for.\\n   \\n      But here’s a sobering thought: AI technology is still incredibly young. We have no way of understanding or knowing what can be done with this information in 10, 20, or 30 years. The potential is limitless and protections for real people need to be put in place now.\\n   \\n      You might be thinking, “With all your reservations about the way the business of Hollywood is run, why don’t you just get a different job?” I’d turn the question around and ask you, “Wouldn’t you fight for the job you love?”\\n   \\n      Acting is my job. It’s more than that – it’s my passion. I’ve done thousands of auditions, performed thousands of hours on stage to hone my craft, finished hundreds of hours of really mediocre improv classes (and some good ones too) and made a cross-country move away from everyone and everything I know to pursue this career.\\n   \\n      I think a lot of people were reminded of the value of on-screen entertainment in their lives during the Covid-19 pandemic. The stories we watched on big and small screens gave us something else to talk about — a way to escape the scary reality just outside our front door.\\n   \\n      Several Hollywood A-listers, including Ben Affleck, Emma Stone and George Clooney, met with SAG-AFTRA leaders this week after the studios suspended negotiations. They’ve made overtures to try to end the strike, according to news reports; I’m hoping that all that star power helps get the talks back on track. The idea that underpaid union workers should “get a different job” while industry executives earn tens of millions of dollars feels like a post-apocalyptic show written by AI. But here we are — in real life.\\n   \\n      Let’s be clear: this fight is about the entire ecosystem that makes your favorite onscreen entertainment run. This includes actors like me, but also casting directors, costume departments, lighting crews, camera operators, producers, teamsters, make-up artists and so many more professionals with real lives, real families and real professional goals. None of us non-executives\\xa0 get rich working in this industry.\\n   \\n      I couldn’t be happier for my extended family in the Writers Guild of America whose sacrifice and determination allowed them to strike a deal with the studio execs that their leaders are happy with. Until the actors can say the same, you won’t find my kind-of-familiar face on screen, but on the picket line.\\n  ',\n",

But the roughly 160,000 actors on strike are enduring what we hope to be a short-term pain for long term gains in pay, benefits and job protection. We miss the profession that we love, but we can’t continue to work in conditions that compensate us less than our due and in an industry that fails to safeguard our careers as it embraces AI in a way that potentially could threaten our livelihoods.\\n   \\n      A lot of Hollywood’s biggest stars are on the picket lines too, lending us their moral support, for which I’m grateful. They are fighting with us for fair wages in an industry where the average salary in 2022 was a paltry $27.73 per hour for actors in California, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. But most actors don’t work a 40-hour work week, 12 months a year, so those stats may not fully capture just how precarious our livelihood is.\\n   \\n      Acting is a notoriously tough profession to break into and maintain long-term security. Most of us who could were likely able to make a living did so because we were paid a fair wage based on viewership.\\n   \\n      Prior to the advent of streaming, actors like me relied on residuals paid out based on how often we appeared in a show and how successful it was. That meant essentially, the more views, the more money we earned.\\n   \\n      But the contracts we are operating under do not consider the dramatic increase in streaming numbers and the decline of network and cable viewership. In short, actors work much more to make ends meet and still sometimes find ourselves earning less.\\n   \\n      When streaming first showed up, it had a lot of work to do to draw and maintain audiences. At the time, most of us were working in cable and network TV, which is where the audiences were. That large viewership, and the usage residuals this model provided, is why a lot of us were able to make a living. But the business has completely changed.\\n   \\n      Last year, streaming in the US surpassed cable and network TV in viewership. Many actors depend on residuals from previous programs but in the streaming era, that income has fallen precipitously.\\n \\n      This immense shift has changed the model, and the AMPTP, which represents movie and television producers, including Disney, Warner Brothers and Netflix (CNN’s parent company is Warner Bros. Discovery, which produces movies and television shows.) And even as studios say that they’re being squeezed financially, CEOs continue to earn tens of millions of dollars.\\n   \\n      Meanwhile, SAG-AFTRA says 86% of its members don’t qualify for health care coverage through the union, because they don’t qualify under SAG-AFTRA’s income threshold, which is about $26,500 a year.\\n   \\n      What’s more, many of us live in the most expensive cities in the country like Los Angeles and New York, because that’s where the work and industry infrastructure exists. The average one-bedroom apartment in Los Angeles rents for about $3,000 per month, according to rent.com, which comes to $36,000 per year. So, if you’re a Hollywood actor barely scraping by — well, you can do the math.\\n   \\n      Another major sticking point is how the industry would like to use AI. The AI proposal from the AMPTP impacts the most marginalized and financially vulnerable performers in the entertainment industry — background actors.\\n   \\n      Obviously, the way in which actors’ images will be used is a hugely important issue. SAG-AFTRA negotiators say the proposed contract would pay background actors for a day’s work (they currently are paid at the rate of less than $200 per day), scan their body and use that image any way they want for the rest of the project. The union has also said that the studios want to own that scan to use for perpetuity, without the consent of the background actor and without providing further compensation. The AMPTP rejected this claim, and has said that they will require consent from the actor and the replica would only be used in the movie they signed up for.\\n   \\n      But here’s a sobering thought: AI technology is still incredibly young. We have no way of understanding or knowing what can be done with this information in 10, 20, or 30 years. The potential is limitless and protections for real people need to be put in place now.\\n   \\n      You might be thinking, “With all your reservations about the way the business of Hollywood is run, why don’t you just get a different job?” I’d turn the question around and ask you, “Wouldn’t you fight for the job you love?”\\n   \\n      Acting is my job. It’s more than that – it’s my passion. I’ve done thousands of auditions, performed thousands of hours on stage to hone my craft, finished hundreds of hours of really mediocre improv classes (and some good ones too) and made a cross-country move away from everyone and everything I know to pursue this career.\\n   \\n      I think a lot of people were reminded of the value of on-screen entertainment in their lives during the Covid-19 pandemic. The stories we watched on big and small screens gave us something else to talk about — a way to escape the scary reality just outside our front door.\\n   \\n      Several Hollywood A-listers, including Ben Affleck, Emma Stone and George Clooney, met with SAG-AFTRA leaders this week after the studios suspended negotiations. They’ve made overtures to try to end the strike, according to news reports; I’m hoping that all that star power helps get the talks back on track. The idea that underpaid union workers should “get a different job” while industry executives earn tens of millions of dollars feels like a post-apocalyptic show written by AI. But here we are — in real life.\\n   \\n      Let’s be clear: this fight is about the entire ecosystem that makes your favorite onscreen entertainment run. This includes actors like me, but also casting directors, costume departments, lighting crews, camera operators, producers, teamsters, make-up artists and so many more professionals with real lives, real families and real professional goals. None of us non-executives\\xa0 get rich working in this industry.\\n   \\n      I couldn’t be happier for my extended family in the Writers Guild of America whose sacrifice and determination allowed them to strike a deal with the studio execs that their leaders are happy with. Until the actors can say the same, you won’t find my kind-of-familiar face on screen, but on the picket line.\\n  ',\n",

       "  'contents': ' \\nA version of this story first appeared in CNN Business’ Before the Bell newsletter. Not a subscriber? You can sign up right here. You can listen to an audio version of the newsletter by clicking the same link.\\n \\n      The Commerce Department is set to report third-quarter gross domestic product Thursday. It’s the broadest measure of economic output, and it’ll likely show that the US economy expanded at a staggeringly rapid pace from July through September, despite higher interest rates, depleted pandemic savings and high inflation.\\n   \\n      The economy is expected to keep growing through the end of the year, though at a slower rate. Some investors say an end-of-year stock rally may be on the table, too. \\n   \\n      The expectation that the economy won’t pick up even more strength may keep the Federal Reserve on track to cutting rates sometime in 2024, since red-hot demand outpacing supply could be maintaining some upward pressure on prices. But how early in the year the Fed begins to cut rates ultimately depends on inflation’s trajectory.\\n   \\n      Fed Chair Jerome Powell has said the central bank needs to see “below-trend growth” to be assured that inflation is on track to slow to 2%, the Fed’s inflation target.\\n   \\n      “The US economy continued to show remarkable resilience over the summer with surprisingly robust job growth and an unexpected consumer spending spree that likely propelled real GDP growth above 5% annualized in (the third quarter),” Gregory Daco, chief economist at EY-Parthenon, wrote in an analyst note. \\n   \\n      “While these signs of economic strength will fuel speculations that the economy is re-accelerating, we do not expect such strong momentum will be sustained.”\\n   \\n      The Fed cuts interest rates whenever unemployment rises sharply or if inflation consistently hovers below 2%. The central bank also doesn’t have any incentive to restrict the economy through elevated interest rates if inflation is already under control. \\n   \\n      Daco expects rate cuts to begin by the middle of next year. \\n   \\n      The Fed’s main strategy to defeat inflation is by slowing demand through rate increases, since higher interest rates make borrowing to purchase cars and homes more expensive, thus prompting consumers to curb their spending. The US central bank has raised interest rates 11 times since March 2022 to their highest level in 22 years.\\n   \\n      Still, the economy seems to have powered through in the third quarter.\\n   \\n      Consumer spending, which accounts for about 70% of economic output, advanced a healthy 0.4% in August, following a 0.7% gain in July. Retail sales, a component of the broader spending figures, grew for the sixth-straight month in September. Meanwhile, industrial production rose in September to its highest level in nearly five years. \\n   \\n      And employers have added about 260,000 jobs a month this year, on average, totaling more than 2 million jobs added since January. A strong job market begets similarly strong spending.\\n   \\n      But to be sure, Americans are still facing several economic obstacles. Soaring Treasury yields are expected to cool the economy, on top of tougher lending standards, the resumption of student-loan repayments, and the exhausted excess savings that many Americans had accumulated during the pandemic. \\n   \\n      The US economy is also contending with two foreign wars, trillions in federal debt, a frozen housing market, and record-low oil inventory, right as geopolitical tensions in the Middle East threaten a spike in oil prices. \\n   \\n      Yet even though uncertainty abounds, some economists maintain a bullish outlook on the economy’s resilience.\\n   \\n      “The rise in bond yields and lags in credit tightening, including effect on corporate debt issued earlier in the pandemic set to reprice at much higher rates, are expected to be headwinds in 2024,” Diane Swonk, chief economist at KPMG, wrote in a post on X, formerly Twitter. \\n   \\n      “That can have a slowdown without fully derailing the economy,” she said.\\n   \\n      From ESG investing (BlackRock) and gay rights (Disney) to Donald Trump after the Capitol riots (mainstream corporate America), companies routinely take a stand on cultural issues. \\n   \\n      Sometimes their stance helps their bottom line, as it did with Nike, after the company supported Colin Kaepernick’s right to kneel during the national anthem in protest against the poor treatment of Black Americans by the police. Sometimes, it does the opposite — think Bud Light’s support of transgender rights, reports my colleague Elliott Gotkine.\\n   \\n      Most companies had avoided wading into the long-running Israeli-Palestinian conflict, but when the barbarous scale of Hamas’s October 7 attacks on Israel became clear, staying silent ceased to be an option, according to some management experts and others in the corporate community.\\n   \\n      “Saying nothing speaks to cowardice,” said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a professor at the Yale School of Management who focuses on corporate leadership among other issues. “They’ll have a hard time celebrating their corporate character and what they stand for if they sit mutely on the sidelines.”\\n   \\n      With that in mind, many companies have rallied in support of Israel. Microsoft (MSFT) CEO Satya Nadella said he was “heartbroken by the horrific terrorist attacks on Israel.” Sundar Pichai, his counterpart at Alphabet (GOOG), was “deeply saddened.” Disney (DIS) donated $2 million in humanitarian relief to Israel, and banks have contributed millions, too. \\n   \\n      All in, around 80 household-name companies in the United States have condemned the Hamas attacks, according to a list compiled by Sonnenfeld.   \\n   \\n      Many organizations, though, have opted for a more cautious approach, especially those outside the United States. In the United Kingdom, London-based football club Tottenham Hotspur, who are known for their large number of Jewish supporters, faced criticism for just saying the club was “\\u200b\\u200bshocked and saddened by the escalating crisis in Israel and Gaza.” \\n   \\nMonday: Earnings from Whirlpool.\\n   \\nTuesday: Earnings from Coca-Cola, Verizon, General Electric, Barclays, 3M, Sherwin-Williams, Kimberly-Clark, General Motors, Haliburton, Spotify, Quest Diagnostics, Microsoft, Alphabet, Visa, and Snap.\\n   \\nWednesday: Earnings from T-Mobile, Boeing, General Dynamics, Moody’s, Hess, Old Dominion, Hilton, Meta, and IBM.

       " {'headline': '\\n      After a summer of Barbenheimer and Beyoncé, can US consumers still afford the holiday season?\\n    ',\n",
       "  'contents': ' \\n      Ballpark attendance boomed this summer, Barbenheimer revived the box office and a Renaissance of live performances brought concerts into new Eras.\\n   \\n      In mid-2023, Americans’ enduring efforts to satisfy post-pandemic cravings for experiences hit a fever pitch.\\n   \\n      “Everybody went out on tour,” said Keith Gentili, a 55-year-old New Hampshire resident who saw 13 shows this summer, a total that surpassed what he’d see in an entire year pre-pandemic. “It was like a buffet. The buffet was open.”\\n   \\n      Consumer spending this year remained strong despite high inflation and rising interest rates. \\n   \\n      But after the summer of splurge, some economists and consumer analysts anticipate that those and other pressures could cause that resilience to buckle — perhaps meaningfully so — during the critical holiday season. \\n   \\n      However, it also could mean that holiday spending just might look a little different and skewed more toward experiences than it has done in past years.\\n   \\n      “I think that, rationally, you would expect there would be some sort of consumer pullback, but then again, we’re seeing so many conflicting signs right now,” said Ted Rossman, senior industry analyst at Bankrate. “We see people spending aggressively on experiences like travel and dining and concerts and sporting events, and that’s not normally what we would see when people get nervous about the state of the economy.”\\n   \\n      He added: “But I think it shows that right now is not a normal time; I think we still have this pent-up demand from the pandemic, and I think a lot of people are saying, ‘You know what? You only live once, and I’m going to do it anyway.’”\\n   \\n      Consumers aren’t expected to pull back entirely this holiday season, and some early surveys indicate that spending will not only be up from last year, but also possibly even higher than levels seen pre-pandemic. \\n   \\n      Respondents to KPMG’s 2023 holiday survey said they plan to spend 5% more this season, said Matt Kramer, KPMG’s consumer and retail national sector leader. \\n   \\n      Discretionary categories such as restaurants, apparel and travel are expected to benefit from people spending less on essentials, which are less expensive because of lower inflation, he said. \\n   \\n      “What stands out the most is this ‘leaning in’ to holiday travel and wanting to have those experiences with friends and family,” he said.\\n   \\n      As broader economic uncertainty grows and consumer sentiment falters, shoppers are expected to be more deal-seeking and price-conscious this season than last year, said Tamara Charm, who heads McKinsey & Company’s consumer insights hub. \\n   \\n      But they’re still going to spend, she said. \\n   \\n      “Our most recent [Consumer Pulse research] measure was that 79% of folks are still trading down,” she said. “And then consumers are also still saying they’re going to splurge, especially higher-income and younger consumers. But the splurge seems to be going to experiences, to travel to out-of-home entertainment, fitness and then also self-care.”\\n   \\n      Consumers closed out the summer with a bang, according to the Commerce Department’s latest retail sales report released earlier this week.\\n   \\n      US retail sales rose 0.7% in September from August, marking the sixth month in a row of growth, according to data that’s adjusted for seasonality but not inflation. \\n   \\n      And in September, that inflation didn’t have an outsized affect on the sales growth, considering the Consumer Price Index for September rose 0.4% on a monthly basis, and goods prices were up only 0.1%.\\n   \\n      However, while the monthly retail sales reports can provide a window into how much Americans’ appetites for goods are growing or waning, they show only part of the consumer spending picture. Aside from sales captured at some restaurants and bars, sales at services-related industries are excluded. \\n   \\n      A more comprehensive look at consumer spending will come at the tail end of the month when the Personal Consumption Expenditures data is released.\\n   \\n      Consumer spending is expected to slow in the coming months but not fizzle out completely, said Gus Faucher, senior vice president and chief economist at the PNC Financial Services Group. \\n   \\n      “There are still some positives: Households still have money saved up, consumer debt burdens are low,” he said, noting that while job growth has slowed considerably from their red-hot pace of the past three years, “it’s still solid job growth.”\\n   \\n      But there’s also plenty of bifurcation occurring in what’s been a post-Covid K-shaped recovery with the wealthiest households having rebounded more strongly than lower-income Americans. \\n   \\n      “Our feeling is that any extra savings that remain are skewed toward upper-income households,” said Nancy Vanden Houten, Oxford Economics’ senior economist. “We think that lower-income households are going to have a harder time maintaining spending.”\\n   \\n      That especially includes Americans who face financial pressures from student loan payments resuming, rising debt, dwindling savings, and high interest rates, she added.\\n   \\n      Additionally, delinquencies are also rising, but are mostly back to pre-pandemic levels; the labor market is slowly becoming less robust; and the geopolitical outlook has grown even more uncertain. \\n   \\n      The growing list of complicating — and potentially culminating — factors are more than mere stumbling blocks to the average American household that has minimal wiggle room in that monthly budget. \\n   \\n      “The economic data has been better than a lot of us expected,” Rossman said. “But I think there are starting to be more and more cracks in the foundation, and that tends to be the most evident among people with lower incomes and lower credit scores.”\\n   \\n      He added: “They’re kind of the canaries in the coal mine.”\\n   \\n      Credit card delinquencies are noticeably worse among people with lower credit scores, he said, noting that subprime auto delinquencies are worse now than they were during the financial crisis of 2007-2009.\\n   \\n      “A lot of folks feel comfortable today, but it wouldn’t necessarily take a whole lot to push them into a situation where they don’t feel all that comfortable,” said Matt Schulz, chief credit analyst with LendingTree. \\n   \\n      For some people, that may be the student loan payment restarting; for others, it may be a job loss or an unexpected medical expense. Every person’s situation is different, but sometimes it doesn’t take much for a comfortable situation to turn dicey, he said. \\n   \\n      “As well as people have generally handled their business over the last couple of years, there comes a point where the headwinds that they face and the challenges that they’re up against become too much,” he said.\\n  ',\n",

       " {'headline': '\\n      Why the housing market is going from tough to terrible\\n    ',\n",
       "  'contents': ' \\n      Mortgage rates are nearing 8%. Prices have climbed for the past three months straight. And there were fewer homes on the market in September than any September ever. No wonder home sales just hit a 13-year low. It is a crummy time to try to buy a house.\\n   \\n      In unwelcome news to homebuyers, none of this is expected to change soon. Prices are expected to stay high, inventory is expected to stay low and rates may climb even further.\\n   \\n      The current housing market offers a crushing affordability picture for would-be-homebuyers and is keeping many out of the market. And it has been steadily worsening for the past two years.\\n   \\n      With the average 30-year fixed rate loan currently at 7.63%, according to Freddie Mac, it now requires a monthly principal and interest payment of $2,528 to afford a median-priced home with a 20% down payment, according to ICE Mortgage Technology, which recently acquired mortgage data provider Black Knight. \\n   \\n      That is up 91% from two years ago and an increase of $1,204 a month, ICE found.\\n   \\n      The monthly payment on an average-priced home now requires 40% of the median household income, making housing the least affordable it’s been since 1984, according to ICE.\\n   \\n      “The last time home affordability was this tight, interest rates were at 13.6% — roughly 6 points higher than today — and the average home price was about 3.5 times the median household income,” said Andy Walden, vice president of enterprise research at ICE Mortgage Technology. “Today, after years of low interest rates helping to drive purchase prices up, the average home costs six times the median income.”\\n   \\n      To bring affordability back to long-term averages, he said, it would take some combination of up to a 37% decline in home prices, mortgage rates dropping by 4 percentage points, or a 60% growth in median household incomes. \\n   \\n      “Unfortunately, the upward shift in Treasury yields this week will likely make returning to ‘normal’ an even more challenging target to hit,” Walden said.\\n   \\n      Inflation is still above the Fed’s stated target of 2%, which means the central bank’s benchmark rate will likely stay higher for longer.\\n   \\n      Ahead of the central bank’s upcoming two-day policy meeting, which starts on October 31, financial markets are pricing in another pause on rate hikes. But the chances of an additional pause in December are much lower, at around 61%, according to the CME FedWatch Tool.\\n   \\n      “Longer term Treasury yields — which mortgage rates tend to follow — depend on expected economic growth and inflation expectations,” said Orphe Divounguy, senior economist at Zillow. “Inflation expectations are moving higher. Political dysfunction in the nation’s capital and rising government borrowing are also likely contributing to the increased pressure on yields.” \\n   \\n      But even if mortgage rates do reach 8%, it wouldn’t make things that much worse for buyers, said Nicole Bachaud, senior economist at Zillow, partly because the market is already so unaffordable.\\n   \\n      A buyer making the median household income and putting a 10% down payment on a typical home in August would have spent almost 40% of their income on their mortgage payments. To get that down to the recommended 30%, which is a standard threshold commonly used as a guideline for an affordable home, a household would need an annual income of almost $107,000, according to Zillow. The median household income was $74,580 in 2022, according to the US Census Bureau.\\n   \\n      If mortgage rates rise to 8%, Bachaud said, the income needed to afford the typical US home would rise to nearly $114,000. \\n   \\n      “Buyers are already in a tight spot and the housing market isn’t likely to look markedly different with rates above 8%,” she said.\\n   \\n      But with a strong labor market and Fed rate cuts pushed out into, perhaps, the third quarter of 2024, the market could stay at this level for a while, said John Toohig, head of whole loan trading at Raymond James.\\n   \\n      So how long can home prices stay strong? And how much longer can would-be homeowners keep putting off buying a home?\\n   \\n      “For much of this year I’ve hunted for good news as to how we will endure ‘higher for longer’ but not see the world break,” Toohig said. \\n   \\n      “An aggressive Fed that is prone to overcorrecting can do real damage,” he said. “Good news in the economy causes rates to stay higher for longer — but the longer rates are higher, the more likely something in the market goes ‘boom.’”\\n  ',\n",

       " {'headline': '\\n      Why this American couple swapped California for Spain\\n    ',\n",
       "  'contents': ' \\n      After a number of failed IVF rounds, health issues and the death of their beloved dog, US couple Jason Luban and Selena Medlen were in need of a change of scenery.\\n   \\n      The couple, then based in Oakland, California, had penciled in a trip to Andalusia, Spain, months before, but were unsure whether to go ahead with it when the health of Luban, who has torsion dystonia, a rare movement disorder, began to deteriorate.\\n   \\n      “We were figuring out how to get him healthy again,” Medlen tells CNN Travel, before explaining that Luban was also grieving the loss of a friend and mentor. “So we had this vacation on the books, and we weren’t sure if he could travel.”\\n   \\n      According to Medlen, they ultimately decided to “go for it” after Luban, who suffers from insomnia, began sleeping better.\\n   \\n      “We thought, maybe we needed a break,” adds Medlen, who was working as an attorney at the time. “That if we could get away from everything, maybe he would start to feel better.”\\n   \\n      A friend had recommended that the pair, married since 2009, spend some time in Ronda, a town located in Spain’s Malaga province, so they decided to book two nights there.\\n   \\n      But neither could have predicted that they’d end up packing up their lives and relocating there just a few months later.\\n   \\n      In May 2016, they flew into Madrid, spending some time in the capital city, as well as Toledo, Cordoba and Seville, before heading to Ronda.\\n   \\n      “As we left Seville for Ronda, something shifted,” says Luban, an acupuncturist. “The land. The energy. “All [of] the plants were blooming.\\n   \\n      “There were all these colors everywhere. And we were both just in shock at how gorgeous it was as we kept climbing and climbing in the car.”\\n   \\n      When they reached the town, they were greeted by a parade, which set the tone for the rest of the weekend.\\n   \\n      The pair celebrated Medlen’s 38th birthday in Ronda, and say they were struck by how friendly everyone was.\\n   \\n      “Everything kind of came together for just a day or two while we were here,” says Luban, who is originally from Oregon while Medlen is from Texas.\\n   \\n      After wrapping up their time in the pretty town, they went on to visit Granada before returning to the US. But Ronda stayed with them.\\n   \\n      “We went back to our lives, which we realized really sucked compared to what our experience was here [in Ronda,]” admits Luban, before explaining that his insomnia returned once they were back in the US.\\n   \\n      “Also, we both had, unbeknownst to one another, looked in the windows of real estate offices to see what the rental prices were here [in Ronda]. And it was a tenth of what we were paying in California.”\\n   \\n      While lying on the couch one day and reflecting on their fertility struggles, they began discussing what they would want for their lives if they weren’t ever able to have children.\\n   \\n      “Selena said, ‘If we’re not going to have a kid, I want my life to be f**king fabulous,’” recalls Luban. “And we were like, ‘Okay, what does that look like?’”\\n   \\n      They decided that, for them, this would be having the opportunity to live in another country, experience a different culture and learn the language.\\n   \\n      And Spain was now right at the top of their list.\\n   \\n      After sitting down and working out the figures, the couple realized that it would be “affordable” for them to live in Ronda for a year, provided Luban sold his acupuncture practice in California, which he managed to do within six weeks.\\n   \\n      They then whittled down all of their belongings “from two cars and a full house to two suitcases a piece,” and booked an Airbnb in Ronda to stay in before they found something more long-term.\\n   \\n      The pair flew back to Madrid in September 2016.\\n   \\n      “Four months after we left Ronda, we were back to stay,” says Luban. “For what we thought would be a year.”\\n   \\n      But while the town had seemed like a magical place when they’d visited a few months before, it looked far less appealing when they returned shortly after Feria de Pedro Romero, a festival dedicated to bullfighting.\\n   \\n      “We arrived on a Sunday, so it was after the party,” explains Medlen. “Everything was closed.\\n   \\n      “The town was kind of dead and they had not had the opportunity to clean up [from the festival] yet. So it was a really different experience.”\\n   \\n      Luban jokes that they found themselves walking down the road with their suitcases thinking, “Oh my God, what did we do to our lives?”\\n   \\n      Although they’d previously been told that they’d have plenty of options for long-term rentals once they were in Ronda, this turned out not to be the case, and they struggled to find somewhere suitable at first.\\n   \\n      The prices were also slightly higher than they’d estimated, although still more affordable than what they’d been paying in California.\\n   \\n      Despite these initial setbacks, the couple persevered and soon found an apartment. They went on to join a language school in order to learn Spanish, and say that this proved to be a massive turning point for them.\\n   \\n      “It’s probably the reason we stayed,” admits Medlen. “Because it was such a great place for forming community.”\\n   \\n      They began going to various classes four times a week, and were able to meet other expats and discuss their experiences with them, which helped them through the process tremendously.\\n   \\n      “Nobody in the US could relate to what we were doing,” explains Luban. “They all thought it was a great idea until we were going to do it. Then they were like, ‘What are you doing?’”\\n   \\n      As Luban has dual US-German citizenship, he didn’t need a visa to live in Spain. However, Medlen was required to obtain a residence permit.\\n   \\n      While they adapted to the Spanish lifestyle quickly, there were some aspects that they found difficult to get used to.\\n   \\n      “I think we struggled with the siesta concept,” admits Medlen. “We’d be gung-ho to get a bunch of things done, and we’d run into town to do those mundane tasks that we all have to do.\\n   \\n      “But everything’s closed between two and five. So you pretty much can’t do anything.”\\n   \\n      The pair admit that it took them some time to transition from being around expats constantly, to integrating within the Spanish community, and say that this is something that they’re still navigating.\\n   \\n      However, Luban emotionally recalls how the importance of this connection really hit home when he ended up in hospital after a bike accident last year and underwent emergency surgery.\\n   \\n      “It would have been a completely different and much less pleasant experience if we didn’t know people who happen to be nurses and knew the whole community,” Luban explains.\\n   \\n      “Whereas when we first got here, we weren’t part of that community. But we thought we were having our Spain experience with expats.”\\n   \\n      While the couple have private medical insurance, Luban was initially admitted to a public hospital, which wasn’t covered under their policy.\\n   \\n      “Being Americans, we thought, ‘This could ruin us. There goes Spain.’” admits Luban. “The next day, when I was released after I’d had surgery, a night there, my own room and two ambulance rides. They said, ‘Well, we need you to pay the bill. It’s 1,380 euros.’”\\n   \\n      He was particularly moved by the kindness shown by the local community, who dropped off food and constantly checked up on both of them.\\n   \\n      “In America, people would text you gift certificates and sad faces on the phone,” says Luban.\\n   \\n      “Here, people literally showed up at the door when Selena would be coming back from the hospital to give her a hug and tell her that they were going to be there. And they were there. For weeks.”\\n   \\n      While they’d initially planned to stay in Spain for a year, Luban and Medlen chose to extend their stay beyond this.\\n   \\n      The couple admit that watching Donald Trump being elected as president of the United States in November 2016 contributed to their decision to remain in Spain.\\n   \\n      “Once that happened, within a couple of months, our families were saying, ‘Don’t come back,’” says Luban, explaining that their relatives had been eager for them to return before the election result.\\n   \\n      “‘This country is changing. You really should just enjoy yourselves and not get caught up in all of the division that’s happening in the United States.’ That was just two months in.”\\n   \\n      Medlen points out that they both worked constantly while they were in the US, and felt as though they rarely got to spend time together, whereas they’ve been able to enjoy each other’s company a great deal more while living in Spain.\\n   \\n      Meanwhile, Luban’s health has improved during their time there, and he regularly rides with various local cycling groups. However, he says that he’s had his ups and downs “sleep-wise.”\\n   \\n      “The biggest thing is that we can manage our stress much better here,” he says. “When we’re not constantly worrying about our safety, money or whatever.”\\n   \\n      As they only had enough funds to cover a year living in Spain without working, the couple needed to start earning money again in order to extend their time there.\\n   \\n      Fortunately, Medlen was able to take on remote work for law firms in the US and Luban launched a website advising other practitioners on how to sell a medical practice.\\n   \\n      “I’d say we spend one fifth of what we would on food here, rather than California,” Luban estimates. “One eighth to one tenth on our living expenses. One eighth on health care.\\n   \\n      “And we had no idea how much your quality of life goes up when you’re not trying to meet all of those bills.”\\n   \\n      They both try to work around 20 hours a week, and say they’ve been able to live comfortably this way because their money goes much further in Spain.\\n   \\n      “We also have more time to cook, which brings your food bills down because you’re not buying takeout,” adds Medlen. “And we have more time to exercise. So I feel like we’re healthier.”\\n   \\n      Seven years after relocating to Ronda, the couple are very much settled, and even have a dog, named Lola Supernova.\\n   \\n      They say that they re-evaluate their decision each year, and weigh up whether they want to stay in Spain or move on.\\n   \\n      However, they’ve chosen not to buy a home there so that they have a little more freedom.\\n   \\n      “Wa take it to one year increments,” explains Medlen. “And we still rent our apartment that we live in.\\n   \\n      “We want to keep things simple and have flexibility so that we could change our minds and go somewhere else.”\\n   \\n      They return to the US every year and joke that they’re always shocked by how much a burrito at American food chain Chipotle is.\\n   \\n      “There’s been a lot of inflation since we left,” notes Medlen.\\n   \\n      While the couple still sometimes struggle with the prospect of not having children, Luban, now 53, says they feel “too old now,” adding that while they previously looked into adoption “the process seemed to be a nightmare, financially and otherwise.”\\n   \\n      “And it was such an emotionally (and financially) painful experience to try and fail, we couldn’t go through it again,” he adds, stressing that they have “no regrets.”\\n   \\n      “So we decided instead that we’d make our lives as interesting as possible.”\\n   \\n      Both acknowledge that one of the downsides of living in a different country for so long is that they don’t necessarily feel they belong anywhere.\\n   \\n      “We may never feel entirely at home in the US again, and we will never be truly accepted as Spanish,” admits Luban, noting that a “great way to learn about your country is to leave it.”\\n   \\n      “But Andalusia has taken us in, cared for us in a way we never could have imagined. Like interest on a bank account we never knew we had.”\\n  ',\n",

       "  'contents': ' \\n      Mandy Sanchez was sitting in her bedroom in Texas when she saw the listing.\\n   \\n      A spacious room in an Art Nouveau building in the buzzy Vinohrady neighborhood, near the city’s Riegrovy Sady park, known for its beautiful sunsets.\\n   \\n      It was December 2019. Mandy was a 22-year-old about to graduate Texas A&M University. She was planning to move to Prague to teach English.\\n   \\n      She’d joined a Facebook group called “Flatshare in Prague”, hoping to find somewhere to live. The Vinohrady room was advertised by a Facebook user called Marcus Wecksten. Alongside photos of the apartment, Marcus wrote that the current inhabitants were two guys – one Finnish (Marcus) and one German (his roommate, Boris). Marcus and Boris were both students in Prague and were looking for someone to move in ASAP.\\n   \\n      Mandy thought the apartment looked perfect: great neighborhood, nice-looking space – and the room was within her budget. It was almost too good to be true. She fired off a message right away, expressing her interest.\\n   \\n      Marcus was studying in his bedroom in the Prague apartment when Mandy’s message popped up on his laptop.\\n   \\n      “Sounds great,” he said. “Can you come by sometime next week for a viewing?”\\n   \\n      “I’m in Texas,” explained Mandy. “I’m moving to Prague in January.”\\n   \\n      Marcus considered this. They wouldn’t be able to meet Mandy before she signed the lease, which wasn’t ideal. He wrote back to Mandy, apologizing, explaining it wouldn’t work out.\\n   \\n      But Mandy was determined. “We could Skype?” she suggested. “I really want this room.”\\n   \\n      Marcus – who, back then, was 25 and midway through a medical degree at Prague’s Charles University – had met his roommate Boris at college. The two had lived in the Vinohrady apartment for a couple of years.\\n   \\n      “It was a super-nice apartment in one of the coolest neighborhoods in Prague,” Marcus tells CNN Travel.\\n \\n      A revolving door of fellow students had rented the third room over the years.\\n   \\n      “We were looking for somebody social, who wanted to hang out with us in the communal space, in the living room – that’s where we spent quite a bit of time,” Marcus recalls. “I don’t know what the other requirements were, but probably the basic ones – somebody clean…”\\n   \\n      In the subsequent Skype interview, Mandy recalls Boris being particularly concerned about her potential cleanliness.\\n   \\n      “He asked a lot about if I would help out with the cleaning,” she says. “But I was the one who was more worried about, ‘Are they going to be clean?’ Because it’s two guys…”\\n   \\n      Shared standards of cleanliness confirmed, Mandy, Marcus and Boris spent much of the Skype call talking about the Vinohrady neighborhood and the nearby amenities. Towards the end, they segued into chatting about themselves.\\n   \\n      “I thought that it was super-interesting that Mandy was from Texas,” says Marcus. “I had never met a Texan in my life. I had this stereotypical picture of a Texan in a cowboy hat and boots and a revolver.”\\n   \\n      For her part, Mandy hung up the call with the impression Marcus and Boris were friendly and “normal.”\\n   \\n      “I hung up and basically was like, ‘Okay, they’re not going to murder me. They seem like nice people. I probably could enter their apartment and we would be okay.’”\\n   \\n      After a follow-up call to iron out details, Marcus and Boris offered Mandy the room. By coincidence, this message arrived on the day of Mandy’s college graduation.\\n   \\n      Midway through celebrating her graduation, Mandy filled in her parents and sister on her new home. She extolled its virtues – amazing location, great-looking building, and mentioned in passing that the roommates were two guys who were medical students.\\n   \\n      “My parents were like, ‘We hope you don’t fall in love with either of them, because if you do, that means you’re going to live in Europe forever,’” Mandy recalls.\\n   \\n      “I was like, ‘Why would that be the case?’ And they said, ‘Well, because they’re going to be getting medically licensed in Europe, and then that’s not going to transfer easily to the US. So, if you fall in love with one of them, you’re staying there forever.’”\\n   \\n      Her parents were speaking in jest – at least in part. But Mandy cut through their teasing tone, wanting to set the record straight.\\n   \\n      “That is not what I’m going to Europe for,” she said.\\n   \\n      And it was true.\\n   \\n      “I wasn’t moving there to fall in love,” says Mandy today.\\n   \\n      But the universe had other ideas.\\n   \\n      Mandy had never been to Prague before. She’d scrolled through photos online and marveled at how beautiful it looked. She’d got tips from friends who’d visited and fallen in love with the city. She’d started to imagine herself living in the apartment in Vinohrady.\\n   \\n      But none of this could prepare her for the whirlwind of her arrival day.\\n   \\n      “I don’t really think I was thinking – it was just all happening,” Mandy recalls.\\n   \\n      She remembers getting into an Uber at the airport and peering out the window. It was only 5:30 p.m., but it was already pitch black outside. As she got closer to the city, the spires of Prague Castle were illuminated. Mandy felt a mixture of exhaustion, excitement and disbelief that this new stage of her life had started.\\n   \\n      Meanwhile, Marcus and Boris had spent most of that day deep-cleaning their apartment.\\n   \\n      “We were cleaning corners of the apartment that hadn’t been cleaned in a long time,” says Marcus. “We wanted to make a good impression on Mandy.”\\n   \\n      Marcus had just taken out the last trash bag and dumped it in the communal bins when Mandy’s Uber pulled up in front of the building.\\n   \\n      “She gets out, the driver helped her with her bags,” Marcus recalls. “My first impression is that she’s super-cute. She’s tiny, but she seems to have a lot of energy and she’s very cute.”\\n   \\n      Mandy smiled as the Uber drove away.\\n   \\n      “Oh, you must be Marcus,” she said.\\n   \\n      Marcus reached out his hand for Mandy to shake. The moment was a little awkward, but friendly.\\n   \\n      Then, Marcus took Mandy’s bags and carried them up the stairs.\\n   \\n      “I was like, ‘Oh, that’s very nice that he took my bags. Duly noted,’” recalls Mandy.\\n   \\n      Inside the new apartment, Mandy met Boris and offered to treat her new roommates to take-out.\\n   \\n      The next thing she knew, Marcus was putting through a pizza order on his laptop.\\n   \\n      “I had to awkwardly hand him my credit card,” says Mandy “He’s typing in the details. And then, Google Chrome asks if he wants to save the card. And I was like, ‘You better not save that card information.’”\\n   \\n      Mandy was only half-joking. She recalls thinking: “This is kind of weird. I just met this guy. And I’m giving him my credit card information.”\\n   \\n      For the next couple of hours, Mandy, Marcus and Boris sat around eating pizza and chatting.\\n   \\n      Mandy appreciated how welcoming her new roommates were. And she thought Marcus was “cute.”\\n   \\n      “But also I was tired,” she says. “I was like, ‘Maybe I’m delusional.’”\\n   \\n      After dinner, Mandy, exhausted from the flight, decamped to her bedroom and went to sleep. She woke up wondering if she’d still find Marcus attractive after sleeping off the jet lag. Her question was answered as soon as she saw him in the kitchen, smiling at her.\\n   \\n      Over the next week, Mandy and Marcus got to know each other. They ate dinner out most nights – just the two of them. Boris was always invited, but often had plans and couldn’t join.\\n   \\n      Mandy says she and Marcus “clicked right away.”\\n   \\n      “There was a lot of chemistry between us. But it was chemistry that you’re not sure what you should do with,” she says.\\n   \\n      Mandy was conscious they’d just moved in together – she didn’t want to halt a potential friendship or upset their living situation.\\n   \\n      But Marcus didn’t quite have the same reservations about potentially dating his roommate.\\n   \\n      “I was probably more riding the wave of what was happening,” he says. “I didn’t really think about the potential consequences so much, I was more like, ‘Feels good. Let’s go for it.’”\\n   \\n      Despite Mandy’s hesitations, she and Marcus grew closer and closer. Mandy couldn’t deny what she calls “the immediacy of the draw we had to each other.”\\n   \\n      Before long, they were dating in all but name. They went out to dinner together, explored Prague side by side, and spent hours talking together in the apartment. They traveled out of Prague to the Pilsner Brewery together, enjoying a tour and spending the evening sharing beers. On Valentine’s Day, around a month after she’d moved in, Marcus cooked for Mandy. Boris walked in and raised an eyebrow at the obvious romantic undertones.\\n   \\n      But all the while Mandy and Marcus grew closer, the shadow of coronavirus was becoming harder to ignore. When Mandy arrived in Europe, the pandemic was a distant rumbling of thunder. By early March, the storm had broken over Europe.\\n   \\n      Mandy woke up one morning to an email from her parents. The US border was closing. They’d bought her a plane ticket home.\\n   \\n      “Here’s your plane ticket, it leaves on Thursday, and we have 24 hours to cancel it. So it’s fully refundable,” read the email. “You’re an adult, you can make your own decisions. But we would really like you to come home.”\\n   \\n      Mandy wasn’t sure what to do. If she left, her visa would be nulled and it wouldn’t be easy for her to come back. Her burgeoning connection with Marcus would end before it had even begun.\\n   \\n      But on the flip side, this was a global crisis. Surely it made sense to be with her loved ones in her home country? If she stayed, would she be stuck in Prague indefinitely?\\n   \\n      “I think I’m falling in love,” Mandy thought. “I don’t want this to end. But I also don’t know if this is a mistake not to go home.”\\n   \\n      Boris had already returned to Germany. But Marcus wasn’t sure if he would go back to Finland. He hadn’t spoken the words aloud, but it seemed like he was waiting to see what Mandy would do.\\n   \\n      Over the next 24 hours Mandy flip-flopped between staying and going. Eventually, she and Marcus talked through their options together.\\n   \\n      “We didn’t go out and say, ‘Hey, we will fight through this Covid together, united,’” says Marcus. “It was more carefully trying to pique each other’s interest.”\\n   \\n      “If you stay, I’ll stay,” Mandy and Marcus eventually decided.\\n   \\n      “Once we had decided that we would both stay, it felt very exciting for me,” says Marcus.\\n   \\n      Over the next few months, as Prague descended into a strict lockdown, Mandy and Marcus were together pretty much 24/7.\\n   \\n      Marcus started experimenting with cooking elaborate meals. Mandy would sit on the couch, drinking wine, cheering him on and keeping him company.\\n   \\n      The two spent long evenings sharing stories and talking about their lives.\\n   \\n      “We grew much closer and developed much stronger feelings for each other,” says Marcus. “We spent so much time together, just the two of us and got to open up about stuff.”\\n   \\n      For Marcus, the more introverted of the pair, spending time with Mandy at home was the ideal way to get to know her properly.\\n   \\n      “I felt quite comfortable and safe in that home environment,” he says. “So I felt like I could be myself. And also with Mandy – just her personality meant it was very easy to be myself.”\\n   \\n      Mandy found it harder to be in the moment. She loved spending time with Marcus, but she couldn’t help but worry about the potential future complications of dating someone from a different country.\\n   \\n      She also struggled not to let the grim realities of the pandemic infiltrate their bubble.\\n   \\n      “Everything was still quite up in the air,” she recalls. “We hadn’t defined the relationship, but I stayed for this man, basically. And I’ve just moved here, and I’m still under a visa process that’s ongoing, and the world is up in flames and all of these things…So it wasn’t necessarily like, ‘Oh, I feel safe and at home with you.’ It was pretty hectic for me still.”\\n   \\n      Despite this, Mandy recalls many bright spots.\\n   \\n      “We spent a lot of time in the park, drinking prosecco and having a grand old time,” she says.\\n   \\n      Prague, usually packed with tourists, was sleepy and empty.\\n   \\n      Mandy and Marcus recall “walking on the Charles Bridge, and absolutely no one was there.”\\n   \\n      Despite the grim circumstances, the empty city “was pretty cool.”\\n   \\n      Summer rolled around, Prague’s pandemic restrictions eased a little. Marcus was set to head back to Finland for his summer vacation to work. He was set to be away from the Czech Republic for three months.\\n   \\n      “The night before he left, I’m crying and I’m like, ‘Oh, gosh, you’re leaving and I’m so sad,’” recalls Mandy.\\n   \\n      That was the moment Mandy and Marcus finally spoke their feelings aloud – and confirmed they were committed to being together.\\n   \\n      During their three months apart, Mandy and Marcus only grew more certain of this fact. Mandy recalls phoning her mother, telling her she knew she was in love with Marcus and she hoped he felt the same way.\\n   \\n      When Marcus returned to the apartment in Vinohrady, he told Mandy he was in love with her.\\n   \\n      “Thank goodness,” said Mandy, laughing.\\n   \\n      It was then that she finally let herself relax into this new reality. Marcus was her boyfriend, and despite the stresses that defined 2020, Mandy was happy. She loved living in Prague. She decided to extend her time there, using the pandemic as an excuse – pretty much all her teaching had taken place online, after all, she hadn’t really had the experience she’d planned.\\n   \\n      Whenever she was asked, Mandy was vague about how much longer she’d stay.\\n   \\n      “It was always, ‘A while longer,’” says Mandy. “Never really a defined end.”\\n   \\n      Boris returned to Prague, bemused by how Marcus and Mandy’s relationship had grown in his absence. He was happy for them.\\n   \\n      “I left Mandy and Marcus as two new roommates and met them again when I came back as a well established couple with their own traditions and habits,” Boris tells CNN Travel. “It was a very cute situation to witness.”\\n   \\n      The following summer, in July 2021, Mandy traveled with Marcus to Finland to spend time with his friends and family and get a glimpse into his culture and country.\\n   \\n      “Introducing Mandy to my friends felt really great,” recalls Marcus. “She seemed to click with everyone.”\\n   \\n      “Meeting his family and coming to Finland was that final puzzle piece for me,” says Mandy.\\n   \\n      When the US borders reopened later that year, Marcus traveled with Mandy to Texas to meet Mandy’s loved ones.\\n   \\n      “Her parents and sister, they were all super-embracing and I really felt like I was part of the family from the get-go,” says Marcus.\\n   \\n      After those important introductions, “we felt it was getting more serious,” says Mandy.\\n   \\n      But Mandy and Marcus’ future still felt like it came with a lot of question marks. If they stayed together, where would they live? Mandy’s parents’ initial tongue-in-cheek comments about marrying her medical student roommates still stood – Marcus wouldn’t be able to practice medicine in the US, so living there seemed out of the question.\\n   \\n      During this time, Marcus and Mandy decided to go to couples therapy, figuring it was important to talk through some of these uncertainties.\\n   \\n      “I think that was really helpful for us in terms of – there’s so many things to think about with an intercultural relationship – where we’re going to live and all of these really heavy questions,” says Mandy.\\n   \\n      “We had a really great therapist in Prague, and that really helped us to feel a lot more serious and have a very solid foundation.”\\n   \\n      The couple confirmed they “saw life together” and decided it was OK to just “try to figure it out step by step.”\\n   \\n      “We feel very secure,” says Marcus. “We know that it’s going to be the two of us going forward.”\\n   \\n      Cut to spring 2023, three years since Mandy moved to Prague, and three years since she met Marcus.\\n   \\n      The couple were starting to suspect they’d have to leave the city they both loved. Marcus was about to graduate medical school, and it was looking like it would be easier for him to get a job in Finland.\\n   \\n      To mark three years together, Marcus decided to surprise Mandy with a photoshoot – he figured they’d both appreciate having some nice photos at some of their favorite Prague spots.\\n   \\n      The couple, photographer in tow, headed to a park where the trees were covered in pastel-colored blossoms. Mandy had long been obsessed with the blooming spring trees, she’d never seen anything like them in Texas.\\n   \\n      As the photographer took a couple of preliminary photographs of Mandy, Marcus seized the moment. He knelt behind her. When Mandy turned around, she was initially confused. Then it twigged – he was proposing.\\n   \\n      The subsequent photos captured Mandy’s pure delight. In fact, in all the photos taken that day, Mandy and Marcus are glowing with happiness.\\n   \\n      The shoot concluded on the Charles Bridge. As Mandy and Marcus stood there, looking out over the city arm in arm, Mandy suggested they should celebrate at their favorite restaurant.\\n   \\n      “Well, it depends on how long it takes you to pack,” said Marcus.\\n   \\n      “He’d planned a night or two at a spa hotel in Karlovy Vary, which is a spa town two hours outside of Prague,” explains Mandy.\\n   \\n      The couple spent the rest of the weekend toasting their future.\\n   \\n      This past summer, Marcus and Mandy left Prague and moved to Helsinki, Finland. It was bittersweet saying goodbye to the city that shaped their relationship, but the couple are excited for this next chapter, and plan to stay in Helsinki for the next couple of years.\\n   \\n      Mandy and Marcus will return to Prague next spring for their wedding – a weekend celebration in which friends and family from across the globe, including, of course, their former roommate Boris, will convene in the Czech Republic to celebrate Mandy and Marcus’ love story.\\n   \\n      On their wedding website, Marcus and Mandy listed some of their favorite places in Prague for guests unfamiliar with the city. They eschewed the obvious spots – they’re available for anyone to Google – in favor of the local haunts they loved. Naturally, the Vinohrady apartment is top of that list.\\n   \\n      Marcus and Mandy look back at their time there very fondly. Marcus marvels at the “small, tiny events” that lead them to cross paths, live in that apartment together and fall in love.\\n   \\n      Mandy expresses “how absolutely joyful, smitten, and thankful we are that we allowed ourselves the joy of loving each other – even when we weren’t sure how things would turn out.”\\n   \\n      “We’ve experienced quite a bit in these few years together and are so happy that we get to continue going through life together,” Mandy says. “It’s been the greatest and most unexpected adventure.”\\n  ',\n",

       " {'headline': '\\n      Thousands flock to Trinity Site for the first time since ‘Oppenheimer’s’ release\\n    ',\n",
       "  'contents': ' \\n“Oppenheimer” may have given the Trinity Site a boost of fame this summer, but for many history buffs, making a pilgrimage to the area is a journey years in the making.\\n   \\n      Nearly 4,000 people flocked to the Trinity Site this past Saturday, according to the White Sand Missile Range Public Affairs Office, waiting hours to visit the infamous ground zero, where the first atomic bomb was detonated.\\n   \\n      David Tise, a 33-year-old National Park Service Ranger at Carlsbad Caverns in New Mexico and a self-described “historical nutcase,” took Friday off work to make the 2.5-hour drive to Alamogordo, New Mexico. He then woke up at 5:30 a.m. and made the two-hour drive to the site, where he then waited in line for about 90 minutes. In total, that’s about six hours — all just to see the Trinity Site, a goal he’s had for years.\\n   \\n      “The thing that stood out the most was how isolated it was,” Tise told CNN. “Even back then, how they transported everything for the test from Los Alamos without anyone noticing.”\\n   \\n      The Trinity Site only opens to the public twice a year, on the first Saturday in April and the third Saturday in October, said Drew Hamilton, a spokesperson with the White Sand Missile Range Public Affairs Office.\\n   \\n      Because of the success of the “Oppenheimer” movie, which tells the story of J. Robert Oppenheimer and the Manhattan Project, staff were expecting closer to 5,000 visitors this year, Hamilton said. Still, 4,000 is “on the higher end,” he said, a trend he expects to continue for next year’s April opening.\\n   \\n      Tise, who completed his first visit this year, called the experience “sobering.”\\n   \\n      “The Trinity test helped win World War II and saved countless American lives. However, the area is still a little radioactive and the test destroyed the environment for years after,” he said. “I’m not a warmonger or anything but I don’t think anyone should have that much power to destroy the world.”\\n   \\n      Zach Berkowitz, an 18-year-old high school student from Colorado, also had a long journey to see the site. Berkowitz and his father woke up at 5:15 a.m. on Saturday and drove an hour from their hotel to the Trinity Site, where they then waited almost two hours just to enter.\\n   \\n      Berkowitz is interested in nuclear history and has wanted to see the site for years, he said. But his dad needed convincing — only agreeing to do the drive after seeing “Oppenheimer.”\\n   \\n      “Seeing the pieces of trinitite on the ground was really interesting, since it really made it clear that I was standing somewhere special,” Berkowtiz said.\\n   \\n      Trinitite, the glass-like chunks that appeared on the desert floor following the Trinity explosion, are illegal to collect due to concerns of radioactivity. Based on what other people’s Geiger counters detected, the trinitite was more radioactive than Berkowitz had expected, he said. He tried to pick one up, but was told not to by an Army member.\\n   \\n      “If I could have taken a piece home, I would have,” he said. “But doing so is illegal.”\\n   \\n      Though this year’s opening doesn’t quite beat the record for visitors – that would be 2015’s 70th anniversary, for which more than 5,000 people made the trek — this year’s event still attracted the usual “wide array of visitors,” Hamilton said, “from those who just happened to be stopping by to those that had planned entire vacations around making it out.”\\n   \\n      “Everybody that’s there is excited to be there, just because we don’t open the site up so often, so it is kind of a treat,” he said. “And the majority of visitors are history buffs anyway. So getting out and being able to go to a site that isn’t open very often, and is such a significant historical point on the globe, is a real fun thing for them.”\\n  ',\n",

       "  'contents': ' \\n      Cambodia’s newest and biggest airport opened to commercial operations in the province of Siem Reap in the country’s northwest this week.\\n   \\n      The China-funded Siem Reap-Angkor International Airport is now the main gateway to one of the country’s most popular tourist sites, the UNESCO-listed Angkor Archaeological Complex.\\n   \\n      On Monday morning, a flight operated by Thailand’s Bangkok Airways was the first to land at the new airport, which is located about 40 kilometers (25 miles) away from the protected area.\\n   \\n      Using the International Air Transport Association-designated code SAI, it replaces Siem Reap International Airport (REP), which first opened in 1932 and is only a few kilometers away from the Angkor complex.\\n   \\n      The new airport, funded by China as part of its\\xa0Belt\\xa0and\\xa0Road Initiative at a cost of about $1.1 billion, was designed to initially handle 7 million passengers a year – 2 million more than REP – and has a 3,600-meter-long runway.\\n   \\n      According to the Economic and Commercial Office of the Chinese Embassy in Cambodia, it’s the first overseas international airport to be constructed under a “Build-Operate-Transfer” model by Chinese enterprises and is operated and managed by the Yunnan Aviation Industry Investment Group. Designated a “4E\\xa0airport,” it can accommodate larger commercial planes, including many of those used on global long-haul routes.\\n   \\n      Construction began in 2020, with the airport design reportedly inspired by the traditional Cambodian architecture style. The official airport website offers minimal information on available services, shops and restaurants at the new facility, however, it does provide a full schedule of departing and arriving flights.\\n   \\n      Recent data released by Cambodia’s Ministry of Tourism reveals the country received 3.5 million international tourists in the first eight months of 2023.\\n   \\n      That’s an increase of 250.8% over the same period last year, but a decrease of 19.7% over 2019, before the country closed its borders because of the pandemic. Cambodia relaxed its Covid entry restrictions and reopened to tourists in March 2022. The country is on track to receive approximately 4.5 to five million international tourists by the end of this year, says the ministry.\\n   \\n      Many of those visitors head to Siem Reap to experience the Angkor complex,\\xa0which is one of the most important archaeological sites in Southeast Asia, according to the UNESCO inscription.\\n   \\n      Stretching over 400 square kilometers, the park contains the remains of the different capitals of the Khmer Empire, from the 9th to the 15th century. But only a handful of its sites – namely Angkor Wat, Angkor Thom and the Bayon – receive the bulk of tourist traffic.\\n  ',\n",

       "  'contents': ' \\n      Ruben Flowers stumbled across the photo by accident.\\n   \\n      It was early 2023 and he was thumbing through photo albums at his grandmother’s house. Suddenly, there it was: a snapshot from 1994, taken in an airplane flight deck, depicting him as a toddler, sitting next to his pilot dad.\\n   \\n      In this picture, Flowers is looking at his dad in admiration. His father smiles at the camera, ready to fly the plane.\\n   \\n      Flowers had forgotten the photo existed, but seeing it again, he was flooded with memories of growing up, inspired by his father. He’d loved their trips to the airport, tagging along to the training center, taking a go on the simulators. He’d beamed with pride when his dad talked about his job at the school careers day.\\n   \\n      And the timing of the rediscovered photo was perfect: Flowers, now 30, was just about to follow in his father’s footsteps and begin flying as a First Officer for Southwest Airlines.\\n   \\n      Meanwhile Flowers’ father – also called Ruben Flowers – was nearing retirement and readying for his final Southwest flight as Captain.\\n   \\n      The two men were excited to briefly overlap at Southwest and hoped they’d get an opportunity to fly together.\\n   \\n      “It was a dream of mine to make it to this point to fly with my dad, it was probably my number one aviation goal,” the younger Flowers tells CNN Travel.\\n \\n      After rediscovering the old photo, the two Flowers men added a coda to the goal: not only did they want to fly together, they wanted to recreate the 1990s flight deck photo, over two decades later. Not just as father and son, but as colleagues and co-pilots.\\n   \\n      Cut to March 2023 and the older Flowers was flying his final Southwest flight, piloting an aircraft from Omaha, Nebraska to his home city of Chicago, Illinois. His son was by his side, as his first officer.\\n   \\n      “That was an awesome feeling,” says the older Flowers. “To look over there and see my son, next to me, for my last landing.”\\n   \\n      And, naturally, they recreated the 1994 photo, both grinning happily in the 2023 version.\\n   \\n      “It was just great to be able to recreate that moment,” says the younger Flowers. “It was a dream come true moment.”\\n   \\n      Also on board the older Flowers’ retirement flight was his brother and his cousin, who both work for Southwest too. In case you hadn’t realized by now, flying truly is a family affair for the Flowers.\\n   \\n      “There are seven of us,” explains the older Flowers. “Me. My brother’s a pilot. I have three kids, all pilots. And my brother’s son is a pilot and my cousin is a pilot. And it’s just amazing to me that they all wanted to be pilots.”\\n   \\n      At family events and on holidays, the Flowers family try to keep work talk to a minimum “but there’s always a story that sparks it off, and then it gets into aviation,” as the younger Flowers puts it.\\n   \\n      The Flowers family aviation legacy began when the older Flowers was a kid growing up in Michigan in the 1960s and 70s.\\n   \\n      “A pilot one day asked me if I wanted to come up to the cockpit. And I did it,” he recalls. “And oh, my God, it was like the bug bit me – I wanted to be a pilot. And from that point on, I just focused on being an airline pilot.”\\n   \\n      Once he qualified, the older Flowers made it his mission to inspire others to follow in his footsteps. The fact that ended up including many of his loved ones was accidental. He says he always encouraged his kids to explore whatever they loved, whatever that might be.\\n   \\n      The younger Flowers says that while he grew up in awe of his dad and proud of his work, he didn’t officially decide to become an aviator until midway through college.\\n   \\n      Looking back now though, he thinks the signs were always pointing in that direction.\\n   \\n      “It was always something that was probably in the back of my head that I probably wanted to do all my life,” he says.\\n   \\n      The older Flowers’ retirement flight was always going to be emotional, and having his son by his side only made it more so. He says it’s not surprising that when they pulled into the gate “some tears came down.”\\n   \\n      The younger Flowers says the in-air, father-son working dynamic wasn’t dissimilar from “doing the lawn together, or something of that nature.”\\n   \\n      “It just worked out smooth and naturally, and it went great,” he says, although he adds he was definitely trying to “impress” his dad with his skills and competency.\\n   \\n      The older Flowers says he was aware the flight was a one-off opportunity for him to pass on flying intel to his son in situ.\\n   \\n      “It went really well, it was nice and smooth,” he says of the experience. “And it was an awesome feeling – making a PA to the passengers, and they find out there’s a father and son up there in the cockpit. Everybody clapping…”\\n   \\n      While the older Flowers has now left Southwest, his legacy lives on at the airline – not only via his son, but via other aviators he worked with and mentored over the years.\\n   \\n      Flowers speaks fondly of his own mentor, Louis Freeman, who became Southwest Airlines first Black pilot when he was hired in 1980.\\n   \\n      “He was a mentor to me,” says the older Flowers of Freeman. “And now I’m trying to be a mentor to others. And I hope my son can be a mentor to others, not just family members.”\\n   \\n      While at Southwest, Flowers was part of the airline’s Adopt-A-Pilot program, working with elementary school kids to inspire them to explore careers in aviation.\\n   \\n      He’s also a longtime member of the Organization of Black Aerospace Professionals (OBAP), where he works to uplift Black aviators.\\n   \\n      He encourages prospective pilots to do their research online, look out for programmes, and speak to anyone and everyone they can to get inspiration, information and advice.\\n   \\n      The younger Flowers echoes this – he’s actively involved in mentoring young pilots via social media, but he’s also had the occasional in-person conversation with a prospective pilot while transiting through the airport. He says if he can, he’ll always stop and pass on a few words of wisdom between flights.\\n   \\n      As for his own personal goals, now that he’s achieved his dream of flying with his father, the younger Flowers next dream is to fly side-by-side with his younger brother, who has just recently completed pilot training.\\n   \\n      He’s already had the pleasure of flying with his pilot sister several years ago and says it would be incredible if he could complete the family trifecta.\\n   \\n      “That’s what I’m looking forward to, is to be able to fly in the plane with my brother,” he says.\\n   \\n      The older Flowers is excited for that day too, and says he’s unendingly proud of his three children.\\n   \\n      “It’s unbelievable,” he says. “It’s an awesome feeling to know that my son is flying, and my daughter and my youngest son, all three of them are flyers.”\\n  ',\n",

       "  'contents': ' \\n      NBA great and popular TV analyst Charles Barkley has urged Ja Morant to focus on basketball and “stay out of trouble” as the Memphis Grizzlies’ star continues to serve a lengthy suspension for incidents involving firearms.\\n   \\n      In June, the NBA suspended Morant for 25 games without pay after he was involved in several incidents where he was caught on video with guns which were published on social media.\\n   \\n      The suspension runs through the start of the current 2023-24 regular season, which tipped off on Tuesday. The first game Morant would be eligible to play is on December 19 against the New Orleans Pelicans.\\n   \\n      Morant had already been suspended from team activities in May after an Instagram Live video appearing to show him flashing a gun while in a vehicle with others circulated on social media, just two months after he was suspended over a similar video.\\n   \\n      The NBA had previously suspended Morant for eight games without pay in March after he was seen in a different Instagram Live video holding a gun in a nightclub in Glendale, Colorado, a suburb of Denver.\\n   \\n      Barkley, who is set to host a new prime-time show on CNN alongside \\u200b\\u200bGayle King, has previously criticized Morant and explained his reasons for doing so in an in-depth interview with Chris Wallace host of “Who’s Talking to Chris Wallace” streaming now on Max.\\n   \\n      “He’s caught with a gun, he gets suspended and then, less than two months later, he gets filmed again on Instagram with a gun and you’re like, ‘Kid can’t be that stupid,’” said Barkley.\\n   \\n      “[The] kid is getting paid close to $100 million and the only thing you have to do is don’t be a fool. Just play basketball. Ain‘t like it’s a real job.\\n   \\n      “We’re not like teachers. We’re not like firemen. We’re not like policemen. We’re not somebody who’s in the service. We’re not a doctor. Those are five real jobs.\\n   \\n      “Real jobs [with] people who will never make a lot of money and all you have to do is dribble a stupid basketball and stay out of trouble.”\\n   \\n      After receiving his suspension, Morant apologized and said he would use the time off to work on his mental health and decision-making.\\n   \\n      “I’m sorry for the harm I’ve done,” he said in a statement.\\n   \\n      “To the kids who look up to me, I’m sorry for failing you as a role model. I promise I’m going to be better. To all of my sponsors, I’m going to be a better representation of our brands. And to all of my fans, I’m going to make it up to you, I promise.”\\n   \\n      CNN has reached out to Morant’s representatives for comment.\\n   \\n      Barkley said he would never shy away from giving his opinion on air, adding that “you lose credibility” when you don’t tell the truth on television.\\n   \\n      His authenticity and willingness to speak his mind have helped the former NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP) become one of the most popular television personalities in the US.\\n   \\n      It follows a brilliant career in the league, where he played 16 seasons and was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame in 2006.\\n   \\n      Despite never winning an NBA Championship, the 60-year-old won two Olympic gold medals, made 11 All-Star teams, won the MVP award in 1993 and was named to the NBA’s 50th and 75th anniversary teams.\\n   \\n      Since retiring, Barkley has built a successful media career, but had briefly hinted at a possible switch to politics, expressing an interest in becoming the governor of Alabama.\\n   \\n      However, the NBA legend said he was, and is still, uninspired by the major political forces in the US.\\n   \\n      “I consider myself an Independent because I hate the words Republican, Democratic, Conservative and Liberal,” he said.\\n   \\n      “I think you can be one of those things, but you don’t think that way on every subject.\\n   \\n      “I really thought hard about running for governor but then I realized, like, I don’t think either one of these parties are really concerned about people and that’s what America is: people.”\\n   \\n      Barkley said he was equally unimpressed about next year’s US election, which may once again be fought between US President Joe Biden and previous incumbent Donald Trump, saying he didn’t’ “feel good about a rematch.”\\n   \\n      While not afraid to delve into the world of politics, Barkley still holds a deep love for the game of basketball.\\n   \\n      It’s a sport which gave him the platform to speak about matters he’s passionate about and a career which changed the entire trajectory of his family’s life.\\n   \\n      “I wanted to be successful,” he said, looking back at what inspired him at the start of his playing career. “You know, basketball, it meant so much to me.”\\n   \\n      “I think about my life. I’m from a small town of a couple thousand people. My mom was a maid, my grandmother worked in a meat factory. You know, I grew up in the projects.\\n   \\n      “All I had to do was be good at basketball and I was able to change the entire dynamics of my life and my family’s life. I was thinking about that the whole time.\\n   \\n      “I don’t want to be poor anymore. All I got to do is rebound and the rest is history,” added Barkley, who has donated millions of dollars to a number of causes, including supporting historically Black colleges in the US.\\n   \\n      With the new NBA season back underway, Barkley isn’t shy about predicting this year’s champion.\\n   \\n      “The Boston Celtics,” he said, with his trademark confidence.\\n   \\n      Barkley’s new CNN show, ‘King Charles,’ is set to start this fall and continue into 2024.\\n   \\nThe full interview on “Who’s Talking to Chris Wallace” is streaming now on Max.\\n',\n",

       "  'contents': ' \\n      Newcastle United and Italy midfielder Sandro Tonali has been banned for 10 months for violating betting regulations, the president of the Italian Football Federation (FIGC), Gabriele Gravina, said on Thursday.\\n   \\n      “The agreement has already been reached between the Federal Prosecutor’s Office and Sandro Tonali, which occurred before the referral, therefore it must be endorsed by the undersigned, which I have already done,” said Gravina after leaving the 23-year-old player’s hearing as filmed by a number of Italian media outlets, including CNN affiliate Sky24.\\n   \\n      Tonali, who joined Newcastle from AC Milan in July, will be unavailable for both club and country until August next year, meaning he would be unavailable to represent Italy’s men’s national team at the 2024 Euros if the Azzurri successfully qualify.\\n   \\n      Tonali’s representatives were in Italy to negotiate a plea deal on his behalf. Tonali has not publicly commented on the case.\\n   \\n      CNN has reached out to Tonali’s lawyers and agency for comment.\\n   \\n      Ahead of Newcastle’s Premier League game against Crystal Palace last Saturday, the club’s manager Eddie Howe told the BBC that Tonali had been “handling himself really well and is dealing with emotions incredibly strongly.”\\n   \\n      According to Gravina, the plea agreement reached between the player’s representatives and the federal prosecutor ensures a reduced punishment for the midfielder.\\n   \\n      Article 24 of the FIGC’s sporting justice code prohibits players from placing or taking bets on events organized by the FIGC, FIFA and UEFA. If a player is found to have breached the article, they can be punished with a three-year ban, but this can be reduced with a guilty plea.\\n   \\n      The 23-year-old will also undergo a therapy plan for gambling issues – which his lawyers said were connected to gambling addiction, according to Reuters – as well as making 16 speaking appearances as community service.\\n   \\n      Tonali signed for Newcastle in the summer for a reported fee of $74 million, per Reuters. This was a record sum for an Italian player.\\n   \\n      During his time with AC Milan, Tonali helped the club win its first Serie A title in 11 years in the 2021/22 season and reach last season’s Champions League semifinals.\\n   \\n      Tonali came on as a second-half substitute in Newcastle’s Champions League defeat to Borussia Dortmund on Wednesday.\\n   \\n      The decision comes just weeks after Juventus midfielder Nicolò Fagioli was handed a seven-month ban and fined €12,500 ($13,200) for also breaching betting rules.\\n   \\n      The 22-year-old Fagioli also has to undergo gambling therapy and attend “at least 10 public meetings” to speak as part of his treatment.\\n   \\n      Tonali and his fellow Italy international teammate Nicolò Zaniolo withdrew from the national team squad earlier this month after their involvement in gambling investigations was released.

       " {'headline': '\\n      How the battle for golf’s soul gave Tiger Woods new-found purpose – and human connection\\n    ',\n",
       "  'contents': ' \\nTiger Woods has made so many comebacks in his extraordinary golfing career that they have become an integral part of his legend.\\n   \\n      But after his 2021 high-speed, single-car accident in the Los Angeles suburbs, even Woods must have known that a serious comeback was unlikely. His right leg had been smashed to pieces, and he was lucky that it was still attached to the rest of his body.\\n   \\n      What the 15-time major champion needed now wasn’t so much a comeback in a competitive sense but rather a way back onto the course. Renowned golf writer Alan Shipnuck believes that the emergence of the Saudi-backed LIV Golf tour provided Woods with the most unlikely of pathways.\\n   \\n      “This battle for the soul of professional golf gave Tiger a purpose,” Shipnuck told CNN Sport. “It gave him a rallying cry. He was this galvanizing figure for the PGA Tour, fighting for its legacy.”\\n   \\n      In the spring and summer of 2022, men’s professional golf had been plunged into a crisis. As the game’s biggest stars were being tempted by guaranteed salaries well into eight figures, the game was cleaved into a world of “haves and have-mores,” as Shipnuck described it.\\n   \\n      As the battlelines were drawn and the rhetoric became increasingly heated, Woods arrived on the scene as the game’s elder statesman, eager to make a stand for golfing heritage.\\n   \\n      Fighting back from injury, divorce, and scandal, Woods’ headlines had been less about golf for those who weren’t around for his golden years. He won the Masters in 2019, but that was 11 years after his previous major win.\\n   \\n      “Tiger’s always been a loner,” Shipnuck explained. “He’s always been an introvert, and there’s entire generations that don’t know him at all because he’s been injured for so long.”\\n   \\n      But that began to change after Woods flew into Delaware to head up an impromptu players’ meeting, at which they all thrashed out a new direction for the PGA Tour.\\n   \\n      “I really think it’s been a crucial part of Tiger’s road back from that accident, to have more human connection and to feel the love and the warm embrace of his colleagues. I don’t think you can overstate how important that that this has been for Tiger.\\n   \\n      “We may ultimately have to thank LIV Golf for giving us a new, improved, and more engaged Tiger Woods!”\\n   \\n      Shipnuck’s new book, “LIV And Let Die,” chronicles the tumultuous emergence of the breakaway tour.\\n   \\n      Australian two-time major champion Greg Norman emerges as the chief provocateur in the book, whose long-standing desire to shake up the game was re-energized by the seemingly limitless reserves of Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund.\\n   \\n      It’s a compelling read, littered with so much profanity that it sometimes reads more like a screenplay for a Quentin Tarantino movie than a book about a traditionally genteel sport.\\n   \\n      Two of the 62 f**ks in the book come from five-time major champion Brooks Koepka, who joined the LIV Tour in the summer of June, 2022.\\n   \\n      “F**k all of those country club kids who talk sh*t about me,” Koepka is quoted as saying, “You think I give a f**k what they think about me? You think I care what people say about me? I had three surgeries and I’m supposed to turn down $130 million? I grew up with nothing.”\\n   \\n      Shipnuck accepts that the colorful language speaks to the highly charged emotions on both sides.\\n   \\n      “I never think it’s my job to edit someone’s language, if they’re fired up and if they have something that they want to say forcefully, then I just let it go,” adds Shipnuck.\\n   \\n      “The passions were so inflamed, it became very personal to the players, to the executives, and to the money guys behind the scenes. It took some time to get people to really talk honestly like they did, including those four-letter words!”\\n   \\n      Shipnuck says that he spoke with players, caddies, CEOs, agents, financiers, lawyers, fans and wives for his book, but it has not been well received by everybody.\\n   \\n      Writing on the X platform, formerly known as Twitter, two-time major champion Justin Thomas said: “I’d like to speak on behalf of a lot of tour players and say we’re sick of @AlanShipnuck doing what he does.\\n   \\n      “Bring positivity and good stories to help grow the game of golf, not try and make money bashing guys, earning zero trust, with a lot of incorrect information. Ridiculous.”\\n   \\n      Shipnuck has defended his work, telling CNN that he’s not a “publicist, I’m a journalist.”\\n   \\n      “My obligation’s to the reader, not to the players,” Shipnuck adds. “They count on me to give them the truth and tell them what’s really happening behind the scenes.\\n   \\n      “When you do that, you offer this counter-narrative for what the players want to believe, what they’ve been told by their leadership, what’s in their best interest; they sometimes get upset about it. I feel that it’s really their problem, not mine.”\\n   \\n      Shipnuck describes the overarching themes of the narrative are loyalty and betrayal, vengeance and greed, but there’s much more nuance than might have seemed apparent at the time.\\n   \\n      Rory McIlroy, whose full-throated and principled defense of the PGA Tour earned him a badge of honor in the esteem of many, was seen as “the moral conscience of golf.” But Shipnuck hints that perhaps it wasn’t quite so black-and-white.\\n   \\n      “Rory also emerged as the leading troll,” Shipnuck tells CNN. “Rory was a great ambassador for the tour, but he made it very personal.\\n   \\n      “And the LIV players rolled their eyes about Rory being held up as this white knight because Rory has tremendous business interests through the PGA Tour that he’s also fighting to protect.”\\n   \\n      Equally, perhaps there was more to the so-called villains than first met the eye.\\n   \\n      “It misses all the nuance to say they just sold out and took the money,” says Shipnuck. “I mean, obviously, the money was an inducement. Everybody understands that. But there were more things going on.”\\n   \\n      Shipnuck explains that 2020 US Open champion Bryson DeChambeau, a young man in his prime, was one of the more surprising players to join LIV.\\n   \\n      In the book, a narrative emerges that indicates the American player felt undervalued by his peers on the PGA Tour. Shipnuck told CNN of the pain in DeChambeu’s voice as he spoke about it, writing:\\n   \\n      “He told me that, six years in a row, he tried to get elected to the player Advisory Council on the PGA Tour. It’s like running for president when you’re in high school, but for six years in a row, his peers rejected him. He had real pain in his voice when he told me, ‘I guess they just don’t like me.’”\\n   \\n      Once he’d joined the LIV Tour, DeChambeau assumed a leadership position as a team captain.\\n   \\n      “Patrick Reed and Sergio García had worn out their welcome on the PGA Tour. They were disliked by their peers; they were feuding with the leadership. LIV was just a fresh start, a new organization that caters to the players and has a different mentality.\\n   \\n      “Phil Mickelson needed to be validated as the smartest guy in the room. All of them wanted the money, clearly, but there’s a lot more at play. The ‘good guys’ always have a little shadow, and with the ‘bad guys,’ there’s usually a redeeming quality or two.”\\n   \\n      Ultimately, for all the bitterness and acrimony, it could be that all the players will end up on the same side.\\n   \\n      Almost exactly a year to the day since LIV played its inaugural tournament in London, PGA Tour Commissioner Jay Monahan and PIF Governor Yasir Al-Rumayyan revealed that they had brokered a surprise truce and settled their lawsuits.\\n \\n      While the full details have yet to be hammered out, the pair announced that, along with the European Tour, they would join up to create an entity that would unify the game.\\n   \\n      “They all doubled and tripled their salaries,” Shipnuck explained. “One of Phil Mickelson’s primary complaints was that the PGA Tour was sitting on a lot of money that belonged to the players. You could say he was vindicated in that regard.”\\n   \\n      The fans could also win, as a result.\\n   \\n      “If they can create a schedule where you take maybe the best dozen PGA Tour events, the best five or six on the European tour, and two or three LIV events and you put this together in a way that makes sense geographically and throughout the year – and all the best players will always show up – that would be a huge win for golf fans,” according to Shipnuck.\\n   \\n      Assuming the Saudis remain involved with the project, it would also be a win for them.\\n   \\n      To take a seat at the table of a major international sport and walk the corridors of power and influence in the western world after emerging from the shadow of their alleged involvement in 9/11, the murder of Jamal Khashoggi and a poor human rights record would be a significant coup.\\n   \\n      Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has previously said he doesn’t “care” about the country’s investment in sport being described as sportswashing.\\n   \\n      “Well if sportswashing is going to increase my GDP by one percent, then I will continue doing sportswashing,” MBS said in an\\xa0interview\\xa0with Fox News which aired in September.\\n   \\n      The LIV episode is proof, Shipnuck argues, that sportswashing works.\\n   \\n      “In the first year of LIV, the players were pounded with questions about Khashoggi, about [Crown Prince] Mohammad Bin Salman, about the human rights abuses of the Saudi government against its own citizens. And by year two, those questions started to disappear because fatigue sets in.\\n   \\n      “That’s why sportswashing is so popular among certain bad actors because it does have that effect over time. You normalize these countries.\\n   \\n      “Over time, the resistance starts to fade away and there does become this acceptance that they’re part of professional sports or part of the global economy. And, maybe, they are our allies.”\\n   \\n      CNN has reached out to Woods, McIroy, Reed and Garcia for comment.\\n  ',\n",

       "  'contents': ' \\n      For over two decades now, Heidi Klum has served up tricks, treats and ever-outlandish ensembles to retain her title as the queen of celebrity Halloween costumes, arriving at her annual bash on or in gurneys, spaceships, biohazard trucks and clouds of smoke.\\n   \\n      And that’s before we even get to the looks themselves.\\n   \\n      When the German model first moved to the United States in 1993, she “immediately fell in love with Halloween and the spookiness of it,” Klum told The Hollywood Reporter in 2018. “All that was missing was a fantastic party. It felt like a real opportunity for me.”\\n   \\n      In the years since, Klum has spent hundreds of hours in, and likely hundreds of thousands of dollars on, hair, makeup and prosthetics preparing for her star-studded festivities, dedicated to her goal of doing for Halloween what nobody has dared do before.\\n   \\n      “I have sleepless nights over Halloween; you have no idea,” Klum told People magazine earlier this month. “I can’t rehearse this; it’s only on the day. I always hope that it works out.”\\n   \\n      Musing over what her next costume will be often begins the day after Halloween, she told THR, because of both enthusiasm and needing ample time to construct such elaborate costumes.\\n   \\n      We’ve yet to see what Klum has up her sleeve this spooky season, though she did tell Entertainment Tonight that “it’s going to be very colorful, and super big.” For now, then, here are some of her most iconic Halloween looks from years past — from 2022 dating back to the early aughts.\\n   \\n      Last Halloween, Klum wriggled and writhed into her annual party as a very realistic earthworm, with only her eyes peeking through the sculptural worm-suit itself. (She later changed into a sheer bedazzled bodysuit for the party — lest she be limited to doing the worm on the dance floor — but left her facial prothesis on.)\\n   \\n      Klum’s husband Tom Kaulitz accompanied her on the red carpet dressed as a fisherman with a ghoulish twist — a prosthetic eyeball hanging from his socket.\\n   \\n      Perhaps one of Klum’s creepiest costumes, her 2019 look saw her dressed in a head-to-toe bodysuit resembling a decomposing body — scarred and visceral, flayed in parts and with an exposed brain — seemingly revivified by cables and other surgical bits.\\n   \\n      Klum and Kaulitz — a zombified astronaut, naturally — arrived together in a biohazard truck.\\n   \\n      In 2018 Klum and Kaulitz dressed as animated movie stars Fiona and Shrek, respectively, in costumes so realistic it was as if they had walked off a character parade float at Universal Studios.\\n   \\n      Back in 2017, Klum paid homage to Michael Jackson’s “Thriller” music video by recreating the werewolf look Jackson transformed into in the music video’s movie-within-a-movie opening scene. As well as meticulously copying the clothes Jackson wore in the video, the costume\\xa0also incorporated prosthetics, so Klum’s werewolf face moved with her own features. (Klum’s zombie entourage, also pictured above, referenced the second horror movie trope referenced in “Thriller.”)\\n   \\n      Technically this wasn’t a costume “on” Klum, because she came to her party dressed as herself. Her Halloween twist, though, came with her plus-one — or plus-five, rather: a group of models she enlisted to appear as clones, using eerily-accurate prosthetics and identical outfits.\\n   \\n      Halloween is often synonymous with “sexy,” and in 2015 Klum went as one of Hollywood’s most iconic sex symbols, Jessica Rabbit — a costume both realistic and yet also so quintessentially cartoonish. The costume’s two hours-long removal at the end of the night — which cost her some of her own skin — called for a nail polish remover-like substance and a chisel, Klum told People magazine.\\n   \\n      As a longtime Victoria’s Secret Angel, Klum had spent years wearing wings for the lingerie brand’s annual Fashion Show, but never ones quite like this. For her 2014 party, Klum become a butterfly — with wings hand-painted by artisans who’d worked on Victoria’s Secret Angels’ wings. Her glowing bugs’ eyes were powered by batteries placed inside the mask, near her real eyes.\\n   \\n      Klum aged herself by a few decades for this Halloween costume. From head to toe, she was made unrecognizable with layers upon layers of makeup and prosthetics that gave her wrinkles, sagging skin, age spots and yellow teeth. (Nonetheless, she donned an elegant tweed twinset, paired with a paisley blouse, pearls and a tan handbag.)\\n   \\n      “Just going into my future is what I wanted to do for myself,” she told Yahoo Entertainment in 2022. “I wanted to, like, look in the mirror and be like, ‘OK, I want to see, you know, what I might look like when I’m like in my 80s.”\\n   \\n      A predecessor of sorts to her alien zombie look, Klum in 2011 wore a body suit (and matching face paint) designed to look like the human body sans skin. She made a grand entrance to her first of two parties that year in Las Vegas rolling in on a gurney pushed by two people dressed as bloody doctors.\\n   \\n      But that wasn’t all — in her second look for a party in New York City, Klum and then-husband Seal donned outfits inspired by the “Planet of the Apes” films.\\n   \\n      “We didn’t really think about, you know, going to the bathroom,” Klum told Yahoo Entertainment of the costumes. “It was very tricky.”\\n   \\n      In preparation for her red and purple costume that transformed her into a “Transformers”-worthy robot, for days Klum practiced walking on stilts in her backyard, she told People magazine. “It was amazing, though, because I was so tall and I could just tower over everyone,” Klum said — until she’d had a few drinks.\\n   \\n      Then nine months pregnant with her third child, Klum and then-husband Seal dressed as the biblical forbidden fruit (wrapped by the serpent, no less) and Eve, respectively. The original sin here, though, is the lack of effort put into Seal’s ensemble.\\n   \\n      In a testament to just how over-the-top Klum’s costumes have become, it’s telling that her 2004 look — a sexy vampire witch costume which featured a voluminous wig, oversize witch’s hat, knee-high boots and blood red makeup — now seems positively understated. “I was rigged from the ceiling and then I was flying over all the people like ‘Happy Halloween ha ha ha’ on my broom with a skeleton on my back,” she told People of her grand entrance to that year’s party.\\n   \\n      Since she wanted a full, realistic skeleton, Klum bought one from a supply store for doctor’s office materials.\\n   \\n      At her 2003 party, Klum made her arrival by exiting a golden spaceship, dressed as a cyberpunk-style golden alien. Reminiscent also of the Grecian god Hermes, her look featured gold armor and boots with leaf accents, golden belt detailing, gold body glitter, a golden grill and gold ribbons woven into her long braids.\\n   \\n      In 2001, Klum dressed as the 11th-century Anglo-Saxon gentlewoman Lady Godiva. Though the eponymous legend told of Godiva’s naked ride through the English town of Coventry on horseback, Klum covered up, wearing a white bodysuit with crystalline detailing. She added a long blonde wig.\\n   \\n      “I was always looking for something that I hadn’t seen, and so I was Lady Godiva,” Klum told People magazine.\\xa0“I came on a horse, obviously.

       " {'headline': '\\n      The Filipino American creatives who are reclaiming the barong\\n    ',\n",
       "  'contents': ' \\nEditor’s Note:\\xa0This feature is part of CNN Style’s series\\xa0Hyphenated, which explores the complex issue of identity among minorities in the United States.\\n \\nCNN — As a first-generation child of Filipino American immigrants, I grew up with wistful stories my parents told of their homeland, rich in details from their childhoods spent in a country that seemed as foreign to me as the fictitious lands described in fairytales. These stories were told in a tone that encapsulated both a yearning to seize opportunity in the West and for a life where they didn’t feel like outsiders — where conformity to American culture was not a daily burden.\\n   \\n      Many of these stories centered on my paternal great uncle, Philippine President Ramon Magsaysay, and his role cementing the barong Tagalog, a sheer button-down shirt often emblazoned with hand stitched embroidery, as the country’s official formal wear.\\n   \\n      More recently, the barong Tagalog — which translates loosely to “dress of the Philippines” and is often abbreviated to barong — has surged in popularity with Filipinos across the diaspora as a point of national pride and style.\\n   \\n      “(The barong) is inherently so glamorous,” explained wardrobe stylist and fashion editor Rap Sarmiento. “With its sheerness and embroidery, it lends itself to the moment. Second generation kids are embracing this.”\\n   \\n      The origins of the barong are widely seen as dating back to times before the Philippines was colonized by Spain in the 15th century. Both a status symbol and everyday garment, its sheer fabric has been explained as either a practical design choice, to deal with the intense heat and humidity of the Philippines, or one borne of oppression, with Spanish colonizers wanting to ensure Filipino natives could not steal items or conceal weapons under their clothes.\\n   \\n      “The Spanish took (the barong) to all of their colonies… other countries have their own versions,” said Caroline Mangosing, founder and designer of Vinta Gallery, a Canadian-based brand that specializes in Filipino clothing. “Cuba has the guayabera with pockets. The Dominican Republic has a version with pleating.”\\n   \\n      During his 1953 inauguration, President Magsaysay wore a barong to show solidarity with the common man. It sparked wide acceptance of the shirt as the Philippines’ answer to a formal suit or tuxedo, and became a garment which struck a strong contrast to westernized suits and ties on the global stage.\\n   \\n      The inauguration marked one of many times President Magsaysay used the barong as a signal toward Philippine independence and resilience, in the period after the nearly 50-year colonization of the country by the United States had come to an end. Supporting his Filipino First Policy to strengthen and grow the economy, the President and his administration invested in garment manufacturing and textile mills, with many using the native materials from which barongs are traditionally made — piña (pineapple fiber) abaca (hemp) and jusi (piña and hemp combined), in turn stoking local industry and the general Filipino public’s interest in native garments made from native fibers\\xa0— said his son (and my uncle), former Senator of the Philippines Ramon Magsaysay Jr.\\n   \\n      “He was committed to supporting Filipino nationalism for our country and people,” Magsaysay Jr. said. “(During his inauguration), we could see him proudly showing his Filipino-made clothing and shoes to a big crowd.”\\n   \\n      The barong’s evolution following Magsaysay’s presidency is also as compelling as its colorful and complicated past. President Ferdinand Marcos’ use of the garment, for example, saw its popularity wane among many Filipinos over time.\\n   \\n      “There was a political hangover. People didn’t want to be like them,” said Mangosing of Marcos and his wife Imelda, whose predilection for Filipiniana (traditional women’s dress) also saw the fashions go out of style once they were exiled from the country. “After that, I feel like everyone stopped wearing barongs for a while, so it stopped evolving — what remained were mass-market versions in garish colors.”\\n   \\n      But as more Filipinos have permeated fashion, music and pop culture at large in the United States (and around the world) in recent years, the barong has bounced back in ways that are strikingly creative, individual and inspiring.\\n   \\n      Vinta Gallery’s barongs, which are handmade and embroidered at an atelier in the Philippines, range from $300 to $600 for a ready-to-wear version and can swing north of $1000 for custom. They are among the brand’s most popular items, Mangosing told CNN, particularly those embroidered with anting-anting or other charms based on Philippine folk magic.\\n   \\n      Last year, Jian DeLeon, men’s fashion director at Nordstrom, collaborated with the menswear label Bode on a shirt inspired by a traditional barong, but made from a non-traditional cotton linen blend fabric.\\n   \\n      “I took inspiration from when French designer Pierre Cardin redesigned the (shirt) silhouette in the 1970s,” De Leon said.\\xa0“Cardin added touches like a camp collar and French cuffs and embraced a more global style of embroidery. I think these are the kinds of projects that can put these inherently Filipino fashion items into a global context.”\\n   \\n      Attending a Nike “Filipino Forces” dinner in Los Angeles last fall, an event celebrating Filipino Americans working in music, fashion and entertainment, Sarmiento wore his father’s barong over a t-shirt from Rhude, a black tennis skirt and black Margiela Tabi boots. “It was a way to bring it forward,” said the stylist.\\n   \\n      At the same event, designer and influencer Aleali May wore a barong with distressed jeans, hoop earrings and limited-edition Nike Air Force One sneakers.\\n   \\n      “When I first started in music, I was usually the only Filipino at events, and now it’s typical to see 3 or 4 of us, so it’s not unusual to see a barong being worn,” said music executive Marisa Pizarro. “It’s an elevated look without having to wear a suit. You rarely see suits (in creative industries) anymore.”\\n   \\n      Other Filipino-American celebrities have recently opted to don a barong both on red carpets and other highly visible events. Last year, Levi’s created a custom-made denim barong for Jo Koy, juxtaposing the traditional garment’s fabrics with the cut of a trucker jacket. Covering the opening night of Broadway musical “Here Lies Love” for Vogue Philippines, photographer Martin Romero noted that, “a lot of the men, specifically the cast members, and a lot of the guests, wore traditional and modern barongs.” Likewise, the barong has become increasingly ubiquitous among Gen Z on social media, with young people wearing brands like Vinta Gallery and The Mestizo on their Instagram and TikTok feeds.\\n   \\n      NBA players Klay Thompson and Kevon Looney — who are not Filipino — recently wore barongs during their Asia tour as ambassadors for athletic brand Anta. “It looks wonderful. And feels even better, too,” Thompson told Esquire Philippines of the garment. It was a gesture the magazine described as a “Pinoy Pride moment.”\\n   \\n      “It’s a combination of social media and awareness of Filipino culture — wanting to wear traditional garb to show off our culture,” said entrepreneur Rembrandt Flores. “Younger people’s interest is piqued and they are choosing to wear the barong as a source of pride and sartorial creativity.”\\n  ',\n",

       " {'headline': '\\n      The photographer taking couple selfies to the extreme\\n    ',\n",
       "  'contents': ' \\n      In one of Pixy Liao’s photographs, she wrestles with her boyfriend Moro in a hotel room; in another, she flings his naked body over her shoulder and carries him in the way a fireman might rescue someone.\\n   \\n      The images form part of her ongoing project “Experimental Relationship” — first profiled by CNN in 2019 — which began in 2007, a year after she met Moro. The series  playfully explores the intimacy and dynamics of being in a long-term relationship.\\n   \\n      When I meet Liao, she and Moro are crouching in picturesque window arches at La Residencia hotel,\\xa0overlooking the beautiful countryside of the Spanish island of Mallorca. As she\\xa0carefully orchestrates images of the two of them —\\xa0standing, sitting, pointing, holding a mirror to the camera — a nearby couple takes smartphone selfies in the sunshine, kissing. Liao is undertaking a two-month residency here in the art-steeped mountain town of Deià to continue “Experimental Relationship.” Naturally, Moro is along for the ride.\\n   \\n      Liao met Moro — five years her junior — at the University of Memphis, Tennessee, where she studied photography. When she started to take pictures of him, it\\xa0became a vehicle to explore what kind of relationship she wanted — and her own identity.\\xa0“Growing up in China, I didn’t see any examples of female role models that I wanted to be,” she said, sitting in her temporary studio at\\xa0the hotel. “It was like being the second best or supporting role, and I didn’t understand why it had to be that way.”\\n   \\n      Liao is expert at balancing the banal with the erotic, and exploring the power dynamics at play when humans engage in physical and emotional intimacy. In early photographs, Liao appears in a position of domination; deploying the female gaze and exerting power over Moro. One image (“Start your day\\xa0with a\\xa0good breakfast together,” 2009) shows Liao eating breakfast off Moro’s naked body, staring into the camera, as he lies awkwardly on the kitchen table.\\n   \\n      But as her and Moro’s relationship evolved, so did the project. “As we grow older together, our relationship changes,” she explained. The tongue-in-cheek eroticism is still\\xa0there, as is the playful subversion, but in more recent photographs, Moro plays a more active role, in and out of the picture.\\xa0“He’s really involved in the creation process,” Liao said. “He sometimes knows what I want before I do.” It is often Moro, rather than Liao, operating the remote cable release control to take the photograph. Part of this, Liao explained, is about “sharing power with him.”\\n   \\n      Does the project cause tensions in their relationship? Liao doesn’t think so, but noted that it’s hard to work on the project when they’re fighting. “He refuses to collaborate with me,” she said. “My main task in life is to keep a good relationship with him,” she added, laughing.\\n   \\n      Liao believes the two most important things for “Experimental Relationship” are the ideas and the locations. The ideas — from making a naked Moro into human sushi, to screaming at each other, to bending over in underpants and peeking between their legs — are steeped in a kind-of fantasy. “It’s not exactly us, it’s another pair of us in a parallel universe that’s kind-of similar, but maybe something we would never do in real life,” she said. “It’s like a role-playing game.”\\n   \\n      The settings, meanwhile, shape the feel of the images. Liao looks for locations imbued with a sense that “stories can happen there.” We often see the couple in domestic interiors,\\xa0whether a bare-walled, drab house or a slick New York loft. But the series also transports us to more surprising settings: a rural hotel in Japan; a peaceful forest in Woodstock, New York.\\n   \\n      Liao doesn’t want the locations to be “too beautiful,” she said, so while in Deià\\xa0she has been looking for things that are “a little weird,” like a gnarled olive tree trunk with holes that she and Moro could poke their faces through.\\xa0The concept of play infuses much of her work. “Fun is the most important thing for me,” Liao said. “My priority is to satisfy myself, to entertain myself.”\\n   \\n      After her residency completes at the end of October — the last of a series of three this summer for the hotel, also including Anastasiia Podervianska and Sislej Xhafa — Liao will return home to Brooklyn with Moro. The work she creates will go on show in the hotel once it reopens for the 2024 season next March. And what of the future of “Experimental Relationship” — is there a planned end to the project? “I definitely want to do it as long as we’re together,” she said, smiling. With that, she goes off into the idyllic landscape on another photo shoot with Moro, living out their fantasies.\\n  ',\n",

       " {'headline': '\\n      This faux-leather jacket is made by bacteria\\n    ',\n",
       "  'contents': ' \\n      What do you get when you feed bacteria with industrial fruit waste? “A yellow leather jacket” might not be your first answer, but it’s exactly what came out of a collaboration between Danish fashion brand Ganni and Mexican biomaterials company Polybion.\\n   \\n      The blazer — a one-of-a-kind prototype that is meant as a proof of concept for future collections — is made from bacterial cellulose, and rather than trying to replicate the characteristics of leather, it’s designed to feel like an entirely new material.\\n   \\n      “We were impressed by the fact that a lot of people love the jacket because the material did not resemble leather,” said Alexis Gómez-Ortigoza, Polybion’s co-founder. “It’s really easy to recognize that this is not leather — but also that it’s not plastic. It has a unique feel to it.”\\n   \\n      Although it is produced using some of the methods associated with traditional leather, the blazer has a much smaller carbon footprint, without compromising on strength and breathability, say its creators. “This is the first jacket ever made by a global brand out of bacterial nanocellulose,” added Gómez-Ortigoza, “So it is a pretty important milestone for the biomaterials industry.”\\n   \\n      Gómez-Ortigoza, whose background is in finance, founded Polybion in 2014 with his brother, Axel, whose background is in biotechnology. Together with friend and materials scientist Bárbara González Rolón, they initially focused on mycelium, a root-like network of fungal threads, and opened a pilot plant for mycelium materials.\\n   \\n      Then, something peculiar happened. “About five years ago, a friend of mine stepped into my office and he showed me a kombucha jar,” recalled Gómez-Ortigoza. “We isolated our first bacteria from that drink.”\\n   \\n      Kombucha is an increasingly popular fermented tea drink, and the bacterial biomass used to make the jacket, called Celium, comes from that jar. Since then, Polybion has almost entirely pivoted to bacterial fermentation, as it deemed it a promising new source for a high-performance leather alternative.\\n   \\n      To feed the bacteria, Polybion uses scraps sourced from local canned fruit production plants, mainly from mangoes. “We feed the bacteria with fruit waste, which is extremely abundant here in central Mexico,” said Gómez-Ortigoza. “We turn it into food for the bacteria by adding a special formula developed by us that converts it into a growth medium.\\n   \\n      “The bacteria will then reproduce and generate the nanocellulose matrix as a metabolic byproduct, which we harvest after two weeks and then send through a tanning and finishing procedure.”\\n   \\n      The fruit waste would otherwise end up in a landfill, where it would decompose and generate methane — a greenhouse gas 25 times more powerful than carbon dioxide at trapping heat. Some producers, according to Gómez-Ortigoza, also burn or dump the waste illegally. The production of Celium creates about one quarter of the emissions compared to the greenest methods of leather production, and after factoring in the emissions avoided by rescuing the fruit waste, the process becomes carbon negative, Gómez-Ortigoza said.\\n   \\n      Once the nanocellulose is harvested, it is treated using techniques employed by local tanneries. “We use the same equipment as animal leather tanneries, but without chromium or any toxic chemicals,” said Gómez-Ortigoza. “Since this material is organic, it has a natural feel to it — it breathes and wears out in a similar way to leather. This is really important, especially for luxury brands.”\\n   \\n      Polybion is exploring the possibility of using Celium to make something other than textiles, including cardboard, thread, construction wood, and even wound dressings. “It has the potential to become a commodity, a widespread material for a different range of applications,” Gómez-Ortigoza added. “But as of right now, we are focused on a leather alternative, because we believe this application has the shortest time to market.”\\n   \\n      If you want to buy a bacterial jacket, you’ll have to wait just a little bit longer. “The blazer is a one-of-a-kind piece and unfortunately not for sale,” said Lauren Bartley, Ganni’s Sustainability and CSR Director. Ganni, which has committed to a 50% absolute carbon reduction for its operations by 2027, is working with other new types of fabric, with the aim of making 10% of its main collection from them by 2025. However, the company will be selling garments made from Celium in 2024.\\n   \\n      The design of the blazer is the same silhouette that Ganni successfully featured in previous collections using traditional materials — worn by Michelle Obama in an organic cotton version, Bartley says. “We went for a yellow color to give it the same bright feeling and impact as the versions of the blazer in bright pink and green made in wool in previous collections,” she adds.\\n   \\n      Polybion is planning similar projects with other fashion brands, although it won’t reveal the names yet. “All I can say that we are working with the biggest sportswear company in the world as well as three of the most important luxury fashion houses from France,” said Gómez-Ortigoza, adding that he expects to announce these in detail next year.\\n   \\n      Fashion houses are increasingly exploring innovative materials as a way to make their garments more sustainable. “The textile industry is looking to agricultural and food waste as a viable raw material for this new material revolution in response to the climate crisis, making better use of planetary resources without the need to use virgin ones,” said Kate Goldsworthy, a professor of Circular Design and Innovation at the University of the Arts London, who’s not involved with Polybion.\\n   \\n      “Textiles made from cellulose are certainly not new, but a growing range of innovative companies are finding new ways to produce cellulose fibers from waste streams. Polybion have considered the environment in every aspect of their production, and the supply chain is contained within a 30-mile radius, taking local production seriously,” she said, adding that the challenge is now scaling up production and getting consumers to embrace the materials as well.\\n   \\n      According to Kate Fletcher, a professor at the Royal Danish Academy, Copenhagen and Oslo Metropolitan University in Norway, while alternative materials like Celium are a welcome addition to the range of fabrics promising lower-impact clothing, this will never address the root cause of the sustainability challenge for fashion.\\n   \\n      “This challenge lies elsewhere: in addressing the year-on-year growth in scale of the fashion sector and reducing overproduction, without which impacts will continue to rise regardless of what material we make garments in,” she said.\\n  ',\n",

       "  'contents': ' \\n      On October 20, 1973 — exactly 50 years ago this Friday — the Sydney Opera House was opened to great fanfare by the late Queen Elizabeth II.\\n   \\n      Completed a decade late and vastly over-budget, the unusual-looking building was not an immediate hit with Australians. Yet, in the decades since, its striking shell-shaped roof helped it become an architectural icon and an UNESCO World Heritage Site that attracts over 10 million visitors a year.\\n   \\n      How different things might have been.\\n   \\n      Danish architect Jørn Utzon’s successful proposal was just one of 233 entries in an international design competition. Launched in 1955 by\\xa0New South Wales premier Joseph Cahill, who was a long-time advocate of transforming the site of an old tram depot into an opera house, the contest attracted participants from over 30 different counties.\\n   \\n      A document outlining the competition criteria, known as the “Brown Book,” described certain architectural requirements: The building would, for instance,\\xa0need a main hall capable of accommodating 3,000 to 3,500 people (though the final building has a capacity of under 2,700) and parking space for 100 cars. The document also addressed issues like ventilation and exit passageways. But, otherwise, designers were encouraged to indulge their imaginations\\xa0— with organizers\\xa0setting no limit for how much money proposals might cost to realize.\\n   \\n      Entrants were asked only for black and white drawings, including floor plans and diagrams, as well as a report that “should be as concise as possible, explaining only matters which cannot be readily explained on the drawings,” the Brown Book reads. So, in 2019, creative studio NeoMam Studios and now-defunct architecture firm Projection Comunicación Arquitectónica set about researching the entries and visualizing, in full color, how some of the proposals might have looked.\\n   \\n      They picked seven from the 232 unsuccessful entries — a selection process based both on the merits of the submissions and the amount of information available to researchers.\\n   \\n      “Some of them had a story, some of them were ones we knew we could do a good job with, and some were ones where we thought, ‘It would have been hilarious if they’d chosen something like this,’” NeoMam Studios’\\xa0CEO, Gisele Navarro,\\xa0recalled in a phone interview with CNN.\\n   \\n      And while Navarro concludes that competition judges ultimately “made the right choice,” she applauded some of the entrants’ “blue-sky thinking.”\\n   \\n      Quite how close any of these alternatives came to winning may be lost to history. But legend has it that Utzon’s winning design was initially dismissed, only to be saved from the reject pile by Finnish American architect Eero Saarinen, one of the judges.\\n   \\nHere are seven of the alternative designs that didn’t make the cut:\\n',\n",

It’s deeply distressing to hear that in these difficult times, some are making prank calls to Palestinians in Gaza, urging them to evacuate their homes in the middle of the night under the pretense of impending bombings.\\n   \\n      This has caused immense panic and fear for many families. Such actions are both heartless and unnecessary, particularly when thousands of homes have already been destroyed in Gaza.\\n   \\n      We once celebrated birthdays together, shared meals, laughed and forged cherished memories.\\xa0Yet today those memories lay in ruins, much like the places that were once our sanctuaries.\\n   \\n      My family, like countless others, is denied the simple privilege of reminiscing about better days as they endure another judgment day.\\n   \\n      My 71-year-old mother, surrounded by most of her children and their offspring, clings to the familial bond that keeps them together as they grapple with diminishing water supplies, and the oppressive cloak of darkness that accompanies a life without electricity.\\n   \\n      Their peculiar predicament places them in what is ironically deemed northern Gaza’s evacuation area, though escape remains a risky endeavor for many.\\n   \\n      The reasons for their inability to flee are multifaceted. The scarcity of fuel renders any vehicle moving in Gaza right now\\xa0—\\xa0let alone a car spacious enough to accommodate 20 people\\xa0—\\xa0a subject of suspicion. And venturing southward would lead them into unfamiliar territory, far from friends, family and the comforting familiarity of home. In a region where geography can determine life or death, this is a gamble few are willing to take.\\n   \\n      In a world where not even\\xa0my\\xa0colleagues adorned with the emblem of the UN are assured safety, the conundrum faced by civilians becomes a disquieting paradox.\\xa0How can ordinary Palestinians, like my family, be expected to find sanctuary when the lines between refuge and peril blur with each passing day?\\n   \\n      The struggles of the present serve as a testament to the unyielding spirit of the Palestinian people, a resilience that draws its strength from the painful memories of\\xa01948\\xa0when my grandparents fled for their lives, and\\xa01967\\xa0when our parents sought shelter within Gaza.\\n   \\n      These were times of similar adversity, times when our forebears endured and survived. The question that lingers, however, is why should their children and grandchildren be condemned to relive this ceaseless cycle of suffering?\\n   \\n      Looking back at those days, I have developed a deeper understanding of my relatives, who lived through the\\xa01948 Nakba\\xa0– and the uncertainty, the injustices, the powerlessness and the betrayal. Feelings instilled into a new generation of Palestinians who only grew up hearing stories\\xa0of their ethnic cleansing.\\n   \\n      Now the Palestinians in Gaza\\xa0are taking a trip down memory lane, with the realization in their march toward safety,\\xa0that\\xa0they are leaving behind places that they might as well never see again.\\n   \\n      The pain of loss and dispossession has been etched into our collective memory, serving as a somber and persistent reminder of our shared history.\\n   \\n      Earlier this week, I received a message from Amro, my 29-year-old nephew. Amro is fond of Gaza and staying there, despite having opportunities to travel and live outside of it.\\n   \\n      Amro made me promise that\\xa0if\\xa0he somehow survives this, I should help him find a way to leave Gaza forever. This was hard for me. Amro loved this coastal Mediterranean town, up until the most recent war.\\n   \\n      This essay serves as a heartfelt plea for understanding, compassion, and, above all, an urgent call for peace and the hope of a brighter future.\\n   \\n      Sadly, given the relentless duration of the crisis in Gaza, the prospects for such a future seem more elusive by the second.\\n  ',\n",

In this world of perpetual darkness\\xa0—\\xa0largely devoid of electricity, fuel, and the internet\\xa0—\\xa0my family has\\xa0now also receded from view.\\n   \\n      In the northern reaches of Gaza, over 20 members of my extended family seek shelter under the refuge of a staircase\\xa0—\\xa0a frail shield against the relentless and merciless storm of airstrikes.\\n   \\n      They tread cautiously, avoiding windows and the desolate streets where the overwhelming stench of death, fire and chaos hangs heavy in the air.\\n   \\n      When ambulances, fire departments, journalists and\\xa0UN staff find themselves bereft of protection, one can only imagine the plight of civilians like my family and dear friends in Gaza this week.\\n   \\n      The negative impact of this war on my family in Gaza is hard to overstate: hospitals running out of space for the dead and injured, pushing the local hospitals to\\xa0use ice cream trucks to preserve the bodies.\\n \\n      Hungry cats roam the streets of Gaza crying for food.\\n   \\n      And if this is not enough, our family in Gaza received a\\xa0prank evacuation call last night. It’s deeply distressing to hear that in these difficult times, some are making prank calls to Palestinians in Gaza, urging them to evacuate their homes in the middle of the night under the pretense of impending bombings.\\n   \\n      This has caused immense panic and fear for many families. Such actions are both heartless and unnecessary, particularly when thousands of homes have already been destroyed in Gaza.\\n   \\n      We once celebrated birthdays together, shared meals, laughed and forged cherished memories.\\xa0Yet today those memories lay in ruins, much like the places that were once our sanctuaries.\\n   \\n      My family, like countless others, is denied the simple privilege of reminiscing about better days as they endure another judgment day.\\n   \\n      My 71-year-old mother, surrounded by most of her children and their offspring, clings to the familial bond that keeps them together as they grapple with diminishing water supplies, and the oppressive cloak of darkness that accompanies a life without electricity.\\n   \\n      Their peculiar predicament places them in what is ironically deemed northern Gaza’s evacuation area, though escape remains a risky endeavor for many.\\n   \\n      The reasons for their inability to flee are multifaceted. The scarcity of fuel renders any vehicle moving in Gaza right now\\xa0—\\xa0let alone a car spacious enough to accommodate 20 people\\xa0—\\xa0a subject of suspicion. And venturing southward would lead them into unfamiliar territory, far from friends, family and the comforting familiarity of home. In a region where geography can determine life or death, this is a gamble few are willing to take.\\n   \\n      In a world where not even\\xa0my\\xa0colleagues adorned with the emblem of the UN are assured safety, the conundrum faced by civilians becomes a disquieting paradox.\\xa0How can ordinary Palestinians, like my family, be expected to find sanctuary when the lines between refuge and peril blur with each passing day?\\n   \\n      The struggles of the present serve as a testament to the unyielding spirit of the Palestinian people, a resilience that draws its strength from the painful memories of\\xa01948\\xa0when my grandparents fled for their lives, and\\xa01967\\xa0when our parents sought shelter within Gaza.\\n   \\n      These were times of similar adversity, times when our forebears endured and survived. The question that lingers, however, is why should their children and grandchildren be condemned to relive this ceaseless cycle of suffering?\\n   \\n      Looking back at those days, I have developed a deeper understanding of my relatives, who lived through the\\xa01948 Nakba\\xa0– and the uncertainty, the injustices, the powerlessness and the betrayal. Feelings instilled into a new generation of Palestinians who only grew up hearing stories\\xa0of their ethnic cleansing.\\n   \\n      Now the Palestinians in Gaza\\xa0are taking a trip down memory lane, with the realization in their march toward safety,\\xa0that\\xa0they are leaving behind places that they might as well never see again.\\n   \\n      The pain of loss and dispossession has been etched into our collective memory, serving as a somber and persistent reminder of our shared history.\\n   \\n      Earlier this week, I received a message from Amro, my 29-year-old nephew. Amro is fond of Gaza and staying there, despite having opportunities to travel and live outside of it.\\n   \\n      Amro made me promise that\\xa0if\\xa0he somehow survives this, I should help him find a way to leave Gaza forever. This was hard for me. Amro loved this coastal Mediterranean town, up until the most recent war.\\n   \\n      This essay serves as a heartfelt plea for understanding, compassion, and, above all, an urgent call for peace and the hope of a brighter future.\\n   \\n      Sadly, given the relentless duration of the crisis in Gaza, the prospects for such a future seem more elusive by the second.\\n  ',\n",

       " {'headline': '\\n      Opinion: Why student protests against Israel are so painful, polarizing and complicated\\n    ',\n",
       "  'contents': ' \\n  Editor’s Note: Nicole Hemmer is an associate professor of history and director of the Carolyn T. and Robert M. Rogers Center for the Study of the Presidency at Vanderbilt University. She is the author of\\xa0“Partisans: The Conservative Revolutionaries Who Remade American Politics in the 1990s”and cohosts the podcasts\\xa0“Past Present”\\xa0and\\xa0“This Day in Esoteric Political History.”\\xa0The views expressed in this commentary are her own. View more\\xa0opinion\\xa0on CNN.\\n \\n      As the situations in Israel and Gaza\\xa0grow more dire\\xa0— both for the Israeli hostages and\\xa0Gazans under bombardment — American discourse surrounding the growing crisis increasingly has locked in on one sliver of US life: the university. There have been plenty of opinion pieces in national outlets, with headlines like “The War Comes to Stanford” and “Students for Pogroms in Israel.”\\n   \\n      But there have also been more material criticisms. After several Harvard student groups announced that they “hold the Israeli regime entirely responsible for all unfolding violence” following the Hamas attack on the country that left at least 1,500 dead, billionaire hedge fund CEO Bill Ackman and others\\xa0called for the students’ names and details to be made publicly available in order\\xa0to blacklist them from future jobs — essentially also calling for them to be doxxed. A nonprofit founded by Victoria’s Secret billionaire Leslie Wexner, and his wife Abigail, announced that it was\\xa0breaking ties with Harvard, alleging the school has been “tiptoeing” over the Hamas’ attack.\\n   \\n      At the University of Pennsylvania, the Huntsman Foundation (led by former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman)\\xa0withdrew\\xa0its promised multimillion-dollar donations this week, arguing that the university’s delay in commenting on the attack amounted to “silence in the face of reprehensible and historic Hamas evil.” And as Huntsman, also a former ambassador and former Penn trustee, wrote in his email to Penn’s president, “silence is antisemitism.”\\n   \\n      Historical context matters here, because harsh reactions among the American establishment to college students and their political activism are not new to the current crisis. Student radicals have been targets of condemnation since at least the early 1960s, when they experimented with new forms of protest against anti-Black racism, the Vietnam War, poverty and censorship. “I think they oughta shoot ‘em if they’re carrying the Vietcong flag,” actor John Wayne\\xa0said of the protests.\\n   \\n      Though they were part of pivotal movements for social change, the students themselves wielded much less power than most other people in society — certainly less than politicians, business leaders and university presidents. So why do these students receive such outsized attention?\\n   \\n      In part, no doubt, it’s a question of fear: fear that a rising generation will fundamentally transform the country, rewriting its politics in ways that appall the people currently in power. That has yet to bear out in reality; the 1980s and 1990s, for instance, were not decades of left-wing radicalism by middle-aged Boomers (many of whom had fought the Vietnam War), but rather an era of marked conservatism in US politics. There were, of course, cultural changes, but on the political front, it would have been difficult to guess that, say, the Democratic Party that voted for the Iraq invasion in 2003 had, 30 years earlier, been torn apart by antiwar protesters opposed to US actions in Vietnam.\\n   \\n      It’s fair (and important) to note that the students being criticized now for their protests are by far in the minority of their peers,\\xa0in part because\\xa0social media and news outlets have highlighted the most incendiary and shocking voices, muting the more nuanced discussions that define many of the conversations and positions held by student activists.\\xa0But watching this all play out in recent days, it seems like there is a more important dynamic at play, a different lesson derived from the 1960s. People with real power have learned, over the decades and most acutely in the last few years, to use student protests and youth-driven radicalism as a political tool, pointing to the content of protests to delegitimize entire parties and movements.\\n   \\n      Students can be at times ham-fisted, doctrinaire, blinkered and strident in their protest. In the 1960s, student radicals\\xa0occasionally waved the Viet Cong flag to show solidarity with the people of Vietnam. Others flashed the Little Red Book of Mao Zedong, a Chinese leader whose policies led to millions of deaths. Such symbols became important touchstones for some students who were working to make sense of, and oppose, American imperialism, a political stance with few other outlets in the US (certainly\\xa0the two-party system had little to offer them).\\n   \\n      Such techniques also made students tempting targets at a time when US soldiers were dying in firefights with the Viet Cong, and when sympathy for the millions of Vietnamese killed or displaced by the war was hard to find. An\\xa0image of a student with a Viet Cong flag\\xa0allowed supporters of the war to argue that the entire antiwar movement was actually anti-American. As a bonus, the sight of such students made it easy to dismiss young people across the country, and leftism more broadly, as uninformed, unpatriotic and unworthy of support, without ever having to engage with the students’ critiques of American power.\\n   \\n      There was no need to engage, because the students themselves had little power of their own. Universities could, and\\xa0did,\\xa0suspend and expel\\xa0student protesters. Police could, and did,\\xa0brutalize and arrest\\xa0them. Political parties could, and did,\\xa0ignore and overrule them (although the Democratic Party would ultimately reform its practices to allow greater representation of young people, a reform that did not dramatically change the party’s politics in the years that followed).\\n   \\n      But students did have the power to disrupt,\\xa0to grab camera time and to create\\xa0the iconic imagery of an era. For that reason, it was easy to imagine they had far more power than they did, easy for people with actual power and material resources to imagine themselves to be victims of these students. President Richard Nixon invoked\\xa0the “silent majority” in 1969, suggesting that US politics had been hijacked by the unruly, unrepresentative protestors that dominated the nightly news, that patriotic Americans had to take their country back. President Ronald Reagan\\xa0railed against\\xa0student protestors as governor of California in the late 1960s, building himself a platform to eventually become president. The students may not have gotten their revolution, but conservative politicians found them useful for gaining power of their own.\\n   \\n      A similar dynamic appears alive and well today.\\xa0Students at a number of schools across the US have rallied for Palestinians, at times blaming Israel for Hamas’ attack as part of a broader denunciation of the treatment of Palestinians in Gaza.\\xa0Critics in particular\\xa0have called out\\xa0National Students for Justice in Palestine for its “day of resistance” that explicitly celebrated the attacks and sought to lay blame for the violence entirely on Israel.\\xa0That position is offensive for most, especially for fellow students who may rightly feel alienated or horrified by their colleagues’ efforts, but nothing coming from US universities has, at this point, moved the needle on national\\xa0support for Israel, which\\xa0appears to be strengthening.\\n   \\n      But it has earned many students swift retribution, in the form of\\xa0lost jobs, broad condemnation and the threat of industry blacklists. It has also been used to discredit the left more broadly. For some, that’s precisely the point. Christopher Rufo, a right-wing activist who has built a career on attacking universities (and for explaining in detail how he carries out his propaganda),\\xa0laid out his plan\\xa0on social media, arguing that, by connecting Hamas, Black Lives Matter, Democratic Socialists of America and academic discourse, the right can “attack, delegitimize and discredit” universities and the American left, turning them into “political untouchables.”\\n   \\n      Such a maneuver requires most Americans to believe that students have outsized power, that they have the potential to orchestrate the nation’s politics and so must be shut down at any costs by those who disagree with these students’ political causes.\\xa0That simply isn’t the case. You may hate these student activists’ words and actions, but they’re not the ones with the power here. We should be focused on the people who do have that power, and on how they’re using it.\\n  ',\n",

She is a weekly opinion contributor to CNN, a contributing columnist to The Washington Post and a columnist for World Politics Review. The views expressed in this commentary are her own. View\\xa0more opinion\\xa0on CNN.\\n \\n      Hours after Hamas terrorists launched their brutal rampage against Israeli civilians, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky\\xa0issued\\xa0a fierce defense of Israel and an unequivocal condemnation of Hamas.\\n   \\n      “Terror is always a crime, not just against country or specific victims, but against humanity as a whole,” he wrote.\\xa0Zelensky added that “Israel’s right to defense is beyond question”\\xa0—\\xa0and urged the world to\\xa0stand united against terror.\\n   \\n      A couple of days later, addressing NATO’s parliamentary assembly, where Ukraine had been a focus since Russia invaded it some 600 days ago,\\xa0Zelensky\\xa0noted the inescapable new reality facing his embattled country.\\n   \\n      “These days,\\xa0our attention is focused\\xa0on the Middle East,” he declared via video link. “No one can ever forget what terrorists did in Israel,” he said.\\n   \\n      Zelensky has steadfastly continued supporting Israel, despite his\\xa0often-tense relations with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, repeatedly drawing the connection between what Hamas did to Israel and what Russia has perpetrated against Ukraine, and its indiscriminate slaughter of Ukrainian civilians. He even urged NATO leaders to show their support by\\xa0traveling to Israel.\\n   \\n      While taking a principled stand, Zelensky — and the Ukrainian people — are fervently hoping that the world’s new security crisis, the eruption of a new war in the Middle East, will not become yet another obstacle in Ukraine’s efforts to push back against Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and Russian President Vladimir Putin’s aim to deny Ukraine’s right to exist as a sovereign country.\\n   \\n      Now, the war between Israel and Hamas, which started on October 7, Putin’s birthday, looks like a gift for the Russian autocrat, and prominent Russians are openly delighting in it.\\n   \\n      Putin, who has actively developed ties with Hamas in\\xa0recent years\\xa0called it “an\\xa0example of the failure\\xa0of United States policy in the Middle East.” Russian television programs ridiculed the US and Israel, and a high-ranking Russian diplomat boasted of how Russia would benefit from the conflict.\\n   \\n      In talks with regional leaders, Putin, whose forces’ attacks in Ukraine have left tens of of thousands\\xa0of civilian casualties, said he was worried about “a\\xa0catastrophic\\xa0increase in the number of civilian casualties.”\\n   \\n      Diplomat Konstantin Gavrilov told the Izevestia newspaper that the crisis would have a direct impact on the “special military operation” — Putin’s war against Ukraine. “Ukraine’s sponsors will be distracted by the conflict in Israel,” he said, and “the amount of military aid\\xa0will\\xa0go down.” As a result, he said, “the course of the operation\\xa0may turn sharply in [Russia’s] favor.”\\n   \\n      US officials have taken pains to deny that support for Ukraine will suffer as the US mobilizes to support Israel. President Joe Biden\\xa0says both wars are critical\\xa0to US security, and US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin assured NATO defense ministers that, “We can and will\\xa0stand by Israel, even as we stand by Ukraine.”\\n   \\n      That is clearly the Biden administration’s intention, but the\\xa0chaos in the Republican-held House\\xa0of Representatives makes appropriating money much more difficult, and GOP members, while strongly supportive of Israel, are divided about aid for Ukraine.\\n   \\n      That is yet another source of satisfaction for Putin and one of anxiety for Zelensky, as Ukraine’s forces prepare for winter combat\\xa0—\\xa0and civilians brace for another winter of Russian attacks.\\n   \\n      The potential benefits to Russia of the Hamas attacks on Israel are so evident, that some\\xa0are speculating\\xa0that Moscow\\xa0was involved, pointing to Russia’s strong ties with Iran — Hamas’ principal sponsor — to nearly half a dozen\\xa0visits to Moscow by top Hamas officials since 2020, to the fact that the attack happened on Putin’s birthday,\\xa0the same date that Russian journalist Anna Politkovskaya, one of Putin’s most effective critics, was assassinated in 2006, in\\xa0what some believe was a\\xa0birthday “gift” to Putin. (The Kremlin denies involvement.)\\n   \\n      Israel’s ambassador to Moscow told a local newspaper, “We do not believe that Russia was involved in any way.” The suggestion, said ambassador Alexander Ben Zvi, was “complete nonsense.”\\n   \\n      On Monday, while Israelis were still fighting Hamas elements inside the country, a Hamas official went on Russian television and highlighted Russia’s support. “They sympathize with us,” said Ali Baraka, head of Hamas National Relations Abroad, pointing to their\\xa0mutually beneficial relations. “Russia is happy that America is getting embroiled in the Palestine war,” he said. “It eases the pressure on the Russians in Ukraine … so we’re not alone on the battlefield.”\\n   \\n      Whoever had a hand in training, planning and carrying out Hamas’ attack in Israel — an attack in which they also killed dozens of\\xa0Ukrainian\\xa0and\\xa0Russian citizens\\xa0— there is no question that the escalating tensions in the Middle East, at least in the short run, are strongly favorable to Moscow’s campaign against Ukraine, and have created extremely serious new challenges for Kyiv.\\n   \\n      “Russia,” Zelensky wrote\\xa0two days after the attack, “is interested in triggering war in the Middle East, so that a new source of pain and suffering could\\xa0undermine world unity, increase discord and contradictions, and thus help Russia destroy freedom in Europe.”\\n   \\n      So far,\\xa0NATO has stood firmly\\xa0in support of Israel. But, just as the terrorists count on Israel’s response provoking a counter-reaction, stoking anti-Israel sentiment, Russia could also benefit if the public in NATO-member countries turns against Israel, and internal divisions bleed into NATO’s unity.\\n   \\n      Ukraine has enjoyed muscular support from the West, which was has been\\xa0unified\\xa0in its view that Russia started a war of conquest, clearly outside the bounds of international law and modern international norms.\\n   \\n      To defeat Russia, and to save Ukraine, Zelensky needs continued support, especially from the US, the country with the world’s largest, most powerful arsenal.\\n   \\n      The question is whether that arsenal, and the reservoir of good will for Ukraine, can withstand not only the dysfunction plaguing America’s Republican Party\\xa0— but also US\\xa0commitment to supporting Israel, by far its most important ally in what remains the world’s most volatile region, the Middle East.\\n   \\n      These\\xa0two wars, between Russia and Ukraine, and between Israel and Hamas, are very different. The circumstances of each conflict and their key figures are very different. But it’s remarkable that in both cases the side that launched the assault brazenly went after civilians in violation of the laws of war and attacked democratic countries — however flawed.\\n   \\n      And both — Hamas and Russia — have been run by autocratic leaders who\\xa0deny\\xa0their enemies’\\xa0right to live\\xa0in a sovereign country. That they are both allied with autocratic Iran, and have both amassed power by dismantling any semblance of democracy at home and even\\xa0killing their internal rivals. (They deny it, but the evidence is ample.)\\n   \\n      Another parallel is that these two conflicts have the potential to spread in catastrophic ways.\\n   \\n      And, in both cases, the side that was attacked — Israel and Ukraine — deserves continued support on the path to defeating enemies that undermine global stability.\\n  ',\n",

The views expressed in this commentary are his own. Read more CNN Opinion.\\n \\n      Twenty years ago this month, I was a young Marine lieutenant marching down a California street in an Iraq War victory parade. We had defeated Saddam Hussein and the Iraqi Army, and we thought it was all over.\\n   \\n      But of course, it was not. Twenty years later, American troops are still in Iraq.\\xa0\\n \\n      Israel is about to start an invasion of Gaza with the same mission we had in those early days in Iraq: defeat the enemy, or in Netanyahu’s words, “crush and eliminate” Hamas.\\n   \\n      But the lesson America quickly learned in Iraq and Afghanistan was that you have to have a plan for the day after. Outside the southern Iraqi city of Najaf during the invasion, then Colonel David Petraeus famously asked, “Tell me how this ends….”\\n \\n      The next year, I found myself in that same city Petraeus had conquered, trying to win it back. It was my second of what would become four tours in Iraq, facing far worse combat than we saw during the invasion.\\n   \\n      By that time, the insurgency was entrenched, much like Hamas is in Gaza today, and we had to fight, block by block, to root it out.\\n   \\n      One day in the summer of 2004 reminds me of how difficult this was and why you always have to consider what comes next.\\n   \\n      My company was called to rescue an Army Special Forces detachment from a school in which they took serious casualties. After we helped evacuate their wounded and dead, my Marines and I assaulted the building with a platoon of Recon Marines in support.\\n   \\n      But with insurgents throwing grenades from the roof and rolling them down the stairs, we took casualties ourselves, and I made the difficult decision to withdraw my platoon — and call in an air strike to level the building.\\n   \\n      It was the right decision to kill insurgents without losing more Marines, but leveling a school doesn’t win you a lot of hearts and minds. And this was just one building, a mere two stories tall, and we were fairly confident there were no civilians inside.\\n   \\n      Now look at Gaza by comparison: a city five times the size, with buildings ten times as high, and Hamas fighters using human shields -— including hostages from Israel, America, and other countries — at every turn.\\n   \\n      Then there’s the question of what comes next. After brutal weeks of battle in Najaf, our more complicated work began: winning over the rest of the Iraqi population so that peace could be permanent.\\n   \\n      That meant months of diligent, tedious work doing everything from creating jobs, to training the Iraqi Army, to rebuilding hundreds of buildings, like that school I destroyed with a 500-pound bomb, all the while keeping remaining pockets of the insurgency at bay.\\n   \\n      To be sure, there are some fundamental differences between Israel’s war with Hamas and America’s war in Iraq. Israel is responding to an attack from within by a terrorist organization seeking to wreak havoc in Israel and across the region. In contrast, a coalition of countries invaded Iraq seeking to displace a brutal dictator who we thought had weapons of mass destruction— and in the process, we created an insurgency.\\n   \\n      In one case, the insurgency was the cause of the conflict, and in the other, the insurgency was the result. But we nevertheless learned valuable lessons that Israel should take seriously. Countering an insurgency is Israel’s task in Gaza just as it was America’s challenge in Iraq and Afghanistan.\\n   \\n      Israel’s military victory in Gaza will be hard enough, but its government should explain their plan for the day after, a plan for the future of Gaza. If they simply kill a lot of Hamas terrorists and leave Gaza a smoldering mess, they’ll have the same problem they do today — much like America did after the first time we conquered Najaf.\\n   \\n      One of the reasons fighting terrorists is so much more difficult than fighting a regular army is that every minute we were in Najaf, whether during combat or reconstruction, we had to keep in mind that fundamental equation of counter-insurgency: You should never create more insurgents than you kill.\\n   \\n      Famed US general Stan McChrystal estimated that this “insurgent math” is ten to one: for every innocent person you kill, you create ten new enemies. So, let’s be generous to the Israeli Army and say that they kill 1,000 Hamas fighters in the first two weeks of brutal fighting, and only kill 150 civilians by accident in the process — generous odds given Hamas’ ruthless disregard for innocent lives. Well, Israel has just recruited 50% more insurgents than they’ve killed.\\n   \\n      This brings us back to the beginning of any counter-insurgency campaign, which General Petraeus describes as the first step in winning: you have to get the big ideas right.\\n   \\n      Israel’s leaders need to answer these big, difficult questions before subjecting more young lives, on both sides, to a brutal war:\\n   \\n\\xa0How will you define military victory? (You can’t recruit more insurgents than you kill.)\\n   \\nWhat is the exit strategy for your troops? (Your troops want to know.)\\n   \\nWhat is the sustainable, political solution for the Gaza Strip? (It can’t be returning to the status quo, which obviously hasn’t worked.)\\n   \\n      If Israeli leaders, from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu down, cannot answer these questions, they are plunging their young soldiers into another “forever war” like we created for ourselves in Iraq and Afghanistan.\\n   \\n      If they don’t have a durable civil-military endgame, they had better be prepared to explain to Israeli parents, 20 years from now, what their kids died to achieve.\\n   \\n      Our First Marine Division motto in Iraq, under General Mattis, was “no better friend, no worse enemy.” I want Hamas to know no greater enemy than the Israeli Army, and I want to see every Hamas fighter defeated.\\n   \\n      But if Israel can’t prove the first part, too — that “if you work with us, you will find no greater friend” — then we will soon see plenty of new Hamas terrorists taking the places of those who are killed.\\n   \\n      There are a lot of peace-loving Palestinians in Gaza who loathe Hamas, but it’s up to the Israeli Army to prove themselves better friends.\\n   \\n      I hope Israel succeeds against enormous odds, but they have to have a better plan than simply killing a lot of people.\\n   \\n      Nobody wants to see five-year-old Palestinian kids killed in the crossfire with Hamas, especially if their deaths only recruit more terrorists.\\n   \\n      And nobody wants to see five-year-old Israeli kids dying, in the same forever war, 20 years from today.\\n  ',\n",

An\\xa0open dash into the hospital where I was triaging the sick and injured for evacuation.\\n   \\n      Again, the\\xa0huge Red Cross flag on\\xa0the hospital roof\\xa0did not stop our windows shattering into lethal shards that killed several around me. We were not the target\\xa0– but we were\\xa0in the way of artillery from a neighboring hilltop.\\n   \\n      The\\xa0siege of Sarajevo in the 1990s was my first exposure to urbanized warfare. It was to be followed with others in cities as\\xa0far-flung as Kabul and Kigali, Huambo and Goma.\\n   \\n      All of which come to mind as some 2.3 million residents of Gaza –\\xa0living in one of the most densely-packed places in the Middle East\\xa0–\\xa0endure\\xa0Israeli bombardment and siege,\\xa0in response to\\xa0massacres by Hamas.\\xa0\\n \\n      Elsewhere\\xa0across the globe, the bloodshed continues. There\\xa0are daily Russian attacks on Ukrainian cities, epitomized by the\\xa090% destruction of Mariupol. Sudan’s internal war has turned\\xa0Khartoum into a living nightmare, and gangs in Port-au-Prince\\xa0have created their own hell.\\n   \\n      Wars in cities are not new.\\xa0Jerusalem, by some estimates,\\xa0has been attacked 52 times, besieged 23 times and destroyed twice over its long history. Britain and Germany pulverized each other’s cities in the Second World War while its most brutal\\xa0battle over Stalingrad\\xa0became stuff for movies. Beirut is still scarred by\\xa0Lebanon’s civil war.\\n   \\n      However, modern urban warfare sets new records of ruination because\\xa0more than half\\xa0of us\\xa0live in built-up areas.\\xa0Cities\\xa0generate\\xa080% of global GDP. Urban lifestyles depend completely on infrastructure for energy, water, healthcare, food supply, transport and communications.\\n   \\n      Therefore, disrupting, destroying or controlling cities is central to war-making.\\n   \\n      This is not illegal under the UN Charter but the concept of\\xa0’just’ war\\xa0in international law requires protecting non-combatants.\\n   \\nIn urban war, fighters and civilians intermingle\\n \\n      Often, the frontlines of urban conflicts cannot be clearly demarcated when fighters and civilians are intermingled.\\xa0Protecting the latter is easier said than done amidst the general pandemonium. Besides, civilians – whether politicians and strategists, or cheerleaders on the sidelines – are implicated\\xa0in wars, directly or indirectly.\\n   \\n      Also,\\xa0in the digital era of intelligence-led cyber warfare, distinctions between civilian and combatant is lost. As words are powerful weapons to provoke or disinform the other side, social media warriors proliferate.\\n   \\n      Such belligerents are not at physical frontlines in military uniforms. They direct armed drones or unleash destructive computer viruses from nondescript apartments in ordinary communities.\\n   \\n      Then there are activists and agitators\\xa0seeking media attention\\xa0to rally support or embarrass the enemy in the court of public opinion.\\n   \\nWar has changed since the Geneva Conventions\\xa0\\n \\n      These new-style warriors were unknown when the\\xa0Geneva Conventions\\xa0emerged over a century ago. In today’s whole-of-society conflicts, unarmed, non-uniformed combatants are unlikely to be accorded the traditional Geneva protections. Prevailing geopolitical fractures make it impossible to agree to\\xa0new conventions.\\n   \\n      So, when, for instance, Russian missiles hit residential blocks in Ukraine,\\xa0which may host\\xa0drone assembly,\\xa0or Israeli jets demolish Gaza buildings with\\xa0Hamas tunnels\\xa0underneath them, the understandable outrage over the collateral killing of innocents could be equally directed towards those waging conflicts under civilian cover.\\n   \\nExplosive weapons in urban settings\\xa0\\n \\n      The problem with rules prohibiting the disproportionate use of force is with titrating the violence. Over the decades,\\xa0technology has improved targeting precision, but not at the pace of development of more powerful munitions with wide-area effects.\\n   \\n      These\\xa0types of explosive weapons\\xa0were designed for traditional open battlefields and cause ferocious indiscriminate impact when unleashed in built environments.\\n   \\n      That violates international humanitarian law and is contrary to a\\xa0UN political declaration\\xa0on explosive weapons in populated areas.\\n   \\n      However, with fast-moving multiple targets in a chaotic cityscape,\\xa0overwhelming force to achieve a quicker victory has compelling, if perverse, logic:\\xa0to prevent the considerably greater casualties that occur in protracted warfare.\\xa0Especially in asymmetrical conflicts where militias such as Islamic State and Hamas\\xa0prefer the tactics of drawn-out violent attrition with even less respect for the rules of war.\\n   \\n      Surgical strikes\\xa0aimed at military targets with intent to minimize collateral damage to the surrounds\\xa0are theoretically feasible. But mistakes often happen as with hospitals hit in\\xa0Afghanistan\\xa0and\\xa0Yemen.\\n   \\nProsecution for war crimes a rarity\\xa0\\n \\n      Besides, who is doing the reckoning for war crimes? This is so rare that when\\xa0Britain\\xa0and\\xa0Australia\\xa0prosecute their soldiers for excesses in Iraq and Afghanistan, it makes headlines. Justice via the International Criminal Court is so slow that it makes no practical difference to ongoing wars. Thus, impunity rules.\\n   \\n      Meanwhile, humanitarians are increasingly in the crossfire. Partly because trust is at an all-time low with\\xa0the same\\xa0nations funding aid as those providing the weapons to hurt. Humanitarian agencies struggle with neutrality and impartiality when coerced by one side or other. Aid is often a tool of war to be looted or diverted as in\\xa0Ethiopia\\xa0and\\xa0Somalia.\\n \\n      Strong values-driven agencies such as the International Committee of the Red Cross and UN World Food Program struggle in Ukraine, Sudan and countless other places to balance principles with pragmatism. When they compromise to access those in desperate need, as in\\xa0Syria\\xa0or\\xa0Libya, criticism is usual. That will also come in Gaza if humanitarian pauses and corridors are allowed.\\n   \\nThe dilemma at the heart of urban warfare\\xa0\\n \\n      What can urbanites do in such impossible circumstances? There is much talk of resilience, but this has limits when stockpiles do not outlast increasingly lengthy blockades as Gazans know, and safe rooms and bunkers cannot withstand direct assaults as Israelis discovered.\\n   \\n      In 2021, after\\xa0previous tensions\\xa0around the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem,\\xa0at least 250 people in Gaza and 13 in Israel, died in 11 days of targeted Israeli air raids on Gaza. That figure was quickly eclipsed by this latest round of less-restrained bombardments. The final toll will be much greater. In truth, there are no good ways to conduct urban wars – but short ones are\\xa0preferable.\\xa0Unfortunately, that makes for high intensity warfare and heavy casualties\\n   \\n      In Gaza, it means wishing success to external peacemakers. And courage to Gazan\\xa0residents to\\xa0resist the fanatic Hamas amidst them. Both the just Palestinian cause and Israel’s rightful security will benefit.\\n  ',\n",

       "  'contents': ' \\nEditor’s note:\\xa0Yasmine Mohammed is the author of\\xa0“Unveiled: How Western Liberals Empower Radical Islam.” She is also the president of the nonprofit organization\\xa0Free Hearts Free Minds.\\xa0The views expressed in this commentary are her own. Read more opinion on CNN.\\xa0\\n \\n      When my father, who was born and raised in Gaza, was still alive, he often spoke out against Hamas, calling it the ugly face of the Palestinian struggle everywhere.\\n   \\n      Since Hamas’ attack on Israel, as I have read post after post on social media referring to Hamas as freedom fighters\\xa0involved in anti-colonial resistance, I have been struck by the devastating weight of this lie. It is an insult to Palestinians to refer to these terrorists as our freedom fighters.\\n   \\n      At the hands of Hamas, the Jewish people have endured horrors\\xa0not seen since the Holocaust. And, like the Nazis, Hamas does not view Jewish people as human beings. According to its 1988 covenant, every Jew must be eradicated from this earth.\\xa0Its goal is not the genocide of Jewish people in Israel; its goal is the genocide of all Jewish people on this planet, period.\\n   \\n      My father\\u202fhated that Hamas had dominated the conversation and positioned itself as the face of Gaza worldwide.\\xa0My dad\\u202fwas born and raised in the Gaza Strip and lived there until he went to Egypt to attend university. Although he left Egypt for San Francisco and later moved to Montreal, he always carried Gaza in his heart.\\n   \\n      He had a Facebook page and a YouTube channel dedicated to sharing images and videos of a Gaza before it was overrun with terrorists. There is nothing he hated more than Hamas.\\u202fIn words he posted to social media:\\xa0“May God curse the Muslim Brotherhood and Hamas, they have brought us nothing but backwardness in our Arab societies.”\\n   \\n      He would not be surprised to see the massacres of families, of babies, of the elderly by Hamas because he knew its brutality already. Like many people from Gaza, my father knew that if you spoke up against these\\xa0tyrannical oppressors, you were swiftly dealt with. And your family, too, for good measure. Hamas has never shied away from violence.\\n   \\n      To throw all Gazans in the same bucket as Hamas is a grave insult — one that people on both sides of the political spectrum are committing.\\n   \\n      Many people on the left, for example, conflate Hamas with all Palestinians and then deem them all the oppressed\\xa0— the minority group, the victims, the besieged.\\u202fHamas is happy with this misguided and confused perspective because it allows the group to hide under the umbrella of “oppression”\\xa0to justify its violence.\\u202fIt would rather, of course, be seen as freedom fighters than terrorists.\\n   \\n      Among the hard right, many people are conflating Palestinians with Hamas\\xa0to justify the flattening of Gaza. While cutting power and water to civilians violates international law, cutting water and electricity to terrorists is justified, according to that line of thinking.\\n   \\n      The truth is, Hamas is not Gaza, and Gaza is not Hamas. Gaza is an area of land with people who are trying to do the best that they can to survive under abysmal circumstances. Gazans are just human beings, like their Israeli neighbors. They want to live in a peaceful environment where they do not have to be concerned about the safety of their children. While there are many Gazans who say they support Hamas, a poll conducted in July showed that 50% of Gazans agreed\\xa0that “Hamas should stop calling for Israel’s destruction, and instead accept a permanent two-state solution based on the 1967 borders.”\\n   \\n      Hamas stands next to al Qaeda and ISIS in perpetuating deadly terror attacks against civilians.\\u202fI believe Israel has every right to protect its people from a vicious, violent and ugly terrorist group. Jewish history is fraught, with generation after generation having to face various groups wanting to eradicate the Jewish population.\\n   \\n      I am heartbroken, of course, that Gazans will now have to pay the price for Hamas’ depravity. It is brutal and horrific. War always is. It was also brutal and horrific when al Qaeda was responsible\\xa0for the loss of so many Iraqi lives or when ISIS was responsible\\xa0for the loss of so many Syrian lives.\\n   \\n      Sadly, Hamas will likely continue its destruction. Its funding will still flow in from Iran, though perhaps it will need to rebrand under a different name. Like the mythic Hydra, it will grow two heads when this one is cut off. It is Gazans who will never recover. It is Gazans who will have to give up on their dream of a homeland forever.\\n   \\n      If you want to help Gazans, conflating them all with a terrorist group is not the way. Instead, you can help them to get out from under the tyranny of Hamas. Share the voices of peace-loving Palestinians such as activist Bassem Eid. Elevate the words of secular politicians who do not use religion to sow division and encourage hate of the other.\\n   \\n      I fear none of us will ever get to see Gaza as an independent state freed from the clutches of terrorists. I will never see my family’s two buildings there that my father so desperately wanted me to visit. They probably won’t be left standing. I will likely never set eyes on his beloved olive trees. They will return to the earth as he has.\\n   \\n      It could have been so different. Ignorance and religious zealotry ripped away any chance that Gaza had. Mercifully, my dad died thinking that one day his dream of freeing his homeland from the clutches of Hamas so the Gazan people could breathe and flourish might be realized. He didn’t have to endure the heartbreak of seeing the reality playing out today.\\n   \\n      When my dad died, I mourned mostly for what could have been in my relationship with him.\\u202fNow I\\u202fam mourning for what could have been for his homeland.\\xa0\\xa0\\n',\n",

       " {'headline': '\\n      The 10 Senate seats most likely to flip in 2024\\n    ',\n",
       "  'contents': ' \\n      While events on the other side of the world – and the other end of the US Capitol – have dominated recent news, the race for control of the Senate is a crucial factor in what Washington could look like after next year’s elections. \\n   \\n      The 2024 Senate map is advantageous for Republicans as they try to pick up the one or two seats needed to flip the chamber, depending on who wins the White House next year. Members of the Senate Democratic Caucus are defending the most competitive seats – the top eight on this list of 10 seats most likely to flip – which is not likely to change ahead of November 2024.  \\n   \\n      The order of the ranking, however, is changing. (Rankings are based on CNN’s reporting, fundraising figures and historical data about how states and candidates have performed.) Pennsylvania, for example, shoots up from No. 7 in July to No. 4 this month – in large part because it’s the one battleground where Republicans aren’t facing a messy primary. \\n   \\n      GOP candidate fields elsewhere have only grown over the past couple of months, despite the National Republican Senatorial Committee’s new policy of taking sides in primaries. Besides Pennsylvania, the national party has made its preference known for specific candidates in West Virginia, Montana, Nevada and Michigan. The NRSC is neutral in Ohio’s crowded primary and hasn’t ruled out endorsing in Arizona.  \\n   \\n      Whether engaging in primaries early on will pay off remains to be seen. So far, however, NRSC Chairman Steve Daines’ tactic of keeping Donald Trump close appears to be working, as the former president hasn’t yet endorsed against any of the campaign committee’s picks. \\n   \\n      The GOP presidential front-runner – with his four criminal indictments – is likely to be a liability in some places next year if he is the party’s nominee. But Republicans take comfort in the fact that he won the top three states on this list handily in 2020 and red-state Democrats will have to run with an unpopular President Joe Biden atop the ticket. In an era of increasingly nationalized politics, it’s becoming harder to run for Senate in a state that voted for the opposite party’s presidential nominee. In Democrats’ favor, however, Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, Jon Tester of Montana and Sherrod Brown of Ohio have succeeded at it before.  \\n   \\n      Vulnerable Democratic senators will try to distance themselves from Biden where they can or try to signal that they represent a check on the White House. For example, six of them (plus independent Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, who caucuses with Democrats) recently joined a bipartisan call to the secretary of state to freeze $6 billion in Iranian assets after Hamas’ attack on Israel – even though the administration has made clear that the money hasn’t been touched, has strict restrictions around it and the US hasn’t found a direct link between Iran and the Hamas attack. \\n   \\n      It’s too early to say whether current events – especially abroad – could have any impact on elections that are still over a year away, but with the GOP-led House paralyzed without a speaker and Congress being called upon to approve aid to Israel and Ukraine, the moment has underscored how congressional contests have very real consequences. \\n   \\n      Here’s where things stand in the race for the Senate just over a year before Election Day 2024: \\n   \\nIncumbent: Democrat Joe Manchin\\n \\n      West Virginia remains the seat most likely to change party hands next year, whatever Sen. Joe Manchin does. The most conservative Democrat in the Senate – who hasn’t ruled out running as an independent for reelection or for president – Manchin isn’t expected to announce his plans until the end of this year. He raised $715,000 in the July-to-September third quarter – enough to maintain appearances that he’ll be a candidate next year. The haul is also more than what either of his major GOP opponents raised but about half a million less than his previous quarter total. (The chances of this seat flipping only go up if Manchin declines to seek a third full term.)  \\n   \\n      Even if he runs without the “D” after his name, he’ll have an uphill battle in a state Trump won by 39 points in 2020. His vulnerability is apparent in the way GOP-affiliated ads are tying him to Biden and Democratic-aligned spots are tying him to Trump. One Nation, for example, has attacked him over his support of Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act, while Duty and Honor PAC has touted Manchin’s work with Trump to protect miners’ pensions.  \\n   \\n      The immediate fight, however, is the GOP primary, where Jim Justice, the popular Democrat-turned-Republican governor, has outraised Rep. Alex Mooney by about $300,000. While national Republicans and Trump are behind Justice, the Club for Growth and an allied super PAC have committed nearly $13.6 million to the House Freedom Caucus member. The club’s political arm is airing ads calling Justice a RINO, or Republican in Name Only, and trying to tie him to Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell.  \\n   \\nIncumbent: Democrat Jon Tester\\n \\n      Sen. Jon Tester, another red-state Democrat, is no stranger to tough races. But the most pressing question is whether GOP Rep. Matt Rosendale – fresh off his vote to oust House Speaker Kevin McCarthy – decides to complicate national Republicans’ plans by mounting his own bid to avenge his 2018 loss to Tester. The NRSC likes retired Navy SEAL Tim Sheehy, who already has the backing of the two other members of Montana’s congressional delegation (including Daines, the NRSC chairman) and Gov. Greg Gianforte. Sheehy, who entered the race in July, raised $2.9 million in the most recent fundraising quarter (including about $653,000 in personal money), but he’s a relative newcomer. (The Minnesota native has taken heat, for example, for saying in a Breitbart News interview that there were more bears than people in Montana.)  \\n   \\n      Rosendale, too, has out-of-state roots, and his House campaign only brought in about $335,000 during the third quarter. But as a previous statewide candidate – he was elected state auditor in 2016 and lost to Tester by about 4 points in 2018 – he starts with more built-in name recognition than Sheehy and could potentially benefit from assistance from the Club for Growth. Sheehy has been on air trying to introduce himself, leaning heavily into his military service and using ranching motifs to highlight his ties to the state. He’s also been attacking Tester for not adhering to some of the commitments in an ethics pledge he ran on during his first campaign, as CNN’s KFile reported.  \\n   \\n      An outside group called Last Best Place PAC, seemingly linked to Democrats, is attacking Sheehy – a sign Democrats may think he’d be a tougher opponent than Rosendale. Tester appears to be taking the race seriously – he raised more than $5 million in the third quarter and ended September with $13 million. \\n   \\nIncumbent: Democrat Sherrod Brown\\n \\n      Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown is gearing up for a tough race in a state that’s been trending red over the past decade. (He raised $5.8 million in the third quarter, ending the period with $11.2 million.) He’ll need all the money he can get if he faces one of the two self-funders vying for the GOP nomination. Both businessman Bernie Moreno and state Sen. Matt Dolan loaned their campaigns $3 million in the third quarter. Secretary of State Frank LaRose – who raised about $1 million, including $250,000 he loaned his campaign – doesn’t have the same kinds of personal resources, but he likely starts with a name ID advantage as the only statewide elected official in the GOP race. He became the public face of an August ballot effort to raise the threshold for amending the state constitution – seen as a proxy fight over an upcoming November referendum on abortion rights. LaRose admitted the measure was effectively about abortion, so the effort’s failure has been a point of attack from his primary opponents.  \\n   \\n      Trump carried Ohio twice, and his backing proved instrumental in getting now-Sen. JD Vance over the finish line in last year’s Republican primary, which also featured Dolan and, briefly, Moreno. Vance is backing Moreno in this primary, and while Trump has praised Moreno, he hasn’t made any endorsement yet. The NRSC is so far staying neutral in this race. The candidates met for their first forum last weekend, where US aid to Ukraine was a point of divergence between Moreno – who, like Vance, wants to suspend it – and Dolan, who wants it to continue. (LaRose called for making aid contingent on securing the US southern border.)  \\n   \\n      Meanwhile, Brown has been on the picket line with striking United Auto Workers – underscoring the economic populist streak that Democrats hope will allow him to defy the political tilt of his state once again.  \\n   \\nIncumbent: Democrat Bob Casey\\n \\n      The Keystone State moves up several spots this month largely because of how uniquely settled the GOP primary is compared with other battleground states. Republicans coalesced around Dave McCormick to take on Democratic Sen. Bob Casey soon after the former hedge fund executive got into the race in late September. (State Sen. Doug Mastriano announced in May that he was passing on a bid – a major relief for national Republicans who were wary of the failed 2022 gubernatorial candidate and election denier.)  \\n   \\n      But Democrats think McCormick, who unsuccessfully sought the state’s other Senate seat last year, has his own baggage. He tried to tack to the right in an effort to secure Trump’s endorsement and the GOP nomination in the 2022 Senate primary, which could alienate some suburban Philadelphia voters in a general election. He’s also facing questions about his residency. McCormick insists that he lives in Pennsylvania but returns to Connecticut to visit his daughter, who’s still in school there and lives with his ex-wife. “And if there’s a political cost associated with that, so be it,” he recently told ABC27’s “This Week in Pennsylvania.”\\n \\n      Still, the combination of McCormick and his vast personal resources during a presidential year are likely to make this Casey’s most competitive Senate race yet. The three-term incumbent, who raised $3.2 million in the third quarter, has a well-known political name in the state and enjoys a 48% job approval (and 31% disapproval) rating, according to a Quinnipiac University poll released earlier this month. He led McCormick 50% to 44% among registered voters in that survey, but this race is still young.  \\n   \\nIncumbent: Independent Kyrsten Sinema\\n \\n      Kari Lake – who embraced election denialism and conspiracy theories in her losing 2022 gubernatorial bid – was far from Republicans’ dream Senate candidate in this emerging purple state. But the former TV anchor is going to be hard to beat in a primary given her strong connection with the GOP base. Trump endorsed her by video at her announcement rally earlier this month, and there are signs that the party establishment is trying to keep her close. “We have not ruled out endorsing Lake,” a source familiar with the NRSC’s strategy told CNN. Daines has said the national party has had “productive conversations” with Lake, who recently told The Associated Press she’d vote for McConnell for leader. She’s also picked up the backing of Senate GOP Conference Chairman John Barrasso.  \\n   \\n      But Lake still won’t admit she lost last year’s gubernatorial race and her past hard-line positions on abortion could turn off swing voters. Her candidacy represents a familiar challenge for Arizona Republicans, whose recent nominees for key offices swung right in the primary and then struggled to pivot to the general election. Pinal County Sheriff Mark Lamb is also running for Senate, but raised just $475,000 in the third quarter.  \\n   \\n      The race will remain unsettled, however, until Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, who left the Democratic Party to become an independent last year, announces whether she’s running. Her $825,000 haul in the third quarter raised questions about her future, given that it was less than what she’s raised in the past. But Sinema still had more than $10 million in the bank as of September 30. Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego, meanwhile, outraised her yet again – bringing in $3.1 million last quarter – but had about half of her cash on hand.  \\n   \\nIncumbent: Democrat Jacky Rosen\\n \\n      Nevada is a slightly more Democratic state than most on this list, although that’s not saying much. It voted for Biden by about 2 points, so Democrats aren’t taking Sen. Jacky Rosen’s reelection for granted. She raised $2.7 million in the third quarter, ending with $8.8 million in the bank.  \\n   \\n      National Republicans have made clear their preference for retired Army Capt. Sam Brown, an unsuccessful 2022 Senate candidate who’s trying to tie Rosen to Biden and his economic policies. But that hasn’t winnowed the GOP field. Trump’s former ambassador to Iceland, Jeff Gunter, entered the race in August and has cut an ad that refers to him as “110% pro-Trump.” Retired Air Force Lt. Col. Tony Grady, who lost a GOP primary bid for lieutenant governor last year, also jumped into the race in August. Former state Assemblyman Jim Marchant, an election denier and the losing 2022 GOP nominee for Nevada secretary of state, only raised $74,000 last quarter, compared with $1.2 million for Brown. \\n   \\n      The primary isn’t until June, but Democrats are already seizing on what they see as vulnerabilities in Brown’s abortion positioning, including comments he made during a 2014 run for the Texas state legislature and his past work with the Nevada Faith and Freedom Coalition.  \\n   \\nIncumbent: Democrat Tammy Baldwin\\n \\n      Wisconsin slides down one spot on this list, in part because Republicans still don’t have a major candidate to take on Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin. That doesn’t mean this race won’t eventually be very competitive in a battleground presidential state that swung from Trump to Biden in 2020.  \\n   \\n      Republicans are eyeing businessman and 2012 Senate candidate Eric Hovde, who would likely have the ability to self-fund. Baldwin raised $3.1 million during the third quarter and began October with about $6.9 million in the bank. This is one of the few states where presidential performance isn’t necessarily indicative of Senate race outcomes. GOP Sen. Ron Johnson, for example, won a third term last year after Biden had carried the state, albeit by only about half a point, two years earlier.  \\n   \\nIncumbent: Democrat Debbie Stabenow (retiring)\\n \\n      Michigan is a bluer state than its Midwestern neighbor Wisconsin – Biden carried the Wolverine State by nearly 3 points and Democrats saw success up and down the ticket in 2022, in part because abortion was such a galvanizing issue. Democrats are now trying to ensure that retiring Sen. Debbie Stabenow’s seat remains in their hands. Much of the party has coalesced around Rep. Elissa Slotkin, who raised nearly $3 million in the third quarter, although she does face primary challenges, including from actor Hill Harper, who raised about $559,000 and kicked in about $463,000 more of his own money.  \\n   \\n      Republicans landed a prominent recruit in former Rep. Mike Rogers, who succeeded Stabenow in the House and represented an earlier version of Slotkin’s Lansing-area seat for seven terms. Rogers, who raised $824,00 in the third quarter after entering the race in September, earned immediate praise from the NRSC as the “type of candidate who can perform well with suburban Michiganders.” And although the former House Intelligence chairman may use his recent absence from elected politics as a selling point, the GOP has changed a lot since he left Congress in 2015 – especially in Michigan, where the state party has a controversial new chair.  \\n   \\n      Since entering the race, Rogers has already landed a primary challenge from former Detroit Police Chief James Craig, who was disqualified from last year’s governor’s race over signature issues. Former Rep. Peter Meijer, who has formed an exploratory committee, could still run – although the one-term congressman isn’t likely to curry much favor with the GOP base after voting to impeach Trump in 2021.  \\n   \\nIncumbent: Republican Ted Cruz\\n \\n      Texas is a hard state for Democrats to flip – they haven’t won a statewide election here since 1994, their longest losing streak in the country. But GOP Sen. Ted Cruz makes a good villain for national Democrat donors. (See Beto O’Rourke’s massive 2018 fundraising hauls in his closer-than-expected loss to the senator.)  \\n   \\n      The question, however, is whether that grassroots Democratic opposition to Cruz can translate widely enough to deny him a third term. Democratic Rep. Colin Allred, who has already proved to be a strong fundraiser, brought in $4.7 million in the third quarter – more than Cruz’s $3.1 million. Democrats tout the former NFL player’s background as a good fit for Texas – he first won election to the House by flipping a GOP-held district in the Dallas area and has previously won support from the US Chamber of Commerce.  \\n   \\n      But although Allred already appears focused on Cruz, he’ll have to get through a crowded primary first. Among the other candidates is state Sen. Roland Guttierez, who represents Uvalde and raised $632,000 in the third quarter.  \\n   \\nIncumbent: Republican Rick Scott\\n \\n      Former Democratic Rep. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell announced her campaign to take on GOP Sen. Rick Scott in late August. Despite only being in the race for part of the third quarter, she narrowly outraised the first-term senator and former governor – $1.5 million to $1.4 million. Scott gave his campaign an additional $154,000 of his own money, and there’s plenty more where that came from for the wealthy former health care CEO.  \\n   \\n      Florida has been trending red in recent years – Trump carried the state by about 3 points in 2020, nearly tripling his margin from four years earlier. But each of Scott’s races for governor and Senate have been relatively close, and he’s never run in a presidential year. Democrats have targeted him over some of his more unpopular policy proposals – such as a sunset provision for all federal programs, which he later revised to exclude Social Security and Medicare after criticism from within his own party. The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, for example, has been running digital ads casting Scott and Cruz as threats to popular entitlement programs.  \\n   \\n      Even with Democratic investment, though, it’s going to take a lot to flip this seat blue. The state’s senior senator, Republican Marco Rubio, won reelection last year over a high-profile Democratic opponent by 16 points.  \\n  ',\n",

       "  'contents': ' \\n  Editor’s Note: Sign up\\xa0to get this weekly column as a newsletter. We’re looking back at the strongest, smartest\\xa0opinion takes\\xa0of the week from CNN and other outlets.\\n \\n      It was the speech President Franklin D. Roosevelt never gave. In a radio address scheduled for April 13, 1945, the fourth-term president would have said, “If civilization is to survive, we must cultivate the science of human relationships — the ability of all peoples, of all kinds, to live together and work together, in the same world, at peace.”\\n   \\n      But the day before, Roosevelt was sitting for a portrait at his cottage in Warm Springs, Georgia, when he suddenly slumped in his chair, the victim of a stroke. He didn’t live to see the allies’ victory in World War II that year or the conference in San Francisco that month that established the United Nations.\\n   \\n      Roosevelt originally conceived of the UN as a muscular force to keep the peace, with the United States, Soviet Union, United Kingdom and China acting as “four policemen” to rein in nations that would otherwise go to war. He wanted, in the words of the undelivered April 13 speech, “an end, forever, to this impractical, unrealistic settlement of the differences between governments by the mass killing of peoples.”\\n   \\n      The world in 2023 is a much different place, but peace, as Roosevelt envisioned it, remains elusive. A two-week-old conflict in the Middle East has already claimed thousands of lives against the backdrop of a multipolar web of alliances and rivalries in which the world’s major powers often lack the ability to restrain conflict, and sometimes even encourage it.\\n   \\n      On Thursday evening, though, President Joe Biden, who was a toddler when FDR died, sounded a Rooseveltian tone in asserting that the US still bears a special responsibility for seeking to promote world peace. He proposed billions in new aid to both Ukraine and Israel.\\n   \\n      “We’re facing an inflection point in history — one of the moments where the decisions we make today are going to determine the future for decades to come,” Biden argued. “American leadership is what holds the world together. American alliances are what keep us, America, safe.”\\n   \\n      Biden spoke just after returning from a trip to Israel to demonstrate support for an ally mourning the loss of more than 1,400 people in the October 7 Hamas terrorist attack. But his diplomatic efforts to meet with Arab leaders came undone after a devastating explosion at a hospital in Gaza. While Israel released evidence that the blast resulted from a rocket misfired by militants in Gaza and US officials signaled agreement, that did not tame the fury of the Palestinians and their supporters in the region.\\n   \\n      What’s next?\\n   \\nSeth Moulton, a Marine Corps veteran and a Democratic congressman from Massachusetts, says there are urgent lessons from America’s 2003 war in Iraq.\\n   \\n      “Israel is about to start an invasion of Gaza with the same mission we had in those early days in Iraq: defeat the enemy, or in Netanyahu’s words,\\xa0‘crush and eliminate’ Hamas.”\\n   \\n      “But the lesson America quickly learned in Iraq and Afghanistan was that you have to have a plan for the day after. Outside the southern Iraqi city of Najaf during the invasion, then Colonel David Petraeus famously asked,\\xa0‘Tell me how this ends….’”\\n   \\n      “The next year, I found myself in that same city Petraeus had conquered, trying to win it back. It was my second of what would become four tours in Iraq, facing far worse combat than we saw during the invasion.”\\n   \\n      The origins of the two wars are very different, Moulton pointed out, but there is the commonality that in a war with insurgents, some tactics can backfire.\\n   \\n      “Nobody wants to see five-year-old Palestinian kids killed in the crossfire with Hamas, especially if their deaths only recruit more terrorists.”\\n   \\n      “And nobody wants to see five-year-old Israeli kids dying, in the same forever war, 20 years from today.”\\n   \\n      Israeli analyst Shmuel Rosner observed that “Israel says its goal is toppling Hamas, and Biden is no doubt asking: What comes later? Biden himself initially\\xa0supported the US 2003 war in Iraq\\xa0only to end up as the president who ordered the US pullout of Afghanistan. In the 20 years in between, he witnessed the two countries that the US invaded struggle to transform their leadership from one government to another. He is familiar with the cost involved, the chaos, the bloodshed… he surely wants to see a convincing answer to the question of the day after.”\\n   \\n      Biden’s trip to Israel and Oval Office speech “show\\xa0a confident, experienced commander-in-chief projecting gravitas and a deep knowledge of history,” according to David Mark. “Biden’s efforts stand out even more than usual since his likely 2024 Republican opponent, former President Donald Trump, has been clumsy and ineffective in trying to insert himself into these news events, as when he\\xa0praised Hezbollah, the Iran-backed terror group\\xa0based in Lebanon, in the wake of Hamas’ attack on Israel. At the same time, the Republicans in office are in disarray as an increasingly embarrassing Republican leadership struggle in the House has paralyzed Capitol Hill.”\\n   \\nHani Almadhoun, who grew up in the Gaza Strip, now lives in the US and works as director of philanthropy at the\\xa0United Nations Relief and Works Agency USA.\\xa0“In the northern reaches of Gaza,” he wrote, “over 20 members of my extended family seek shelter under the refuge of a staircase\\xa0—\\xa0a frail shield against the relentless and merciless storm of airstrikes.”\\n   \\n      “They tread cautiously, avoiding windows and the desolate streets where the overwhelming stench of death, fire and chaos hangs heavy in the air…”\\n   \\n      “The negative impact of this war on my family in Gaza is hard to overstate: hospitals running out of space for the dead and injured, pushing the local hospitals to\\xa0use ice cream trucks to preserve the bodies.”\\n   \\nYasmine Mohammed, whose father was born and raised in Gaza, observed that “since Hamas’ attack on Israel, as I have read post after post on social media referring to Hamas as\\xa0freedom fighters\\xa0involved in anti-colonial resistance, I have been struck by the devastating weight of this lie. It is an insult to Palestinians to refer to these terrorists as our freedom fighters.”\\n   \\n      “At the hands of Hamas, the\\xa0Jewish people\\xa0have endured horrors\\xa0not seen since the Holocaust. And, like the Nazis, Hamas does not view Jewish people as human beings. According to\\xa0its 1988 covenant, every Jew must be eradicated from this earth.\\xa0Its goal is not the genocide of Jewish people in Israel; its goal is the genocide of all Jewish people on this planet, period…”\\n   \\n      “Hamas is not Gaza, and Gaza is not Hamas. Gaza is an area of land with people who are trying to do the best that they can to survive under abysmal circumstances. Gazans are just human beings, like their Israeli neighbors. They want to live in a peaceful environment where they do not have to be concerned about the safety of their children.”\\n   \\n      When comedian Pete Davidson was 7, his father, a New York City firefighter, died responding to the 9/11 terrorist attack on the World Trade Center. As Dean Obeidallah noted, that gave Davidson’s cold open on last week’s “Saturday Night Live” a haunting resonance.\\n   \\n“In a time when social media is filled with people saying they stand with one side or the other, Davidson instead made a plea to stand for humanity,” Obeidallah observed.\\n   \\n      Davidson said, “I saw so many terrible pictures this week of children suffering — Israeli children and Palestinian children — and it took me back to a really horrible, horrible place.” He added, “No one in this world deserves to suffer like that, especially not kids.”\\n   \\n      Wadea Al-Fayoume,\\xa0a 6-year-old Palestinian-American boy was stabbed to death last weekend outside Chicago by his family’s landlord, ”a 71-year-old man who’s been charged with murder and hate crimes, among other crimes,” wrote Khaled A. Beydoun. “The attacker also stabbed Wadea’s mother more than a dozen times. She\\xa0lived. But what does that word even mean anymore?… What does ‘living’ mean for\\xa0millions of Arabs and Muslims who call the United States home, burdened with the impossible task of proving their allegiance, over and over again, in response to bellowing demands that bury our humanity?”\\n   \\n      “It feels like we are living on borrowed time, like we were extended a contingent citizenship that can be stripped at any time, on account of events that unfold in America or on the other side of the world.”\\n   \\n      For more:\\n   \\nMukesh Kapila: War didn’t look like this when the Geneva Conventions were written\\n \\nFrida Ghitis: Zelensky’s inescapable new reality\\n \\nNicole Hemmer: Why student protests against Israel are so painful, polarizing and complicated\\n \\nKobi Michael, a longtime intelligence and security analyst for Israel, told Peter Bergen that Hamas used “more than 2,000 terrorists from the special unit of Hamas, the\\xa0Nukhba,” —or more than half the unit’s total manpower — to carry out its attack on southern Israel.\\n   \\n      “What was the strategic aim of such an operation, considering that they knew for sure that the price tag would be very high and they were endangering their very existence? I’m sure that Hamas was sure that the shock and horror of this operation and the casualties that they would cause would be interpreted by all the Palestinians, that this was a sign from God that this was the time to open all the battlefronts and to fight Israel and this will be the end of the state of Israel. They were sure about it.”\\n   \\n      Bergen wrote that “Khaled Hroub,\\xa0a\\xa0Palestinian academic and the author of ‘Hamas: A Beginner’s Guide,’\\xa0says he believes that Hamas did not expect that the October 7 attack on Israel would be the scale that it became, and the\\xa0group didn’t have a plan\\xa0for what came afterward.”\\n   \\n      Neither Israel nor Hamas have “a very clear plan for what happens down the road,” Hroub said. “Even if the Israeli military succeeded in destroying Hamas, the question facing everyone is, what’s next?”\\n   \\n      The election of Jim Jordan as House speaker seemed “to make perfect sense in the era of Trump,” wrote Julian Zelizer.\\n   \\n      “Jordan is as MAGA as they come. Indeed, he was doing MAGA along with the\\xa0Tea Party long before Trump\\xa0came to town. He has been a\\xa0staunch opponent of reproductive rights, a fervent\\xa0believer in radical deregulation, a\\xa0climate change denier, a culture wars soldier and anything-goes politician who believes government shutdowns are just part of the normal price of business.”\\n   \\n      Yet through three embarrassing ballots on the House floor, and after his allies in the party and the conservative media tried to squeeze the anti-Jordan members to flip in his favor, Jordan failed to gain the 217 Republican votes needed to win the post. On Friday afternoon, he lost another vote — a secret ballot among his GOP colleagues to remain the party’s nominee for speaker — and was essentially forced to drop out.\\n   \\n“The question is what has gone wrong? Intimidation, bullying and political pressure certainly can work,” Zelizer noted. “Just look at the Republican who is by far and away the\\xa0leading contender\\xa0in the race to become the nominee for his party in 2024, former President Donald Trump.”\\n   \\n      “It is not a mystery that Trump has built an entire career on the power of intimidation. If you are against him, he will put all his effort in destroying you. If you stand in his way, he rallies his supporters to make it clear that you will not survive being his opponent.”\\n   \\nJohn Avlon pointed to the intimidation tactics used against Republican legislators who refused to vote for Jordan, including an expletive-filled voicemail left for the wife of one congressman, which CNN’s Jake Tapper played on air. “This is the politics that Donald Trump’s rhetoric has wrought among his supporters in the Republican Party,” wrote Avlon. “It reflects the furious worldview that right wing media sells to keep its listeners addicted to the anger and anxiety, turning much of the GOP into what Utah Sen. Mitt Romney calls ‘a pro-authoritarian party.’”\\n   \\nSE Cupp said, “Republicans are squarely to blame for where they are today, more interested in punishing each other than they are in governing or solving problems. But, what if Democrats somewhere down the line are given an opportunity to step in and restore some functionality to the House?” They should take it, Cupp argued.\\n   \\n      “The American people aren’t stupid — they can see the mess Republicans have created for themselves. But at the end of the day, they’ll grow tired of intransigence and dysfunction in Congress. And eventually, Democrats will get the blame for that, too.”\\n   \\n      Sidney Powell drew fame in the closing days of the Trump administration for her bizarre election-denier claims and her threat to “release the Kraken.”\\n \\n      She never unveiled the promised evidence of fraud in the 2020 election and was instead criminally charged in Fulton County, Georgia, along with Trump and 17 other co-defendants for their alleged attempts to overturn the state’s 2020 election results. On Thursday, Powell “released\\xa0herself from the case by\\xa0pleading guilty\\xa0to six misdemeanor offenses and agreeing to testify truthfully against her codefendants as part of her plea deal,” wrote legal analyst Jennifer Rodgers.\\n   \\n      “Powell’s testimony is hugely important and her plea is a big breakthrough for prosecutors. She is the first cooperating witness who was part of the limited group that met with Trump to craft the plans to overthrow the election. She was also present at an\\xa0infamous meeting\\xa0at the White House on December 18, 2020 that devolved into a screaming match.”\\n   \\n      A day after Powell’s plea, attorney Kenneth Chesebro pleaded guilty to a felony charge of conspiracy, admitting that he took part in a scheme to create a slate of fake pro-Trump electors with Trump, Rudy Giuliani and John Eastman.\\n   \\n      On Monday, the former president had suffered another setback when the judge hearing the federal election interference case imposed a “gag order\\xa0on Trump, limiting his ability to publicly attack special counsel Jack Smith, Smith’s staff, court personnel and potential witnesses in the case related to Trump’s alleged attempts to overturn the 2020 election,” wrote Jill Filipovic. “It’s not a muzzle of Trump’s ability to speak in general, but it is a demand that he not smear those involved in the case against him…”\\n   \\n      “The decision to gag a defendant should not be taken lightly, nor infused with politics. It is crucial that Trump, as odious and dangerous as I personally find him, have the ability to fully campaign: to criticize his opponent, to criticize the system and to make the case for putting him back in the White House. Principles like the importance of free speech cannot bow to political preferences.”\\n   \\n      “But freedom has never existed without any limitation.”\\n   \\nDavid Goldblatt: The people Olympic host cities don’t want you to see\\n \\nAmy Bass: What Mary Lou Retton will always mean to us\\n \\nAmy Klein: Why ‘Old Dads’ made me so mad\\n \\nJudge Glock: The perfect storm hitting homebuyers\\n \\nHolly Thomas: Bearing the weight of all our hopes, the ‘Frasier’ revival never stood a chance\\n \\nRichie Hofmann: The poet who found truth in death, seasons, teaching and even ‘Schitt’s Creek’\\n \\nAND…\\n \\n      De Niro. DiCaprio. Scorsese.\\n   \\n      Could the Hollywood icons who collaborated on the new movie, “Killers of the Flower Moon” possibly match the high drama of David Grann’s 2017 book by that name?\\n   \\n      It chronicled the White settlers who murdered and stole from members of the oil-rich Osage tribe in Oklahoma in the 1920s and the excruciating effort to achieve a bit of justice. “To convey that gravitas,” wrote Noah Berlatsky, “Martin Scorsese has very self-consciously made an Important Movie. Leonardo\\xa0DiCaprio\\xa0and Robert De Niro give big, Oscar-eyeing performances. And the runtime is 3 hours and 26 minutes\\xa0—\\xa0a marathon apparently designed to bludgeon viewers into submission with meaning.”\\n   \\n“The heavy-handed approach, unfortunately, tends to squeeze a lot of the nuance and insight out of its source material…”\\n \\n      “DiCaprio’s performance is all sideways looks and shuffling evasion, with moments of dashing charm. It’s very well done, and, again, well-designed to wow the Oscar committee,” noted Berlatsky.\\n   \\n      “But should a movie about systemic racist violence really be focused on the Oscar-turn of the White villain? Scorsese has repeatedly, and with some justice, lambasted the sameness of blockbuster superhero films. But ‘Killers of the Flower Moon’ reveals that Scorsese’s narrative, genre-anchored, humanist approach to big, important filmmaking has serious limitations as well.”\\n  ',\n",

       "  'contents': ' \\n      Two stalwart allies of former President Donald Trump flipped against him this week, a staggering turn of events that could now pose a grave threat to his ability to fend off criminal charges related to his efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election. \\n   \\n      The rapid-fire developments are a massive boost for prosecutors in Fulton County, Georgia, and the separate but overlapping federal case against Trump that was filed by Justice Department special counsel Jack Smith.  \\n   \\n      The pleas are a stark display of the reality that the Georgia case against Trump and his co-defendants is getting stronger. While Trump has vowed to fight until the bitter end, these newly inked plea deals force his co-defendants to confront the same difficult choice: cut a deal or roll the dice at trial.\\n   \\n      For two prominent Trump co-defendants – Sidney Powell and Kenneth Chesebro – the looming five-month trial, potentially resulting in a yearslong prison sentence, appears to have spurred them into flipping. \\n   \\n      Their decisions to transform from Trump diehards to key witness against him have likely shattered any sense of invincibility that the former president or others charged may be feeling – perhaps for the first time.\\n   \\n      Chesebro pleaded guilty Friday to a felony conspiracy charge, admitting he worked with Trump and other members of the former president’s inner circle to overturn the 2020 election by putting forward slates of fake Republican electors in multiple states that Trump lost.  \\n   \\n      Chesebro directly implicated Trump in a criminal conspiracy, and his plea establishes for the first time that the fake electors plot was illegal. Notably, Chesebro has now admitted that “the purpose” of the fake electors conspiracy was to “disrupt and delay the joint session of Congress on January 6, 2021,” which is a key element of the federal charges Trump is facing.\\n   \\n      As part of the plea, Chesebro established that the fake electors plot was part of “an attempt… to violate” the US Constitution and federal law, by subverting the Electoral College proceedings. This dovetails with the allegations against Trump in Smith’s federal indictment.\\n   \\n      On Thursday, former Trump campaign lawyer Powell pleaded guilty to charges stemming from a separate, but complementary, effort to interfere with the 2020 election by breaching Georgia voting systems.\\n   \\n      While Powell’s guilty plea only covers charges related to the breach of election equipment in Coffee County, Georgia, her deal with prosecutors opens the door for testimony about first-hand interactions with Trump and other key co-defendants. \\n   \\n      For example, if called to the stand in a future trial, Powell could face questions about White House meetings she attended where Trump considered taking extreme steps to overturn the 2020 results, like ordering the Pentagon to seize voting machines.  \\n   \\n      Chesebro similarly agreed to cooperate fully with Fulton County investigators as part of his deal – which includes testifying against Trump and other defendants if called as a witness.  \\n   \\n      Trump is the only person charged thus far in the federal case, but both Chesebro and Powell are unindicted co-conspirators. Chesebro has now admitted conspiring with Trump in the same fake elector plot that is featured prominently in the federal case against Trump – which is set for trial in March.  \\n   \\n      Steve Sadow, Trump’s lead counsel in the Georgia election subversion case, responded Friday to Chesebro’s guilty plea by suggesting it was likely motivated by the “looming threat of prison time.”                                                                                                                                                                \\n   \\n      He speculated in a statement that Chesebro’s guilty plea “was the result of pressure by Fani Willis and her team, and the prosecution’s looming threat of prison time.”\\n   \\n      Trump’s attorney also pointed out that prosecutors dismissed Chesebro’s separate racketeering charge that underpins the indictment against all 19 co-defendants, including the former president. Prosecutors have now dropped that RICO charge against all three defendants who have already taken plea deals.\\n   \\n      But just because a onetime Trump loyalist has decided to help prosecutors go after him, that doesn’t mean the former president is doomed.\\n   \\n      Back in 2018, Trump’s ex-lawyer Michael Cohen struck a plea deal with federal prosecutors and implicated Trump in an illegal campaign finance conspiracy – but the Justice Department never charged Trump with that alleged crime. But Cohen has cooperated with New York state investigators and is set to testify against Trump next week at Trump’s civil business fraud trial there. \\n   \\n      Sadow brushed off the threat of possible testimony from Chesebro and Powell at Trump’s eventual trial on the Georgia election subversion charges.\\n   \\n      “Once again, I fully expect that truthful testimony would be favorable to my defense strategy,” Sadow said.  \\n   \\nThis story has been updated with additional information.\\n',\n",

       " {'headline': '\\n      Redistricting fights in these 10 states could determine which party controls the US House\\n    ',\n",
       "  'contents': ' \\n      Around the country, politicians are waging high-stakes battles over new congressional lines that could influence which party controls the US House of Representatives after the 2024 election.\\n   \\n      In North Carolina, the Republicans who control the state legislature have crafted a map that could help them flip at least three seats. Democrats, meanwhile, could pick up seats in legal skirmishes now playing out in New York, Louisiana, Georgia and other states.\\n   \\n      In all, the fate of anywhere from 14 to 18 House seats across nearly a dozen states could turn on the results of these fights. Republicans currently hold just a five-seat edge in the US House. That razor-edge majority has been underscored in recent weeks by the GOP’s chaotic struggle to elect a new speaker. \\n   \\n      “Given that the majority is so narrow, every outcome matters to the fight for House control in 2024,” said David Wasserman, who follows redistricting closely as senior editor and elections analyst for The Cook Political Report with Amy Walter.\\n   \\n      And with fewer competitive districts that swing between the political parties, Wasserman added, “every line change is almost existential.”\\n   \\n      Experts say several other factors have helped lead to the slew of consequential – and unresolved – redistricting disputes, just months before the first primaries of the 2024 cycle.\\n   \\n      They include pandemic-related delays in completing the 2020 census – the once-a-decade population count that kicks off congressional and state legislative redistricting – as well as a 2019 Supreme Court ruling that threw decisions about partisan gerrymandering back to state courts.\\n   \\n      In addition, some litigation had been frozen in place until the US Supreme Court’s surprise ruling in June, which found that a Republican-crafted redistricting plan in Alabama disadvantaged Black voters in the state and was in violation of the landmark 1965 Voting Rights Act.\\n   \\n      That decision “is functionally reanimating all of these dormant cases,” said Adam Kincaid, the president and executive director of the National Republican Redistricting Trust, which supports the GOP’s redistricting efforts.\\n   \\n      Kincaid said it’s too soon to tell whether Republicans or Democrats will emerge with the advantage by Election Day 2024. In his view, either party could gain or lose only about two seats over redistricting.\\n   \\n      In many of the closely watched states where action is pending, just a single seat hangs in the balance, with two notable exceptions: North Carolina and New York, where multiple seats are at stake. Republicans control the map-drawing in the Tar Heel State, while the job could fall to Democrats in New York, potentially canceling out each party’s gains.\\n   \\n      “Democrats kind of need to run the table in the rest of these states” to gain any edge, said Nick Seabrook, a political scientist at the University of North Florida and the author of the 2022 book “One Person, One Vote: A Surprising History of Gerrymandering in America.”\\n   \\n      Here’s a state-by-state look at recent and upcoming redistricting disputes that could shape the 2024 race for control of the US House:\\n   \\n      In one of the cycle’s highest-profile redistricting cases, a three-judge panel in Alabama approved a map that creates a second congressional district with a substantial Black population. Before the court action, Alabama – which is 27% Black – had only one Black-majority congressional district out of seven seats.\\n   \\n      The fight over the map went all the way to the Supreme Court – which issued a surprise ruling, affirming a lower-court opinion that ordered Alabama to include a second Black-majority district or “something quite close to it.” Under the map that will be in place for the 2024 election, the state’s 2nd District now loops into Mobile to create a seat where nearly half the population is Black.\\n   \\n      The high court’s 5-4 decision in June saw two conservatives, Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Brett Kavanaugh, side with the three liberals to uphold the lower-court ruling. Their action kept intact a key pillar of the Voting Rights Act: that it’s illegal to draw maps that effectively keep Black voters from electing a candidate of their choice.\\n   \\n      The ruling has reverberated around the country and could affect the outcome of similar court cases underway in Louisiana and Georgia that center on whether Republican-drawn maps improperly diluted Black political power in those states.\\n   \\n      Given that Black voters in Alabama have traditionally backed Democrats, the party now stands a better chance of winning the newly reconfigured district and sending to of its members to Congress after next year’s elections. \\n   \\n      The new map – approved in recent days by the lower-court judges – also could result in two Black US House members from Alabama serving together for the first time in state history. \\n   \\n      A state judge in September struck down congressional lines for northern Florida that had been championed by Gov. Ron DeSantis, ruling that the Republican governor’s map had improperly diluted Black voting power. \\n   \\n      This case, unlike the Alabama fight decided by the US Supreme Court, centers on provisions in the state constitution.\\n   \\n      The judge concluded that the congressional boundaries – which essentially dismantled a seat once held by Al Lawson, a Black Democrat, that connected Black communities across a northern reach of the Florida – violated the state’s Fair Districts amendments, enacted by voters. One amendment specifically bars the state from drawing a district that diminishes the ability of racial minorities “to elect representatives of their choice.” \\n   \\n      Arguments before an appeals court are slated for later this month, with litigants seeking a decision by late November. The case is expected to land before the all-Republican state Supreme Court, where DeSantis appointees hold most seats.\\n   \\n      A separate federal case – which argues that the map violates the US Constitution – is pending.\\n   \\n      But observers say the outcome of the state litigation is more likely than the federal case to determine whether Florida lawmakers must restore the North Florida district, given the state constitution’s especially strong protections for the voting rights of racial minorities and the lower burden of proof required to establish that those rights were abridged.\\n   \\n      A redistricting case in the Peach State recently decided by a federal judge could result in an additional seat for Democrats. \\n   \\n      US District Judge Steve Jones has ordered state lawmakers to draw a new congressional map by December 8, arguing that the Republican-controlled legislature improperly diluted the political power of Black voters in their establishment of district boundaries following the 2020 census.\\n   \\n      In his ruling, Jones said state lawmakers had violated the Voting Rights Act\\n   \\n      “The Court commends Georgia for the great strides that it has made to increase the political opportunities of Black voters in the 58 years since the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965,” Jones wrote. “Despite these great gains, the Court determines that in certain areas of the State, the political process is not equally open to Black voters.”\\n   \\n      Jones wrote that minorities accounted for “all” of the state’s population growth over the past decade but that “the number of majority-Black congressional and legislative districts remained the same.” \\n   \\n      Currently, Republicans hold nine of the 14 seats in Georgia’s congressional delegation. Black people make up a majority, or close to it, in four districts, including three in the Atlanta area. \\n   \\n      In 2022, Jones preliminarily ruled that some parts of the Republicans’ redistricting plan likely violated federal law but allowed the map to be used in that year’s midterm elections.\\n   \\n      A separate federal case in Georgia challenges the congressional map on constitutional grounds and is slated to go to trial in November.\\n   \\n      The Kentucky Supreme Court could soon decide whether a map drawn by the state’s Republican-controlled legislature amounts to what Democrats assert is an “extreme partisan” gerrymander in violation of the state’s constitution.\\n   \\n      Much of the case focuses on disputes over state legislative maps, but the congressional lines also are at stake, with critics saying lawmakers moved Kentucky’s capital city – Democratic-leaning Frankfort – out of the 6th Congressional District and into an oddly shaped – and solidly Republican – 1st District to help shore up Republican odds of holding the 6th District.\\n   \\n      The 6th District, represented by GOP Rep. Andy Barr, was one of the more competitive seats in Kentucky under its previous lines. (Democrat Amy McGrath came within 3 points of beating Barr in 2018; last year, Barr won a sixth term under the new lines by 29 points.)\\n   \\n      A lower-court judge already has ruled that the Republican-drawn map does not violate the state’s constitution. \\n   \\n      The Supreme Court’s decision in Alabama could pave the way for a new congressional map in Louisiana ahead of the 2024 election, but the case has quickly become mired in appeals.\\n   \\n      Although Black people make up roughly a third of the state’s population, Louisiana has just one Black lawmaker in its six-member congressional delegation. \\n   \\n      A federal judge threw out the state’s Republican-drawn map in 2022, saying it likely violated the Voting Rights Act. Republican officials in the state appealed to the US Supreme Court, which put the lower-court ruling on hold until it decided the Alabama case, which it did in June this year. \\n   \\n      Once the high court weighed in on the Alabama case, the legal skirmishes again lurched to life in Louisiana.\\n   \\n      Louisiana Republicans have filed an appeal with the 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals and successfully halted a district court hearing to discuss imposing a new, court-ordered map. \\n   \\n      On Thursday, the US Supreme Court declined to allow the federal district judge to move forward with discussions about drawing a new map while the appeal advances through the courts.\\n   \\n      GOP state officials say, among other things, that they are seeking time to redraw the map themselves. Critics of the state’s original map argue that Republicans are using legal maneuvers to delay a new redistricting plan, which could result in a second Democratic-leaning seat.\\n   \\n      Legal battles that drag on risk judges invoking the so-called Purcell Principle, a doctrine that limits changing voting procedures and boundaries too close to Election Day to guard against voter confusion.\\n   \\n      “Some of the reason it becomes too late is because, in many of these cases, the state is prolonging the litigation … and buying more time with an illegal map,” said Kareem Crayton, senior director for voting and representation at the liberal-leaning Brennan Center for Justice.\\n   \\n      Republicans in New Mexico say the congressional lines drawn by the Democrats who control state government amount to an illegal gerrymander under the state’s constitution.\\n   \\n      At stake: a swing district along the US border with Mexico. If Republicans prevail, the seat – now held by a Democratic Rep. Gabe Vasquez – could become more favorable to Republicans.\\n   \\n      A state judge recently upheld the map drawn by Democrats, but the New Mexico Supreme Court is expected to review that order on appeal.\\n   \\n      Republicans flipped four US House seats in New York in the 2022 midterm elections, victories that helped secure their party’s majority in the chamber.\\n   \\n      Current legal fights in the Empire State over redistricting, however, could erase those gains.\\n   \\n      A state court judge oversaw last year’s process of drawing the current map following a long legal battle and the inability of New York’s bipartisan redistricting commission to agree on new lines. But Democrats scored a court victory earlier this year when a state appellate court ruled that the redistricting commission should draw new lines. \\n   \\n      Republicans have appealed that decision, and oral arguments are set for mid-November before New York’s Court of Appeals, the state’s highest court. The commission’s map-making also is on hold.\\n   \\n      If Democrats prevail, it could make it easier for their party to pick up as many as six seats now held by Republicans.\\n   \\n      North Carolina’s legislature, where Republicans hold a supermajority, has drawn new congressional lines that observers say could prove a windfall for the GOP and boost the party’s chances of retaining its House majority next year.\\n   \\n      The state’s current House delegation is split 7-7 between Democrats and Republicans.\\n   \\n      A map that state lawmakers recently approved puts three House Democrats in what one expert called “almost impossible to win” districts.\\n   \\n      The affected Democrats are Reps. Jeff Jackson, who currently represents a Charlotte-area district; Wiley Nickel, who holds a Raleigh-area seat; and Kathy Manning, who represents Greensboro and other parts of north-central North Carolina.\\n   \\n      A fourth Democrat, Rep. Don Davis, saw his district retooled to become more friendly toward Republicans while remaining competitive for both parties.\\n   \\n      State-level gains in the 2022 midterm elections have given the GOP new sway over redistricting in this swing state. Last year, Republicans flipped North Carolina’s Supreme Court, whose members are chosen in partisan elections. The new GOP majority on the court this year tossed out a 2022 ruling by the then-Democratic leaning court against partisan gerrymandering.\\n   \\n      A map that had been created after the Democratic-led high court’s ruling resulted in the current even split in the state’s House delegation.\\n   \\n      Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper does not have veto power over redistricting legislation.\\n   \\n      A redistricting case pending before the US Supreme Court centers on the future of a Charleston-area seat held by Republican Rep. Nancy Mace, who made headlines recently for joining House GOP hard-liners in voting to remove Kevin McCarthy as speaker.\\n   \\n      Earlier this year, a three-judge panel concluded that lines for the coastal 1st Congressional District, as drawn by state GOP lawmakers, amounted to an unconstitutional racial gerrymander.\\n   \\n      The Republican lawmakers appealed to the US Supreme Court. And, during oral arguments earlier this month, several justices in the court’s conservative majority expressed skepticism that South Carolina officials had engaged in an improper racial gerrymander and seemed inclined to reinstate the lawmakers’ map.\\n   \\n      The state Supreme Court, in a case it heard in July, is considering whether it even has the authority to weigh in on map-drawing decisions by the GOP-controlled state legislature.\\n   \\n      Republican state officials argue that the court’s power over redistricting decisions is limited.\\n   \\n      Advocacy groups and a handful of voters are challenging a congressional map that further carved up Democratic-leaning Salt Lake County between four decidedly Republican districts.\\n   \\n      Doing so, the plaintiffs argued in their lawsuit, “takes a slice of Salt Lake County and grafts it onto large swaths of the rest of Utah,” allowing Republican voters in rural areas and smaller cities far away from Salt Lake to “dictate the outcome of elections.”\\n   \\n      Redistricting fights over congressional maps are ongoing in several other states – ranging from Texas to Tennessee – but those cases might not be resolved in time to affect next year’s elections.\\n   \\nThis story has been updated with additional information. \\n',\n",

       "  'contents': ' \\n      Kenneth Chesebro, an attorney who helped orchestrate the Trump campaign’s 2020 fake electors plot, pleaded guilty Friday in the Georgia election subversion case to being part of a conspiracy alongside former President Donald Trump and others.\\n   \\n      The plea deal is another blow to Trump and a major victory for Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis, who charged Trump and 18 others in the effort to overturn the 2020 presidential election. It comes one day after former Trump campaign lawyer Sidney Powell also pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors. \\n   \\n      Chesebro pleaded guilty to one felony – conspiracy to commit filing false documents. Fulton County prosecutors recommended that he serve 5 years of probation and pay $5,000 in restitution, and Fulton County Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee imposed that sentence at Friday’s hearing. \\n   \\n      Chesebro has also agreed to testify in future court proceedings.\\n   \\n      As part of his plea deal, Chesebro admitted that he conspired to put forward fake GOP electors in Georgia with Trump and former Trump lawyers Rudy Giuliani and John Eastman. Giuliani and Eastman have both pleaded not guilty in the Georgia case, and now face the prospect of Chesebro taking the witness stand against them. \\n   \\n      The plea came shortly after jury selection in the trial began Friday morning as planned, but was short-lived. A source familiar with the discussions said the likelihood of Chesebro taking a deal increased after Powell made a surprise turn and pleaded guilty on Thursday. \\n   \\n      An attorney who worked to undermine the results of the 2020 election, Chesebro helped develop the Trump’s campaign’s plot to put forward unauthorized slates of GOP electors in Georgia and six other states. (In previous court filings, Chesebro’s lawyers have denied that he devised the plan.)\\n   \\n      He wrote a series of memos in 2020 spelling out what the pro-Trump electors should do in their respective states. In one memo Chesebro acknowledged that he was promoting a “controversial strategy” that even the Supreme Court with its conservative supermajority would “likely” reject. \\n   \\n      Chesebro and other Trump allies hoped then-Vice President Mike Pence would use the GOP electors to justify delaying Congress from certifying Joe Biden’s victory – or even throw out Biden’s lawful electors and recognize the fake GOP slates instead on January 6, 2021.\\n   \\n      Prosecutors said in court that Chesebro acknowledged in the plea that he “created and distributed false Electoral College documents” to Trump operatives in Georgia and other states, and that he worked “in coordination with” the Trump campaign. \\n   \\n      “The defendant provided detailed instructions to co-conspirators in Georgia and other states for creating and distributing these false documents,” prosecutor Daysha Young said at the plea hearing Friday. \\n   \\n      Chesebro was originally charged with seven crimes, including a violation of Georgia’s RICO act, conspiracy to commit forgery and conspiracy to commit impersonating a public officer. Six of the seven felony charges were dropped as part of the deal. \\n   \\n      In addition to testifying at future trials, Chesebro agreed to write an apology letter to the citizens of Georgia. \\n   \\n      Three defendants have now pleaded guilty in the sprawling racketeering case: Chesebro, Powell and Georgia-based bail bondsman Scott Hall.\\n   \\n      Powell and Hall both admitted their roles in the January 2021 breach of election systems in rural Coffee County, Georgia. As part of her plea deal, Powell agreed to testify at future trials, which could hurt Trump’s defense. Both Powell and Hall were sentenced to probation. \\n   \\n      Ahead of their scheduled trial, Chesebro and Powell lost several bids to get the case thrown out, including earlier this week. In a spate of pretrial rulings, McAfee rejected their arguments that Fulton County prosecutors misapplied Georgia’s RICO law and that the indictment failed to establish key elements of the crimes that have been charged.\\n   \\n      Both Powell and Chesebro are unindicted co-conspirators in Trump’s federal election subversion case, which was brought by Justice Department special counsel Jack Smith. Trump’s federal trial is set for March 2024 in Washington, DC.  \\n   \\n      Steve Sadow, lead counsel for Trump in the Georgia case, said he believes Friday’s developments will help the former president.\\n   \\n      “It appears to me that the guilty plea to count 15 of the Fulton County indictment was the result of pressure by Fani Willis and her team and the prosecution’s looming threat of prison time,” Sadow said. “However, it is very important for everyone to note that the RICO charge and every other count was dismissed. Once again, I fully expect that truthful testimony would be favorable to my defense strategy.”\\n   \\n      Hundreds of potential jurors for the Chesebro trial were summoned to the Fulton County courthouse on Friday, where they filled out questionnaires that were designed to weed out people with conflicts-of-interest or anyone who couldn’t act impartially.\\n   \\n      CNN overheard a court official reading aloud from portions the jury questionnaire in a public area of the courthouse where the jury selection process was taking place. The questionnaire itself has not been made public.  \\n   \\n      The potential jurors were asked if they “express divisive political opinions,” if they ever attended a Trump rally or any “MAGA events,” or posted anything online about “Donald Trump’s charges.”\\n   \\n      They were also asked specifically if they watched the highly publicized January 6 committee hearings last year, which presented in dramatic fashion how Trump tried to overturn the election.  \\n   \\n      The potential jurors were also asked if they voted in any federal elections over the past 15 years. There is no indication that they were asked who they voted for, and that is never typically part of a jury questionnaire. \\n   \\n      At a hearing earlier this week, Fulton County prosecutors and attorneys for Chesebro haggled over how many politically charged questions should be included. Specifically, Chesebro’s attorneys wanted to include questions that could tease out how jurors feel about “MAGA Republicans” and Trump’s attempt to “steal the election.” It’s unclear if those questions made it into the questionnaire. \\n   \\n      After Chesebro’s plea, McAfee returned to the jury room to dismiss the jury pool, which responded with applause and cheers.\\n \\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.\\n',\n",

       "  'contents': ' \\nSign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter.\\xa0Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\\n \\n      The James Webb Space Telescope and other observatories witnessed a massive explosion in space that created rare chemical elements, some of which are necessary for life.\\n   \\n      The explosion, which occurred on March 7, was the second brightest gamma-ray burst ever witnessed by telescopes in more than 50 years of observations, over one million times brighter than the entire Milky Way Galaxy combined. Gamma-ray bursts are short emissions of the most energetic form of light.\\n   \\n      This particular burst, called GRB 230307A, was likely created when two neutron stars — the incredibly dense remnants of stars after a supernova — merged in a galaxy about one billion light-years away. In addition to releasing the gamma-ray burst, the merger created a kilonova, a rare explosion that occurs when a neutron star merges with another neutron star or a black hole, according to a study published Wednesday in the journal Nature.\\n   \\n      “There are only a mere handful of known kilonovas, and this is the first time we have been able to look at the aftermath of a kilonova with the James Webb Space Telescope,” said lead study author Andrew Levan, astrophysics professor at Radboud University in the Netherlands. Levan was also part of the team that made the first detection of a kilonova in 2013.\\n   \\n      In addition to Webb, NASA’s Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory, and the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite observed the burst and traced it back to the neutron star merger. Webb was also used to detect the chemical signature of tellurium within the aftermath of the explosion.\\n   \\n      Tellurium, a rare metalloid, is used to tint glass and ceramics and has a role in the manufacturing process of rewritable CDs and DVDs, according to the Royal Society of Chemistry.

Gamma-ray bursts are short emissions of the most energetic form of light.\\n   \\n      This particular burst, called GRB 230307A, was likely created when two neutron stars — the incredibly dense remnants of stars after a supernova — merged in a galaxy about one billion light-years away. In addition to releasing the gamma-ray burst, the merger created a kilonova, a rare explosion that occurs when a neutron star merges with another neutron star or a black hole, according to a study published Wednesday in the journal Nature.\\n   \\n      “There are only a mere handful of known kilonovas, and this is the first time we have been able to look at the aftermath of a kilonova with the James Webb Space Telescope,” said lead study author Andrew Levan, astrophysics professor at Radboud University in the Netherlands.

Webb was also used to detect the chemical signature of tellurium within the aftermath of the explosion.\\n   \\n      Tellurium, a rare metalloid, is used to tint glass and ceramics and has a role in the manufacturing process of rewritable CDs and DVDs, according to the Royal Society of Chemistry.

Cluster headache attacks can occur every day for six to eight weeks and then go away in a cluster cycle. The theory is that you can actually trigger a cycle by switching the time with Daylight Saving Time.\\n   \\n      The connection between the time change and cluster headaches is that the portion of the brain that is also the generator for cluster headaches is also the portion of the brain that manages our circadian rhythms, which is located in the hypothalamus.\\n   \\n      Also, a lot of migraine sufferers usually will have a little bit of sleep deprivation, or their sleep is affected by this change, so they’ll see an increase in headache frequency during that period.\\n   \\nCNN: Why does Daylight Saving Time have such an impact?\\n \\nDasgupta: Despite being a seemingly small shift, DST can significantly impact our circadian rhythm, which regulates our sleep-wake cycle.\\n   \\n      Sleep is very individualized. Not everyone’s going to be equally affected by the change in our circadian rhythm. It’s important to realize that it’s not just Daylight Saving (Time) changes that can trigger these attacks, even changing time zones can trigger cluster headaches.\\n   \\nCNN: Should we worry about getting depressed as it gets darker out?\\n \\nDasgupta: The end of Daylight Saving Time brings about reduced light and shorter fall and winter days – and this change may increase\\xa0Seasonal Affective Disorder, a type of depression triggered by the changing of the seasons and waning daylight.\\n   \\n      It’s well documented that (the time change) does not directly cause mental health conditions, but it definitely can really do a number on people with preexisting conditions.\\n   \\n      I don’t want anyone to feel that they need to suffer or they need to actually live with their mood not going in the right direction. If you notice a shift in your mental health, particularly if it affects your quality of life, always contact a healthcare provider.\\n   \\nCNN: Are there any populations who should be more mindful of the time change?\\n \\nDasgupta: Individuals with Alzheimer’s and dementia are particularly vulnerable to sleep disturbances, and the disruption caused by DST can exacerbate their symptoms.\\n   \\n      These individuals often experience disrupted sleep-wake cycles due to cognitive impairments, leading to irregular sleep patterns and daytime drowsiness.\\n   \\n      The connection between\\xa0Daylight Saving Time\\xa0and sleep disturbances in people with Alzheimer’s and dementia is particularly concerning, as sleep plays a vital role in cognitive function and memory consolidation. Sleep disturbances can exacerbate the cognitive decline associated with Alzheimer’s and dementia, making it even more difficult for individuals to perform daily activities and maintain independence.\\n   \\nCNN: What can we do for people who are more vulnerable?\\n \\nDasgupta: I would say just being aware of these things. Of course, when you have poor quality and quantity sleep, it can predispose you to things like falls — and we never want anyone to fall.\\n   \\n      Be more cognizant around that time. If you are a primary caregiver or just someone who’s visiting a loved one who has Alzheimer’s, be aware of these things.\\n   \\nCNN: How can we protect ourselves from the impact of the time change?\\n \\nDasgupta: That’s going to be slowly adjusting your schedule, doing things that will maybe help out that transition. Getting exercise, spending time outside in the morning, and light therapy can be helpful strategies during the fall and winter.\\n   \\n      I think it’s also very important that people – specifically talking about migraines, it’s just unfortunate that this is one of the triggers – twice a year have your medications ready.\\n   \\n      No matter what we’re talking about, whether it’s your mood or your headache, if you notice that you’re getting a worsening headache, it’s not stopping, the usual medications are not working, go to your healthcare provider right away.\\n  ',\n",

       "  'contents': ' \\nSign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter.\\xa0Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\\n \\n      Declassified photos captured by United States spy satellites launched during the Cold War have revealed an archaeological treasure trove: hundreds of previously unknown Roman-era forts, in what is now Iraq and Syria.\\n   \\n      Many of those long-lost structures may be gone forever at this point, destroyed or damaged over recent decades due to agricultural expansion, urban development and war. Nevertheless, the discovery of the forts’ existence challenges a popular hypothesis established in the 1930s about the role of such fortifications along the ancient Roman Empire’s eastern border, researchers reported Wednesday in the journal Antiquity.\\n   \\n      Based on the satellite views, the high number of forts and their widespread distribution hints that the forts may not have been erected to keep enemies out, as the decades-old theory suggested. Rather, the structures were likely built to ensure safe passage for caravans and travelers along routes that saw plenty of nonmilitary traffic. These forts, according to the study authors, were outposts and havens, not hostile barriers.\\n   \\n      High-resolution images analyzed in the new study were taken during flyovers by multiple satellites belonging to two US military programs: the Corona Project (1960 to 1972) and Hexagon (1971 to 1986). Corona’s images were declassified in 1995, and Hexagon’s photos were released to the public in 2011.\\n   \\n      Images from Hexagon and Corona are invaluable for archaeologists because they preserve snapshots of landscapes that have since undergone significant disruption, said lead study author Jesse Casana, an archaeologist and professor in the department of anthropology at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire.\\n   \\n      “Agriculture and urbanization have destroyed a lot of archaeological sites and features to a shocking degree,” Casana told CNN. “This old imagery allows us to see things that are often either obscured or no longer extant today.”\\n   \\n      Satellite images are especially helpful for searches across the northern part of the Fertile Crescent in the Middle East — from the eastern coast of the Mediterranean to western Iran\\xa0— because of the area’s archaeological importance and high visibility of the ground in photos, Casana added.\\n   \\n      The research team pored over the images for signs of Roman forts, which have a distinctive square shape and walls that usually measure about 164 to 262 feet (50 to 80 meters) long. The scientists began their search using reference maps from an aerial survey of the region conducted in the 1920s and 1930s by French archaeologist and Jesuit missionary Father Antoine Poidebard. That survey was among the first to photograph archaeological sites from the air, and in 1934 Poidebard reported finding 116 Roman forts.\\n   \\n      It was an unprecedented achievement. But nearly a century later, mapping Poidebard’s forts to satellite photos was challenging. Because his map wasn’t large-scale, it contained numerous spatial errors, Casana said. Poidebard also did not provide names or numbers for most of the forts he found, identifying them instead by their proximity to geologic features.\\n   \\n      Those forts were aligned north to south along what was once the easternmost boundary of the Roman Empire, according to Poidebard. This arrangement, he claimed, was surely intended to guard against invaders from the east.\\n   \\n      But Poidebard’s survey provided only a partial view of Rome’s ancient infrastructure, the researchers found. What he overlooked — and what the satellite photos revealed — was that the north-to-south line of 116 forts was actually only a narrow sliver of a cluster spreading from east to west and containing 396 fortified structures.\\n   \\n      The forts spanned approximately 116,000 square miles (300,000 square kilometers), “extending from Mosul, on the Tigris River in Iraq, through Ninawa province, across the Khabur and the Balikh valleys, continuing to the semi-arid plains west of the Euphrates River, leading to western Syria and the Mediterranean,” according to the study.\\n   \\n      When the archaeologists performed a second survey of an image subset, they found 106 more fortlike structures, hinting that further investigations will yield many more Roman forts. Based on excavations of other Roman sites in the region, the scientists estimated that the forts were built between the second and sixth centuries.\\n   \\n      While Poidebard’s row of forts along the Roman Empire’s eastern front looked like a military fortification, this new evidence suggested that the forts collectively served a different purpose. Rather than presenting an impassable wall on a violent frontier, they provided oases of safety and order along well-traveled Roman roads.\\n   \\n      Borders in this world “were places of dynamic cultural exchange and movement of goods and ideas,” not barriers, Casana said. And perhaps that perspective holds a lesson for the modern era, he added.\\n   \\n      “Historically, as an archaeologist, I can say that there have been many attempts by ancient states to build walls across borders and it has been a universal failure,” Casana said. “If there’s any way that archaeology contributes to modern discourse, I would hope it is that building giant walls to keep people out is a bad plan.”\\n   \\nMindy Weisberger is a science writer and media producer whose work has appeared in Live Science, Scientific American and How It Works magazine.\\n',\n",

More than a decade later, it remains one of her most popular tunes. Her artistry, as well as that of many others who have mastered the art of tugging at our heartstrings with slow and emotional beats, has a way of managing the emotional pain of heartbreak and loss.\\n   \\n      There is no doubt that music can soothe the soul for some, and it turns out that it could also be a temporary soother for physical pain.\\n   \\n      Listening to favorite songs could reduce people’s perception of pain, according to a new study published Wednesday in the journal Frontiers in Pain Research. And the most effective pain relievers were found to be sad songs detailing bittersweet and emotional experiences.\\n   \\n      “It doesn’t take the place of Tylenol when you have a headache, but music can help take the edge off,” said Patrick Stroman, a professor of biomedical and molecular sciences at Queen’s University in Kingston, Ontario. He was not involved in the latest study but has conducted his own research on the relationship between pain and music. Unlike other medications, he noted, there is no side effect or risk to listening to music (just keep the volume at a reasonable level).\\n   \\n      The small study invited 63 young adults to bring two of their favorite songs, and the only requirement was that they needed to be at least 3 minutes and 20 seconds long. One selection represented their favorite music of all time, and the other was the song they would bring with them on a desert island. The researchers also had the young adults pick one of seven songs that the team considered relaxing and were unfamiliar to the study participants. (The seven they could choose from were “Cotton Blues,” “Jamaicare,” “Légende Celtique,” “Musique de Film,” “Nuit Cubaine,” “Reggae Calédonien” and “Sega Mizik Kèr.”)\\n   \\n      Each person underwent 7-minute blocks where they were instructed to stare at a monitor screen while listening to their favorite music, one of the seven relaxing instrumental songs (each of which lasted for 6 minutes and 40 seconds), or a scrambled version of both songs and the relaxing song chosen. The scrambled music was a noisy jumble of all three songs, cut into fragments and randomly shuffled so that they lacked their original structure. One 7-minute block had people sitting in silence. All the while, the researchers stuck a hot object — similar to the pain of a boiling hot teacup on your skin — to the participants’ left inner forearms.\\n   \\n      When rating their experiences, people were more likely to report feeling less pain when listening to their favorite songs compared with hearing the unfamiliar relaxing song or silence. The scrambled songs did not reduce pain either, which the authors suggested was evidence of music being more than a distraction from an unpleasant experience.\\n   \\n      With millions of songs available, one person’s favorite song is likely not the same as another. After interviewing the participants about the song they brought and their rating of pain, the researchers found people who listened to bittersweet and moving songs felt less pain than when they listened to songs with calming or cheerful themes.\\n   \\n      “It’s a very cool result,” said lead study author Darius Valevicius, a doctoral student of neurosciences at the University of Montreal. “I think it’s something that myself and probably many people intuitively pick up on why we listen to bittersweet, melancholic or even spiritual music.”\\n   \\n      People who listened to bittersweet songs also reported more chills — the thrill and shivers you get on your skin from listening to pleasurable music. This sensation was associated with lower ratings of unpleasantness elicited by the burning pain they felt in the experiment. While not thoroughly studied here, Valevicius said he thought those musical chills could be causing these pain-blocking effects.\\n   \\n      While he didn’t research chills in this study, Valevicius hypothesized that these sensations might be signs of sensory gating. To prevent overloading the brain with every stimulus around a person, the brain filters out any it considers redundant or irrelevant. In this case, the brain might be tuning into the music and filtering out some messages of incoming pain. While our bodies still feel the pain, the messages to make our conscious mind perceive the pain may not be relayed.\\n   \\nWATCH: Scientists turned spiderwebs into music and it sounds like a nightmare\\n \\n      Your brain on music is likely tapping into the body’s built-in system for regulating pain, Stroman said. The body’s ability to engage emotions and feelings helps to gauge how important the pain is at that moment. Stroman and his research team recently used brain imaging to capture what goes on in the central nervous system when people are exposed to pain while listening to music. The researchers observed music-altering brain connectivity across multiple brain regions involved in pain, memory and processing subjective emotional states.\\n   \\n      “When people are listening to music they enjoy, by our measurements it can reduce the pain that we’re feeling by 10%,” he said. Stroman cautioned, however, that this behavior is not enough of an analgesic to avoid medication or medical services.\\n   \\n      Still, there is nothing wrong with picking a more upbeat song if that is your preference. Music provides many other health benefits, including stress reduction and a good night’s sleep. Valevicius said he has embraced this balm, stating “I definitely have let myself indulge a little more in listening to music.”\\n   \\nJocelyn Solis-Moreira is a New York-based freelance health and science journalist.\\n',\n",

       "  'contents': ' \\nEditor’s note: Shift Your Mindset is a new series from CNN’s Mindfulness, But Better team. We talk to experts about how to do things differently to live a better life.\\n \\n      Ever lost your cool with your kid? Really, who hasn’t? Fortunately, there are steps we can take to mend ties with our children — or anyone, for that matter — and heal relationship disruptions after tempers flare.\\n   \\n      “Parenting whisperer,” clinical psychologist and author of the bestseller “Good Inside: A Guide to Becoming the Parent You Want To Be,” Dr. Becky Kennedy says it’s never too late to heal rifts with our kids. In her powerful new TED Talk, Kennedy walks listeners through what she calls the single most important parenting strategy: repair.\\n   \\n      By “prioritizing connection over consequences,” Kennedy encourages parents to rewrite the ending of a not-so-great parenting moment, rewiring our children’s brains in the process. Making steps toward repair with our kids is important because it models taking responsibility for our actions and reactions while promoting resilience and a clear sense of self.\\n   \\nThis conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.\\n \\nCNN: What does it mean for a parent or guardian to repair after yelling at their child?\\n \\nDr. Becky Kennedy: At its core, repair is about reconnecting with a kid after disconnection. By bringing our safe, compassionate self to our children following a moment when we lost our temper, we change how that memory gets stored in their bodies. Layering on support after criticism, softness after yelling and understanding after misunderstanding helps transform any messages our kids have internalized that they’re alone or bad inside.\\n   \\n      Start by saying you’re sorry. Next, reflect back what happened so they know it wasn’t all in their heads. Then say what you wish you’d done instead and how you plan to handle things differently in the future.\\n   \\nCNN: You explain that repair changes the wiring in a child’s brain. How can a conversation we have with our child after the fact alter an existing memory?\\n \\nKennedy: Memory isn’t simply a system of recalling events; it’s more like a game of telephone. Every time you remember an event from your past, your brain networks change in ways that modify the recollection of that event. This is why therapy is helpful. Recalling distressing experiences when we felt overwhelmed and alone within the context of a safer, more connected relationship helps us put meaning to it and start to connect the dots. The therapeutic relationship changes the memory so it’s no longer so overwhelming. The event doesn’t change but the way it lives in your body does.\\n   \\n      This phenomenon sits at the core of repair. When I yell at my kid, or say words I wish I hadn’t, they likely feel scared, overwhelmed and alone. If I’m able to explain afterward why this thing happened and how it wasn’t really my kid’s fault, the connection, love, safety and compassion they feel from me will get stored in my child’s body next to the distressing event. Because of my repair, their memory of the event won’t be as overstimulating or driven by self-blame.\\n   \\nCNN: You write that repair can happen 10 minutes, 10 days or 10 years after a blowup. Why is it never too late for repair?\\n \\nKennedy: I’ve had people say to me things like, “I feel like I basically yelled at my kid for 11 straight years. I don’t think I ever really got to know him, and my kid is now 20.” So often parents sink into guilt and self-blame after not-so-great moments. That kind of thinking just takes away our agency. Instead, we can stop the “I’m an awful parent” spiral by taking action to make the situation better.\\n   \\n      I want parents to know that sometimes the smallest step in the direction of repair can have a profound impact on our children and our relationships. At the end of my TED Talk, I walk everyone in the audience through an imagined repair from their parents that really drives this point home. People tell me they get teary even just imagining their parent acknowledging something about some painful experiences in their collective past. That impact demonstrates it’s never too late to have a powerful repair with our children.\\n   \\n      We can be cynical: “Sure, like that moment is going to change everything.” No, it will not change everything. It will change some things, and changing some things is a direction toward change, and is even the direction toward changing lots of things. \\xa0I like to start with small moments that have big impact and get us walking down a new path. I promise you, there are things you can do today to improve your relationship with your child.\\n   \\nCNN: Does a parent’s regret need to be verbalized to bring about repair? What if the blow-up is followed by a snuggle on the couch or some other form of reconnection?\\n \\nKennedy: Maya Angelou said, “people won’t remember what you said or did, they will remember how you made them feel.” Instilling a sense of a repair helps kids go from feeling alone, overwhelmed and confused to safer, more grounded and more connected. Showing up to your kid with a snuggle after a rupture is a beautiful action. I would never tell a parent don’t do that, or that’s not enough.\\n   \\n      But the difference is, the feelings involved in the rupture moment still remain. Humans love stories. They’re in our nature. The only way we make meaning out of feelings is through stories. And in the absence of giving our kids a story to help them understand the rift, they’ll probably make up their own. Kids tend to default into self-doubt, which can look like “I always misunderstand things around me,” or self-blame, which can leave kids thinking their parent yelled because they’re unlovable.\\n   \\n      Instead, I urge parents to recognize the power they have to rewrite the stories our kids tell themselves by explaining: “Hey, I was having a hard time. I’m sorry I yelled. I wish I’d stepped aside to better manage my own feelings.”\\n   \\nCNN: How do you respond to parents who worry this approach won’t teach children that actions have consequences?\\n \\nKennedy: Instead of spending so much time on an action’s consequences, I recommend we focus in on what precedes an action we deem “bad behavior.” These behaviors have antecedents. If we can figure out what’s going on for a kid before the action, we have a much greater likelihood of changing it.\\n   \\n      Some people would say, “Well, your kid’s going to face the consequences in the real world.” My reply is, “No, my kid is not going to do that behavior in the real world, because they’ve learned the skills they need to change their behavior.” I don’t think kids decide to have bad behavior, like smacking their brother or saying “I hate you” to their mom. They’re overwhelmed by an emotion that explodes into behavior.\\n   \\n      Here’s an example I hear all the time: “I ask my kid a million times, calmly, to put on their shoes. When they don’t get on their shoes, I yell at them. What’s my kids’ role in that equation?”\\n   \\n      Examining what’s getting in the way of the kid listening is a more effective place to intervene. From that place I might say to my kid, after repair, “Hey, mornings are a disaster. It doesn’t feel good to ask you to do something a million times. I apologize for yelling yesterday. Even when I’m frustrated, it’s not okay to scream at you. I think we’d both like mornings to feel better. Let’s think … I wonder what would have to change to make putting on your shoes a little bit easier? I bet you have an idea too.”\\n   \\n      If you believe in your child as someone who wants to work with you, who is capable of solving problems, they will start to show you that goodness and become that kid.\\n   \\nCNN: What is the difference between repair and apology?\\n \\nKennedy: An apology can be used to shut down conversation: “I’m sorry I yelled. Can we move on?” A good repair opens up conversation. The most important focus of repair is the impact it has on the other person. When we repair with someone, we strengthen our relationship with them. At the end, it makes people feel like they’ve learned something new, have a better understanding and feel closer to the person. We can judge the difference by the feeling.\\n   \\nREAD MORE: \\ufeffSign up for CNN’s Stress, But Less newsletter.\\xa0Our six-part mindfulness guide will inform and inspire you to reduce stress while learning how to harness it.\\n   \\nCNN: Parenting often happens in pairs. What happens if one parent is working to repair while the other is not. Can one parent repair on behalf of the other?\\n \\nKennedy: We can repair on behalf of someone else. And we can do that without throwing the other person under the bus. Whenever I’m stuck for words, I say to myself, “Becky, just name what’s true.” I might say to my kid, “Hey, I heard Grandma (or) Dad yell at you earlier, and I’m sure that felt scary. It’s never OK for someone to scream at you.” Next, I would probably say, “Apologizing is really hard for your dad. And I think it’s because he feels so bad that he has trouble naming it and coming to you.” With this approach, nobody’s the bad guy. And my kid has a new understanding of the circumstances without interpreting the situation as their fault. Simply saying what’s true can bring relief for the whole family system.\\n   \\nJessica DuLong\\xa0is a Brooklyn, New York-based journalist, book collaborator, writing coach and the author of “Saved at the Seawall: Stories From the September 11 Boat Lift” and “My River Chronicles: Rediscovering the Work That Built America.”\\n',\n",

They are created through different peer groups, societal expectations and ideals of traditional masculinity that value hiding vulnerability over showing empathy.\\n   \\n      This is not a genetic trait, but a learned behavior. So how do we teach our sons to grow and become more fulfilled men? How do we bring the best out in our boys, so they become the best of men?\\n   \\n      This is the question that Dr. Shelly Flais answers in her new book, “Nurturing Boys To Be Better Men: Gender Equality Starts at Home,” which will be released on October 24. As a pediatrician and mother of three boys, she knows a lot about raising sons.\\n   \\n      “I’m all about doing little things early that then make huge impacts down the line,” Flais said. “I look at my sons and as they grow, (I ask) what kind of future do I want for them? We’ve come a long way (in how we raise boys),\\xa0but we still have so much further to go.”\\n   \\n      As the father of two sons, I know the pressure men and boys face to hide their emotions or pretend nothing is wrong. I don’t want my sons to be emotionally closed off or afraid to ask for help because they will be seen as less capable or confident. I think boys can turn into better men if we teach our sons that they don’t have to fight the world. They can instead choose to care for it.\\n   \\n      I spoke to Flais to learn her approach to teaching parents and guardians how to raise boys into emotionally mature men who can embrace whatever ideal of masculinity they choose.\\n   \\nThis conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.\\n \\nCNN: You recommend that parents and guardians should avoid phrases such as “Mr. Mom” or referring to dad as a babysitter. What is a phrase that we should be using with our young boys?\\n \\nDr. Shelly Flais: “I need help.” I think that the old-school notion of, and I speak for myself when I was a kid, I thought grown-ups had it all figured out. That they were smart.\\n   \\n      Now I know we’re all works in progress, and we’re all figuring it out by doing the best we can, given the circumstances at the time. I think it’s not only OK but healthy to show vulnerability, to show your decision-making process. It involves your children and it shows them that they’re valuable. It shows them that they have something to contribute and it’s something positive.\\n   \\nCNN: You’ve mentioned modeling as a parenting technique. What are some specific ways to model for toddlers to show them the traits we want to reinforce?\\n \\nFlais: Pediatricians are core lovers of the bedtime routine. I call those stolen moments. Grab that opportunity. What will that look like? And it might even be easier for a single-parent household to model these things because the kids witness that parent doing everything. That’s it. That’s the modeling, the witnessing of caregiving at work. Why can’t it be the dad’s job in your house? What a great opportunity to reconnect and play.\\n   \\nCNN: How do we show our boys how to deal with failure and stress in a healthy way?\\n \\nFlais: When they need help, we want them to speak up. Once, I remember it was a rough night. I had work and somehow, I had to feed the children. I threw a frozen pizza in the oven. I’m not ashamed of that. It happens. I don’t know what happened, but all of a sudden there were puffs of smoke coming out of my kitchen.\\n   \\n      And I could have gone to my room and freaked out, panicked. And I was very aware that there’s this army of young children viewing me, how do we deal with stressful situations?\\n   \\n      I chose to make light of the situation while fixing it. You want them to see how we respond to it and how we navigate it — that makes such a difference. I want my kids to know it’s OK to screw up. So, when they screw up, that’s OK. And we figure it out. We get solutions and we move forward.\\n   \\nCNN: One of the other techniques you bring up is overheard praise. What exactly is that and how do we make it part of our parenting toolbox?\\n \\nFlais: In the twin world, I go places with them, and people have a thought enter their brain. You would hear “you’ve got your hands full.” The implication is that my kids are a burden, and I take issue with that. And so, with practice — it didn’t come naturally to me — I smile and say, “They’re great kids.” That’s the overheard praise. And they hear that. It’s so simple but is efficient.\\n   \\nCNN: For our teenage boys, how do we bring them out to talk about their emotions? How do we get them to not shut down and walk away?\\n \\nFlais: I have three bullet points here.\\n   \\n      First is to be self-aware and look at how we interact with our sons. Did you do your homework? Did you take the trash out? Why didn’t you clean your room?\\xa0Who would want to talk to that taskmaster? Most kids are in school for six hours. If they’re in a typical American school system and they literally go from this to this to this, do this, do that. You’re seeing them for very small chunks of time each day. If you fill it with tasks, that inhibits openness and communication. So first and foremost, I would say to be self-aware.\\n   \\n      Next, be present. This doesn’t mean being in their face and asking questions. This means being available. While you’re just doing a task, your kid comes and talks to you, and you hear things about their day. I think that so often in communication, the emphasis is on the talking. Parents need to be self-aware to realize there’s value in the quiet moments and allow space for spontaneous contributions.\\n   \\n      Third, meet your child where they are. This includes video games. This includes whatever your child is passionate about. Go ahead and join in. Be vulnerable.\\n   \\nCNN: You recommend recognizing your son’ emotions. That can be a very hard thing for parents to do, especially when for some of our teen boys the default emotion may be anger. What do you recommend parents do?\\n \\nFlais: To come out on the other side of a feeling you first have to go through it. And step one is identifying it.\\n   \\n      First and foremost, identifying what’s happening here. What’s the real root cause? Pediatricians love to say that whenever a young child acts out, we’re always looking for the reason underneath the behavior. No young child wants to act out. It’s always a cry for help. It always is a notification that, hey, I’m missing something.\\n   \\n      Whether it’s a grown-up who’s acting out or a teenager, it’s always, if we’re going to talk about substances, that’s a version of self-medicating. What need does the teenager have that they feel the need to self-medicate with substances or alcohol when it could be met in other ways, other ways that are safer or legal? Because all too often it’s looking at the surface value of how it’s playing out. But what I would suggest is looking back two steps and seeing what led us to this question.\\n   \\nCNN: You bring up dealing with shame and self-hatred. That’s not talked about enough with boys. How do we guide them through those feelings and emotions?\\n \\nFlais: When I hear that, my pediatrician’s brain kicks into the reflex of safety first.\\n   \\n      If you are concerned about your son’s safety, if he has expressed to either you or a close friend an intent to hurt himself or others, that’s a medical emergency. Families need to call their doctor, call 911 and get him to the emergency room. So that’s my clinical brain.\\n   \\n      I felt the need to write the book because I’m all about what steps can we take earlier on\\xa0(in a child’s life) to impact our current situation. I’m hoping that mental health was discussed enough that it was an open subject and that (there is) the normalization of possible counseling at various stages in a child’s life. Or if the parent goes to counseling or therapy to let them know I’m going to therapy, and all too often it’s kept a secret.\\n   \\n      Be present for your son. Then take a step back and look at their overall schedule. Most American teenagers, they’re overscheduled. So, to circle back when your son is in crisis mode like that, evaluate the big picture. I think it’s so important for kids to know the value of downtime. That’s the important thing. If you slow down, are we talking about giving them peace to exist?\\n   \\nEditor’s note: If you or someone you know is struggling with mental health, help is available.

       "  'contents': ' \\n      When Snapchat announced last month that it had reached 5 million paying subscribers for its Snapchat+ service, it seemed like a stunning achievement. The milestone marked the halfway point to the 10 million subscriber number that CEO Evan Spiegel had just months earlier identified as a “medium-term” goal.  \\n   \\n      The service’s success in just 15 months after launching proved that despite Snapchat’s reputation as an app used mainly by teens, users are willing to cough up money for a premium experience on the platform. At 5 million subscribers paying $3.99 per month, Snapchat+ is set to earn around $239 million in annual revenue. \\n   \\n      That subscriber number is just a fraction of its overall user base of Snapchat, which has quietly become one of the world’s fastest-growing social platforms. As of the end of June, it reported 397 million daily active users — more than X, the platform formerly known as Twitter. The company’s challenge now is figuring out how to successfully monetize those users to turn around a streak of disappointing financial results. When Snap reports earnings next week for the quarter ended in September, it’s expected to post its third consecutive revenue decline. \\n   \\n      Despite having invented some of the most important social media features over the past decade — stories and filters — Snapchat is often thought of as an app mainly for young people with less reach and cultuiral relevance than rivals like TikTok, Instagram and Facebook. But Snapchat’s user growth suggests that the app remains among the most dominant platforms, even as (and perhaps because) it’s charting a different course from most competitors. As other platforms increasingly lean into discoverability and showing users entertaining content from people they don’t know, Snap remains focused on its longtime strategy of connecting users with their real-life social circle. \\n   \\n      “At the end of the day, you have a better time connecting with the people you care about most, and we want to make sure that those connections are enduring and that we can provide experiences to enhance them,” Jack Brody, Snapchat’s vice president of product, told CNN. “By focusing on that, we feel like we’re solving problems that real users face every single day, and creating real, differentiated value.” \\n   \\n      Still, revenue growth hasn’t kept pace with those user gains. In the first six months of this year, Snap’s sales dipped more than 5% compared to the year-ago period, and it posted an operating loss of $769 million. Snap’s (SNAP) shares are down more than 11% since this time last year. \\n   \\n      The sales declines come as Snapchat, like other platforms, works to update its advertising business to cope with changes to Apple’s app tracking policies. And it comes as the company funnels money into innovations in artificial intelligence and augmented reality.  \\n   \\n      Snap has also faced lawsuits from parents alleging the app contributed to their children’s mental health struggles or enabled them to buy illicit drugs, with sometimes fatal outcomes. (Snapchat says it has a range of safety features to protect young users, including restrictions on friend suggestions and requests from strangers, default privacy settings and parental oversight options.)\\n   \\n      Still, analysts say Snap’s user growth continues to represent a major opportunity for the company.  \\n   \\n      “In my view, there’s significant value for a company that’s growing its installed base at this level,” said Angelo Zino, senior equity analyst at CFRA Research. “At the end of the day, when you think about advertisers, they want to go where the eyes are.” \\n   \\n      Snapchat gained popularity following its 2011 launch for the ability to send disappearing photos to friends, with the option to add silly filters. Two years later, Snapchat launched Stories, where users could share a series of photos and videos to all of their friends that would be viewable for only 24 hours, creating demand for more spontaneous, ephemeral types of content across social media.  \\n   \\n      Since then, Snapchat has continued to expand, adding features like a “Discover” section with public content and the Snap Map, where users can see their friends’ locations and public posts from popular locations. The company has also invested in more ambitious, experimental projects like a selfie drone, which it discontinued following mass layoffs last year, and AR glasses, investment in which has also been scaled back. \\n   \\n      But its core mission is to allow users to have more private conversations with their friends. And that’s fueled an ongoing boom in its user numbers. Snapchat has grown its user base by more than 10% year-over-year for the past 16 consecutive quarters. \\n   \\n      “That interpersonal and small group focus is really important and appealing especially to younger social media users who don’t want to broadcast their entire lives to mass audiences,” the way they would on TikTok or Instagram, said Jess Maddox, an assistant professor at the University of Alabama who researches social media platforms and internet popular culture. \\n   \\n      Snapchat says that much of its daily user base is distinct from other platforms, according to a study of 10,000 users conducted on Snap’s behalf by market research firm GWI during the first half of 2023. The group found that 43% of the people aged 16-64 who used Snapchat did not use TikTok, and more than half of daily Snapchatters in the same age range were not using YouTube on a daily basis. \\n   \\n      “Snapchat was really kind of created as an antidote to traditional social media,” Brody said. “This was a platform for connecting with your closest friends, not everybody you’ve ever met … and because of that, people come to Snapchat for a very different reason than why they go to other platforms.” \\n   \\n      Market research firm Insider Intelligence estimated in a June report that Snapchat would overtake TikTok as the fastest growing platform worldwide as of the end of 2023. Already, parent company Snap said at its February investor day that it has 150 million monthly active users in North America — a figure that mirrors the number of users that TikTok says it has in the United States (although TikTok did not specify how often those users are interacting with the app). \\n   \\n      A major portion of that growth is coming from outside of the United States. Snapchat has, for example, made a big push into India, following the country’s TikTok ban in 2020. Users from outside of North America and Europe now make up more than half of Snapchat’s daily active user base and grew at a rate of 25% year-over-year in the second quarter of 2023, compared to 14% overall daily active user growth.  \\n   \\n      Snapchat’s task now: making a meaningful profit from all of those users.  \\n   \\n      “The biggest reason [for its financial challenges] is that when you think about Snap, they are largely a messaging platform, and it is extremely difficult … to monetize messaging platforms,” CFRA’s Zino said. Other major tech companies that operate messaging platforms, including Meta and Apple, don’t count on those services to generate significant revenue, if any.  \\n   \\n      What’s more, advertisers are increasingly looking to invest in so-called “direct response” advertising where users are immediately prompted to buy a product — advertising that is much more easily done on a platform like Instagram where users are already often discussing specific products and it’s easy to link to an advertiser’s website or push users to buy directly on the platform’s e-commerce section. Snapchat, by contrast, has traditionally leaned more heavily into brand awareness, said Scott Kessler, global technology sector lead at research firm Third Bridge, although the company now also gets the majority of its revenue from direct response ads.  \\n   \\n      “While there still is brand advertising online for sure, I think that there are a lot of challenges and a lot of conversations about what this looks like going forward,” Kessler said. “Snap is in a uniquely challenged position because of its historical focus on brand advertising.”  \\n   \\n      Snapchat has also placed a greater emphasis on user privacy than many of its peers — a boon to users but a challenge for advertising, Kessler noted.  \\n   \\n      Engagement time on Snapchat may also play a role — the app has the lowest user time spent compared to social media peers, likely owing to its focus on messaging rather than endless scrolling through content, according to market intelligence firm SensorTower. The average Snapchat user in the third quarter of 2023 spent just 19 minutes per day on the app, compared to 103 minutes per day on TikTok, 60 minutes per day on Instagram and 28 minutes per day on X, SensorTower data shows.  \\n   \\n      But Snapchat says its users are checking in on the app regularly — 40 times a day on average in the United States, according to Brody.  \\n   \\n      Spiegel said during Snap’s July earnings call that following its restructuring last year, which cut 20% of its staff, the company is investing heavily to improve its direct response advertising business. He added that the company’s active advertisers were up 20% year-over-year. \\n   \\n      And Brody says those investments should enable the platform to better capitalize on its user base.   \\n   \\n      “At the end of the day, digital advertising is built on reach and engagement, and we have been growing both steadily,” he said. “It’s been a transition year for us in terms of really rebuilding a lot of the foundational pieces of our ad platform and we’re seeing some really promising signs there. And these ad platforms improvements will allow us to truly capitalize on this opportunity … in the future.” \\n  ',\n",

The group found that 43% of the people aged 16-64 who used Snapchat did not use TikTok, and more than half of daily Snapchatters in the same age range were not using YouTube on a daily basis. \\n   \\n      “Snapchat was really kind of created as an antidote to traditional social media,” Brody said. “This was a platform for connecting with your closest friends, not everybody you’ve ever met … and because of that, people come to Snapchat for a very different reason than why they go to other platforms.” \\n   \\n      Market research firm Insider Intelligence estimated in a June report that Snapchat would overtake TikTok as the fastest growing platform worldwide as of the end of 2023. Already, parent company Snap said at its February investor day that it has 150 million monthly active users in North America — a figure that mirrors the number of users that TikTok says it has in the United States (although TikTok did not specify how often those users are interacting with the app). \\n   \\n      A major portion of that growth is coming from outside of the United States. Snapchat has, for example, made a big push into India, following the country’s TikTok ban in 2020. Users from outside of North America and Europe now make up more than half of Snapchat’s daily active user base and grew at a rate of 25% year-over-year in the second quarter of 2023, compared to 14% overall daily active user growth.  \\n   \\n      Snapchat’s task now: making a meaningful profit from all of those users.  \\n   \\n      “The biggest reason [for its financial challenges] is that when you think about Snap, they are largely a messaging platform, and it is extremely difficult … to monetize messaging platforms,” CFRA’s Zino said. Other major tech companies that operate messaging platforms, including Meta and Apple, don’t count on those services to generate significant revenue, if any.  \\n   \\n      What’s more, advertisers are increasingly looking to invest in so-called “direct response” advertising where users are immediately prompted to buy a product — advertising that is much more easily done on a platform like Instagram where users are already often discussing specific products and it’s easy to link to an advertiser’s website or push users to buy directly on the platform’s e-commerce section. Snapchat, by contrast, has traditionally leaned more heavily into brand awareness, said Scott Kessler, global technology sector lead at research firm Third Bridge, although the company now also gets the majority of its revenue from direct response ads.  \\n   \\n      “While there still is brand advertising online for sure, I think that there are a lot of challenges and a lot of conversations about what this looks like going forward,” Kessler said. “Snap is in a uniquely challenged position because of its historical focus on brand advertising.”  \\n   \\n      Snapchat has also placed a greater emphasis on user privacy than many of its peers — a boon to users but a challenge for advertising, Kessler noted.  \\n   \\n      Engagement time on Snapchat may also play a role — the app has the lowest user time spent compared to social media peers, likely owing to its focus on messaging rather than endless scrolling through content, according to market intelligence firm SensorTower. The average Snapchat user in the third quarter of 2023 spent just 19 minutes per day on the app, compared to 103 minutes per day on TikTok, 60 minutes per day on Instagram and 28 minutes per day on X, SensorTower data shows.  \\n   \\n      But Snapchat says its users are checking in on the app regularly — 40 times a day on average in the United States, according to Brody.  \\n   \\n      Spiegel said during Snap’s July earnings call that following its restructuring last year, which cut 20% of its staff, the company is investing heavily to improve its direct response advertising business. He added that the company’s active advertisers were up 20% year-over-year. \\n   \\n      And Brody says those investments should enable the platform to better capitalize on its user base.   \\n   \\n      “At the end of the day, digital advertising is built on reach and engagement, and we have been growing both steadily,” he said. “It’s been a transition year for us in terms of really rebuilding a lot of the foundational pieces of our ad platform and we’re seeing some really promising signs there. And these ad platforms improvements will allow us to truly capitalize on this opportunity … in the future.” \\n  ',\n",

       "  'contents': ' \\n      The fallout from the colossal implosion of Sam Bankman-Fried’s crypto business is still rippling through the digital asset industry nearly a year later.\\n   \\n      On Thursday, New York’s attorney general filed a lawsuit against three digital asset firms that were caught up in the collapse of Bankman-Fried’s empire last fall — Gemini Trust, Genesis Global Capital and Digital Currency Group, parent company of Genesis. The lawsuit accused the companies of lying to investors and covering up more than $1 billion in losses. \\n   \\n      The AG’s office said that an investigation found Gemini, the crypto firm founded by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, deceived investors about significant risks associated with a lending service it ran jointly with Genesis. The program, called Gemini Earn, marketed itself as a low-risk investment in which customers could lend crypto assets to Genesis while earning interest payments as high as 8%.  \\n   \\n      “These cryptocurrency companies lied to investors,” Attorney General Letitia James said in a statement. “And it was middle-class investors who suffered as a result.” At least 29,000 New Yorkers were among the 230,000 investors whose money was lost, James said. \\n   \\n      James’ lawsuit is the latest effort among US officials to crack down on the trillion-dollar crypto industry, which for years has operated in the shadows of traditional financial regulation. Crypto advocates argue that regulators have dragged their feet in establishing guidelines for digital assets, which they believe are distinct from traditional securities like stocks or bonds. \\n   \\n      In the immediate aftermath of the FTX crash, Genesis froze customer redemptions in its lending unit, citing market turmoil. The lending unit later filed for bankruptcy. \\n   \\n      According to the latest lawsuit, Gemini knew that Genesis’ loans were risky and, at one point, “highly concentrated” with Bankman-Fried’s crypto trading house Alameda Research. Bankman-Fried is currently on trial in federal court in New York, where he has pleaded not guilty to seven counts of fraud and conspiracy. \\n   \\n      “Gemini hid the risks of investing with Genesis, and Genesis lied to the public about its losses,” James said.\\n   \\n      The lawsuit also names former Genesis CEO Soichiro “Michael” Moro and Digital Currency Group CEO Barry Silbert.\\n   \\n      Gemini’s owners, the Winklevoss twins, have said Genesis owed more than $900 million to some 340,000 customers using the Earn program.\\n   \\n      The AG’s lawsuit follows another civil action brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which in January sued Genesis and Gemini for offering unregistered securities through the Earn product. \\n   \\n      Gemini responded to the latest suit Thursday with a statement on X (formerly Twitter), claiming that Gemini itself was the victim of a “massive fraud.”\\n   \\n      “The NY AG’s lawsuit confirms what we’ve been saying all along” — that Gemini, its customers and other creditors were lied to about Genesis’ finances. But the company said it “wholly” disagrees with the lawsuit. \\n   \\n      “Blaming a victim for being defrauded and lied to makes no sense and we look forward to defending ourselves against this inconsistent position.”\\n   \\n      A Genesis spokesperson said that “while there is no basis for the NYAG’s claims against Genesis, we have been cooperating with all authorities and intend to continue doing so.”\\n   \\n      “Genesis has not violated the law and continues to focus on maximizing recoveries for creditors in its Chapter 11 cases,” the spokesperson added.\\n  ',\n",

It also supports the hover feature, which allows users to preview and switch between different tools and app controls, when used with a 12.9-inch iPad Pro 12.9-inch (6th generation) and 11-inch iPad Pro (4th generation). The price is $79, down $20 from the second-generation Apple Pencil and $50 less than the original. \\n   \\n      The biggest change to the latest model comes to the charging system, which is noteworthy not only because the company has been resistant to making the switch for years but because it’s about to make charging that much easier for its customers.\\n   \\n      At its iPhone 15 event in September, the company announced all of its next-generation smartphones and new AirPods Pro will launch with USB-C charging. Apple previously switched its iPads and MacBooks to USB-C charging, but the push to finally add it to iPhones came less than a year after the European Union voted to approve legislation to require smartphones, tablets, digital cameras, portable speakers and other small devices to support USB-C charging by 2024. \\n   \\n      The first-of-its-kind law aims to pare down the number of chargers and cables consumers must contend with when they purchase a new device and to allow users to mix and match devices and chargers even if they were produced by different manufacturers. In doing so, however, Apple will give up control of its wired charging ecosystem, and identifying good chargers from bad ones won’t be obvious to many consumers.\\n   \\n      Although Apple does not break out its Pencil sales numbers, David McQueen, a director at ABI Research, estimates about 42 million have been sold since it launched in 2015, considering 420 million iPads have been sold since then (assuming 10% or fewer of these consumers have bought an Apple Pencil).\\n   \\n      “I’d have to think it’d be this low because of its relatively high price, high-end use case, and the availability of much cheaper alternatives that are capable of working with iPad,” he said.\\n  ',\n",

Since then, senior administration officials have suggested they needed to be adjusted due to technological developments.\\n   \\n      Raimondo, who visited China in August, said the administration was “laser-focused” on slowing the advancement of China’s military. She emphasized that Washington had opted not to go further in restricting chips for other applications.\\n   \\n      Chips used in phones, video games and electric vehicles were purposefully carved out from the new rules, according to senior administration officials.\\n   \\n      But these assurances are unlikely to placate Beijing, which has vowed to “win the battle” in core technologies in order to bolster the country’s position as a tech superpower.\\n   \\n      China’s Foreign Ministry criticized the Biden administration’s new rules Monday, before they were officially unveiled. \\n   \\n      “The US needs to stop politicizing and weaponizing trade and tech issues and stop destabilizing global industrial and supply chains,” spokesperson Mao Ning told a press briefing. “We will closely follow the developments and firmly safeguard our rights and interests.”\\n   \\n      As part of ongoing dialogue established by Raimondo and other US officials with their Chinese counterparts, Beijing was informed of the impending updates, according to a senior administration official.\\n   \\n      “We let the Chinese know for clarity that these rules were coming, but there was no negotiation with them,” the official told reporters. \\n   \\n      The tech rivalry between the world’s two largest economies has been heating up. In recent months, the United States has enlisted its allies in Europe and Asia in restricting sales of advanced chipmaking equipment to China.\\n   \\n      In July, Beijing hit back by imposing its own curbs on exports of germanium and gallium, two elements essential for making semiconductors.\\n   \\n      Shares of US chipmakers fell Tuesday following the announcement of new export controls.\\n   \\n      Nvidia’s (NVDA) stock closed down 4.7%, while Intel (INTC) slipped 1.4%. AMD (AMD) shares ended 1.2% lower.\\n   \\n      In its filing, Nvidia said the rules imposed new licensing requirements for exports to China and other markets such as Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Vietnam.\\n   \\n      The company said its A800 chip, which was reportedly created for Chinese customers in order to circumvent last year’s restrictions, would be among the components affected. \\n   \\n      However, “given the strength of demand for our products worldwide, we do not anticipate that the additional restrictions will have a near-term meaningful impact on our financial results,” Nvidia said.\\n   \\n      The broader US chipmaking industry is also examining the impact of the new rules.\\n   \\n      The Semiconductor Industry Association said in a statement Tuesday that while it recognized the need to protect national security, “overly broad, unilateral controls risk harming the US semiconductor ecosystem without advancing national security as they encourage overseas customers to look elsewhere.” \\n   \\n      “We urge the administration to strengthen coordination with allies to ensure a level playing field for all companies,” added the group, which represents 99% of the US chip sector.\\n   \\n      The measures are also being reviewed in Europe. On Tuesday, ASML, the Dutch chipmaking equipment manufacturer, said it was evaluating the implications of the rules, though it did not expect them “to have a material impact on our financial outlook for 2023.”\\n   \\n      During a call Wednesday about the company’s third-quarter results, ASML chief executive Peter Wennink said the updated export restrictions would affect between 10% and 15% of the firm’s sales to China. \\n   \\n      On Tuesday, the US Department of Commerce added 13 Chinese entities to a list of firms with which US companies may not do business for national security reasons.\\n   \\n      They include two Chinese startups, Biren Technology and Moore Thread Intelligent Technology, and their subsidiaries. \\n   \\n      The department alleges that these companies are “involved in the development of advanced computing chips that have been found to be engaged in activities contrary to US national security.” \\n   \\n      CNN has reached out to Biren and Moore Thread for comment.\\n   \\n— Anna Cooban contributed reporting.\\n',\n",

Separately, Bloomberg reported on Monday financial firm Jefferies said iPhone 15 sales dropped by a double-digit percentage following strong customer demand for Huawei’s new Mate 60 smartphone line.\\n   \\n      Apple\\n            \\n                (AAPL) shares fell 0.08% following the reports.\\n   \\n      The reports come amid a floundering Chinese economy, a struggling housing market, and more competition among higher-end vendors in China, particularly from Chinese device manufacturer Huawei.\\n   \\n      “We’re seeing a lot of nationalism right now as Chinese consumers who think they’ve been wronged by the US government and sanctions are gravitating toward the Mate 60 and that is edging into Apple volumes,” Jeff Fieldhack, research director at Counterpoint, told CNN.\\n   \\n      At the same time, China remains very important to Apple as it is the largest market behind the US. Fieldhack said he doesn’t believe Huawei will surpass Apple right now in terms of smartphone sales but expects continued interest in the Mate 60 will continue to “eek” into Apple’s numbers. \\n   \\n      “Apple made a lot of gains during its launch period last year, where it became number one in China,” he said. “Things looked strong but now, with the political tension and competition, that is a reason for concern.”\\n   \\n      However, the Phone 15 lineup is up about 10% year-over-year in the US, according to Counterpoint. That’s strong growth for Apple considering sales fell for the third consecutive quarter in August, ahead of the iPhone 15 launch. \\n   \\n      The latest iPhone 15 devices come with a slimmer design, a more-advanced main camera system and a customizable Action button, which gives the silence button additional controls, from starting a voice memo to writing a note. Perhaps the biggest change coming to the models is that they will now use a USB-C charging cord, ending an 11-year run with Apple’s proprietary Lightning charging cable.\\n   \\n      This isn’t the first time the Mate 60 has made headlines since its late August launch. In September, the US government sought more information about the Mate 60 Pro’s 5G Kirin 9000s processor reportedly developed specifically for the manufacturer. Its debut shocked industry experts who questioned how the company could make such a chip following sweeping efforts by the United States to restrict China’s access to foreign chip technology because of perceived national security concerns.\\n  ',\n",

In fact, there isn’t a basketball court or hoop in sight.\\n   \\n      Even as he was staking his claim in the 1990s as the greatest player the NBA has ever seen, the Bulls icon was a regular guest on the golf course. These days, though, he hosts.\\n   \\n      The Grove XXIII – a nod to his signature No. 23 jersey — is Jordan’s very own golf paradise, a private club tucked away on the outskirts of Hobe Sound, Florida. Ultra-exclusive, few have seen it, and even fewer have played it.\\n   \\n      For Bobby Weed, it was at once the most straightforward and most difficult brief he had ever received: “Build me the best golf course. Build me the best driving range.”\\n   \\n      And there had been plenty of briefs before.

       " {'headline': '\\n      Six bull sharks inadvertently made their home on an Australian golf course. Then they vanished\\n    ',\n",
       "  'contents': ' \\n      For golfers, staying out of the water could be the difference between winning and losing. At one course in Australia, it was the difference between life and death.\\n   \\n      Because Carbrook in Queensland boasted a membership unlike any other golf club on the planet: six resident bull sharks.\\n   \\n      From their mysterious arrival to their devastating disappearance 17 years later, this is the tale of the sport’s most hazardous water hazard.\\n   \\n      A lake on a landlocked golf course some 14 kilometers (8.7 miles) from the Pacific Ocean may sound like a swim too far for any fish, but the bull shark has a reputation for dipping its fins into a range of habitats.\\n   \\n      River shark, freshwater whaler, estuary whaler, swan river whaler – the clue is in its other names. While native to warm and tropical waters worldwide, bull sharks have organs specially adapted to retain salt, allowing them to venture deep into freshwater environments that would prove fatal to other sharks due to a loss of sodium.\\n   \\n      Hence the presence of the stocky-built, blunt-nosed sharks in the Logan River – which slices inland from the sea halfway between Brisbane and Gold Coast before meandering around Carbrook golf club – came as no real surprise to locals in the 1990s.\\n   \\n      Neither did severe flooding.\\n   \\n      Twinned with the region’s subtropical climate, the club has been a hotspot for floods since its inception in 1978, inundated with water on numerous occasions including in 1991, 1995 and 1996.\\n   \\n      The downpours were so torrential that on the latter three occasions, the roughly 100-meter land bridge separating the river from the sand-mine-turned-lake beside the course’s 14th hole was totally submerged. A new corridor was opened and – sometime during those three temporary windows – six bull sharks glided into uncharted waters.\\n   \\n      As the land bridge dried and reformed, the door slammed shut behind them. It would remain closed for 17 years, when the next severe flood event reforged a path to the river in 2013.\\n   \\n      Towards the end of the century, whispers began to trickle around Carbrook’s fairways – all originating from the 14th green.\\n   \\n      There were reports of loud splashes, large dark shapes moving below the lake’s surface, even laughed-off claims of a tall dorsal fin knifing through the water. “The Carbrook Shark” became a kind of folk legend, Australia’s own Bigfoot, Yeti or – most similarly of all – a local version of another famous lake-dwelling mythical beast.\\n   \\n      “The Loch Ness monster is pretty similar to what it felt like,” Carbrook general manager Scott Wagstaff told CNN.\\n   \\n      “It seemed possible but there wasn’t enough truth to it at that point.”\\n   \\n      That was until the early 2000s, when the Brisbane-based Courier Mail turned folklore into fact by publishing a picture of one of the sharks, Wagstaff recalled. Yet despite having played at the club for years, he had never seen them with his own eyes when he started work there in 2010.\\n   \\n      Determined to satisfy his curiosity, Wagstaff ventured down to the lake armed with his camera and some meat. No sooner had the bait hit the surface, a shark duly appeared.\\n   \\n      The stunned Wagstaff snapped some shots before taking a short video on his phone to post online. The footage was – by his own admission – “terrible,” but the internet lapped it up: the viral YouTube video has amassed more than 2.3 million views to date.\\n   \\n      Media interest boomed, and the club embraced its toothy tenants with vigor.\\n   \\n      A bull shark was added to the club’s logo, its youth program was named the Junior Shark Academy, and feedings were held at tournaments and corporate events – including one special wedding in 2009 where all six sharks appeared at once, Wagstaff recalls.\\n   \\n      Despite his affection for the sharks, Wagstaff was reluctant to call them pets, though he did nickname one “Patch,” thanks to its distinct back marking.\\n   \\n      Compared to the crocodiles and snakes dotting other courses in the country, Carbrook’s sharks made for extremely low-maintenance residents. Only two risk-management steps were taken: warning signage around the lake, and the rejection of any business from prospective golf ball divers, who retrieve balls from course lakes to sell them on.\\n   \\n      “It’s just not worth the few grand a year we get for a contract to put someone’s life at risk,” Wagstaff said.\\n   \\n      Fascination spread far beyond Australian borders, piquing the interest of one shark-loving scientist and researcher based at Ruhr University Bochum in Germany.\\n   \\n      Dr. Peter Gausmann published his study on the Carbrook sharks, titled “Who’s the biggest fish in the pond?” in the Marine and Fishery Sciences journal in August 2023. Their extended residence, he argued, sheds new light on just how adaptable bull sharks are.\\n   \\n      Even without the staff feeding the sharks, hunger was not a cause for concern in a lake 700 meters long, 380 meters wide and 15 meters deep, teeming with fish, from mullets to tarpons and snappers.\\n   \\n      Gausmann calculated that the sharks would need to consume half a ton of fish per year – or 0.44% of their body weight per day – to meet their energy needs. Having been juveniles when they arrived, sightings verified they had grown to a healthy range of between 1.8 and 3 meters by 2013.\\n   \\n      Only twice before had bull sharks been recorded surviving for years in isolated bodies of water, according to Gausmann, yet none had ever lasted so long.\\n   \\n      One group made it at least four years in Panama’s freshwater Lake Bayano in the 1980s, while another survived a decade of high salinity in South Africa’s Lake St. Lucia after becoming trapped in 2002.\\n   \\n      A stay of at least 17 years in low-salinity waters — more than half a bull shark’s lifespan — was unprecedented.\\n   \\n      “This out of the ordinary occurrence has shown verifiably for the first time how long bull sharks are able to survive in these low-salinity environments,” Gausmann told CNN.\\n   \\n      “The study has shown that bull sharks presumably have no limits to their residential time in freshwater environments such as lakes and rivers, and they are presumably – at least theoretically – able to spend their entire lifetime in these habitats.”\\n   \\n      Sadly for Gausmann and Carbrook, the true extent of their survivability remains unknown.\\n   \\n      It’s been eight years since a shark was last spotted in the lake. Their vanishing is a mystery, even to Gausmann.\\n   \\n      Sightings dropped in frequency after the 2013 floods, leading to fears that some sharks may have returned to the river or died as a result of the storm. Just two sharks were confirmed dead; one found floating on the surface, another killed by illegal fishing.\\n   \\n      Wagstaff, who had never noticed any sign of ill health among the sharks in more than 100 sightings, saw them only fleetingly after the fishing death. Gausmann believes it was unlikely the remaining sharks died in a “natural way” due to sodium loss or by any other “anatomical” failure, given their adaptability, and therefore theorizes that further illegal fishing is the “most likely” explanation for their disappearance.\\n   \\n      Whatever the reason, it’s an absence felt keenly by the club.\\n   \\n      “You can’t help yourself – you walk along the lake and you’re looking in, waiting to maybe catch a glimpse of a fin breaking the water,” Wagstaff said.\\n   \\n      “The members loved the fact that their golf course was their unique place in the world where we had sharks; they just embraced it.\\n   \\n      “We’d love to see them again.”\\n   \\n      Last year, the course was submerged by the biggest flood ever recorded in the area, Wagstaff said. Though devastating financially, closing the club for two months, it sparked hope that new sharks may have crossed from the river to repopulate the lake.\\n   \\n      Only time will tell, but Carbrook is already planning for a future without its mascot. Plans are in place to fill in the lake and build a new course there over the next decade, with all marine life – potential sharks included – subsequently relocated into waters elsewhere.\\n   \\n      Whether Wagstaff ever spots another fin in the lake or not, he will remember “Patch” and co. fondly as the guests who helped him overcome his fears. Once afraid of the ocean due to sharks, Wagstaff recently went scuba diving in the reefs of the Sunshine Coast to get up close and personal with some large grey nurse sharks.\\n   \\n      “There’s this kind of legend about sharks being aggressive because they’re coming into contact with humans, especially bull sharks because of the places they tend to swim – canals, creeks and rivers,” Wagstaff said.\\n   \\n      “But then to experience them in such close proximity and see how beautiful they are and how graceful they are – now I just find them fascinating, especially the bull shark.\\n   \\n      “They’re capable, so adaptive, and they are seriously beautiful when you’re a few feet away. It’s an incredible shark.”\\n  ',\n",

       " {'headline': '\\n      Six bull sharks inadvertently made their home on an Australian golf course. Then they vanished\\n    ',\n",
       "  'contents': ' \\n      For golfers, staying out of the water could be the difference between winning and losing. At one course in Australia, it was the difference between life and death.\\n   \\n      Because Carbrook in Queensland boasted a membership unlike any other golf club on the planet: six resident bull sharks.\\n   \\n      From their mysterious arrival to their devastating disappearance 17 years later, this is the tale of the sport’s most hazardous water hazard.\\n   \\n      A lake on a landlocked golf course some 14 kilometers (8.7 miles) from the Pacific Ocean may sound like a swim too far for any fish, but the bull shark has a reputation for dipping its fins into a range of habitats.\\n   \\n      River shark, freshwater whaler, estuary whaler, swan river whaler – the clue is in its other names. While native to warm and tropical waters worldwide, bull sharks have organs specially adapted to retain salt, allowing them to venture deep into freshwater environments that would prove fatal to other sharks due to a loss of sodium.\\n   \\n      Hence the presence of the stocky-built, blunt-nosed sharks in the Logan River – which slices inland from the sea halfway between Brisbane and Gold Coast before meandering around Carbrook golf club – came as no real surprise to locals in the 1990s.\\n   \\n      Neither did severe flooding.\\n   \\n      Twinned with the region’s subtropical climate, the club has been a hotspot for floods since its inception in 1978, inundated with water on numerous occasions including in 1991, 1995 and 1996.\\n   \\n      The downpours were so torrential that on the latter three occasions, the roughly 100-meter land bridge separating the river from the sand-mine-turned-lake beside the course’s 14th hole was totally submerged. A new corridor was opened and – sometime during those three temporary windows – six bull sharks glided into uncharted waters.\\n   \\n      As the land bridge dried and reformed, the door slammed shut behind them. It would remain closed for 17 years, when the next severe flood event reforged a path to the river in 2013.\\n   \\n      Towards the end of the century, whispers began to trickle around Carbrook’s fairways – all originating from the 14th green.\\n   \\n      There were reports of loud splashes, large dark shapes moving below the lake’s surface, even laughed-off claims of a tall dorsal fin knifing through the water. “The Carbrook Shark” became a kind of folk legend, Australia’s own Bigfoot, Yeti or – most similarly of all – a local version of another famous lake-dwelling mythical beast.\\n   \\n      “The Loch Ness monster is pretty similar to what it felt like,” Carbrook general manager Scott Wagstaff told CNN.\\n   \\n      “It seemed possible but there wasn’t enough truth to it at that point.”\\n   \\n      That was until the early 2000s, when the Brisbane-based Courier Mail turned folklore into fact by publishing a picture of one of the sharks, Wagstaff recalled. Yet despite having played at the club for years, he had never seen them with his own eyes when he started work there in 2010.\\n   \\n      Determined to satisfy his curiosity, Wagstaff ventured down to the lake armed with his camera and some meat. No sooner had the bait hit the surface, a shark duly appeared.\\n   \\n      The stunned Wagstaff snapped some shots before taking a short video on his phone to post online. The footage was – by his own admission – “terrible,” but the internet lapped it up: the viral YouTube video has amassed more than 2.3 million views to date.\\n   \\n      Media interest boomed, and the club embraced its toothy tenants with vigor.\\n   \\n      A bull shark was added to the club’s logo, its youth program was named the Junior Shark Academy, and feedings were held at tournaments and corporate events – including one special wedding in 2009 where all six sharks appeared at once, Wagstaff recalls.\\n   \\n      Despite his affection for the sharks, Wagstaff was reluctant to call them pets, though he did nickname one “Patch,” thanks to its distinct back marking.\\n   \\n      Compared to the crocodiles and snakes dotting other courses in the country, Carbrook’s sharks made for extremely low-maintenance residents. Only two risk-management steps were taken: warning signage around the lake, and the rejection of any business from prospective golf ball divers, who retrieve balls from course lakes to sell them on.\\n   \\n      “It’s just not worth the few grand a year we get for a contract to put someone’s life at risk,” Wagstaff said.\\n   \\n      Fascination spread far beyond Australian borders, piquing the interest of one shark-loving scientist and researcher based at Ruhr University Bochum in Germany.\\n   \\n      Dr. Peter Gausmann published his study on the Carbrook sharks, titled “Who’s the biggest fish in the pond?” in the Marine and Fishery Sciences journal in August 2023. Their extended residence, he argued, sheds new light on just how adaptable bull sharks are.\\n   \\n      Even without the staff feeding the sharks, hunger was not a cause for concern in a lake 700 meters long, 380 meters wide and 15 meters deep, teeming with fish, from mullets to tarpons and snappers.\\n   \\n      Gausmann calculated that the sharks would need to consume half a ton of fish per year – or 0.44% of their body weight per day – to meet their energy needs. Having been juveniles when they arrived, sightings verified they had grown to a healthy range of between 1.8 and 3 meters by 2013.\\n   \\n      Only twice before had bull sharks been recorded surviving for years in isolated bodies of water, according to Gausmann, yet none had ever lasted so long.\\n   \\n      One group made it at least four years in Panama’s freshwater Lake Bayano in the 1980s, while another survived a decade of high salinity in South Africa’s Lake St. Lucia after becoming trapped in 2002.\\n   \\n      A stay of at least 17 years in low-salinity waters — more than half a bull shark’s lifespan — was unprecedented.\\n   \\n      “This out of the ordinary occurrence has shown verifiably for the first time how long bull sharks are able to survive in these low-salinity environments,” Gausmann told CNN.\\n   \\n      “The study has shown that bull sharks presumably have no limits to their residential time in freshwater environments such as lakes and rivers, and they are presumably – at least theoretically – able to spend their entire lifetime in these habitats.”\\n   \\n      Sadly for Gausmann and Carbrook, the true extent of their survivability remains unknown.\\n   \\n      It’s been eight years since a shark was last spotted in the lake. Their vanishing is a mystery, even to Gausmann.\\n   \\n      Sightings dropped in frequency after the 2013 floods, leading to fears that some sharks may have returned to the river or died as a result of the storm. Just two sharks were confirmed dead; one found floating on the surface, another killed by illegal fishing.\\n   \\n      Wagstaff, who had never noticed any sign of ill health among the sharks in more than 100 sightings, saw them only fleetingly after the fishing death. Gausmann believes it was unlikely the remaining sharks died in a “natural way” due to sodium loss or by any other “anatomical” failure, given their adaptability, and therefore theorizes that further illegal fishing is the “most likely” explanation for their disappearance.\\n   \\n      Whatever the reason, it’s an absence felt keenly by the club.\\n   \\n      “You can’t help yourself – you walk along the lake and you’re looking in, waiting to maybe catch a glimpse of a fin breaking the water,” Wagstaff said.\\n   \\n      “The members loved the fact that their golf course was their unique place in the world where we had sharks; they just embraced it.\\n   \\n      “We’d love to see them again.”\\n   \\n      Last year, the course was submerged by the biggest flood ever recorded in the area, Wagstaff said. Though devastating financially, closing the club for two months, it sparked hope that new sharks may have crossed from the river to repopulate the lake.\\n   \\n      Only time will tell, but Carbrook is already planning for a future without its mascot. Plans are in place to fill in the lake and build a new course there over the next decade, with all marine life – potential sharks included – subsequently relocated into waters elsewhere.\\n   \\n      Whether Wagstaff ever spots another fin in the lake or not, he will remember “Patch” and co. fondly as the guests who helped him overcome his fears. Once afraid of the ocean due to sharks, Wagstaff recently went scuba diving in the reefs of the Sunshine Coast to get up close and personal with some large grey nurse sharks.\\n   \\n      “There’s this kind of legend about sharks being aggressive because they’re coming into contact with humans, especially bull sharks because of the places they tend to swim – canals, creeks and rivers,” Wagstaff said.\\n   \\n      “But then to experience them in such close proximity and see how beautiful they are and how graceful they are – now I just find them fascinating, especially the bull shark.\\n   \\n      “They’re capable, so adaptive, and they are seriously beautiful when you’re a few feet away. It’s an incredible shark.”\\n  ',\n",

       "  'contents': ' \\nSign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter.\\xa0Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\\n \\n      At first glance, the Herculaneum scrolls look unremarkable, like pieces of coal. After surviving the eruption\\xa0of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD, the nearly 2,000-year-old documents would crumble if anyone attempted to unroll them, and surviving pieces with writing were considered to be nearly illegible to the human eye — until now.\\n   \\n      After two millennia, the first full word from one of the unopened ancient papyri has been decoded with the help of computer technology and advanced artificial intelligence, according to\\xa0an announcement made\\xa0by\\xa0a team of researchers who launched the\\xa0“Vesuvius Challenge,” a competition designed to accelerate the discoveries made on the scrolls.\\n   \\n      The word, “πορφυρας” or “porphyras,” which is the Greek word for purple, was found first by University of Nebraska computer science student Luke Farritor, who participated in the contest, which calls for competitors to apply a technique known as “virtual wrapping” to two rolled-up scrolls\\xa0released on the site, in an attempt to decipher the hidden words.\\n   \\n      Virtual unwrapping begins with computer tomography, an X-ray procedure that is used to scan each coiled-up, warped papyrus. After following along the curved layers in the scan, researchers then virtually flatten the scrolls and explore them using advanced AI that has been trained to find the ink on the page. The technology was created by University of Kentucky computer science professor Brent Seales and has been in development for nearly 20 years now.\\n   \\n      But efforts to interpret the scrolls have been going on much longer.\\n   \\n      The 79 AD eruption of\\xa0Vesuvius, a volcano\\xa0located near Naples, Italy, covered the ancient Roman cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum in volcanic mud. Herculaneum and the scrolls remained buried until the city’s accidental rediscovery by a worker drilling for a well in the early 1700s,\\xa0according to the Herculaneum Society.\\n   \\n      Approximately 1,100 carbonized scrolls, now referred to as the Herculaneum scrolls, were recovered from a building that was believed to be Julius Caesar’s father-in-law’s house,\\xa0according to the University of Kentucky. The collection is referred to as the only known large-scale library from\\xa0the classical\\xa0antiquity.\\n   \\n      In the 19th\\xa0century, hundreds of scrolls were pulled apart by machine and the brittle papyri were left in pieces, according to the university’s website.\\n   \\n      Like many other Herculaneum papyrologists,\\xa0Michael McOsker, a postdoctoral researcher in papyrology at the University College London who was not involved with the discovery, has been studying the scrolls that were previously unrolled, which had caused the papyri to be fragmentary and hard to read, he said.\\n   \\n      “Obviously, there’s a long way to go before we can read a whole roll, which is the real goal, but I’m sure it’s a solvable problem now, and one that might not even take that long,” McOsker said in an email, regarding the recent discovery.\\n   \\n      “The unrolled papyri are rewarding and important, but it’ll be a quantum leap forward to have complete texts… I’m paralyzed by the number of options and just feel grateful for any new work from antiquity that we find. It’ll be so exciting to study whatever we find.”\\n   \\n      Farritor and Youssef Nader, a biorobotics graduate student at Freie University Berlin, worked independently of one another and found the same word. They shared the “First Letters Prize” of $50,000, with Farritor awarded $40,000 and Nader earning $10,000. But the grand prize of the Vesuvius Challenge — $700,000 for the first team that can read four continuous passages at the minimum length of 140 characters — is still up for grabs.\\n   \\n      Seales hopes that a partially read scroll, satisfactory with the contest conditions, will be seen by the end of this year, while a whole scroll might be deciphered by the end of 2024.\\n   \\n      “This material goes back 2,000 years — there were people who wrote this,” Seales said. “They wrote about love, they wrote about war, they wrote about peace, they argued with each other. These manuscripts are dialogues that they’re having about philosophical views of the world.\\n   \\n      “And so even if we learn nothing, but the deep connection that we have to the ancients in terms of humanity, that’s still significant.”\\n   \\nClarification: This story has been updated to reflect the breakdown of prize money won by Luke Farritor and Youssef Nader.\\n',\n",

       "  'contents': ' \\n      Idina Menzel has shared about some of the “very complicated” reasons she and Taye Diggs split in 2013.\\n   \\n      The “Wicked” star appeared on a recent episode of the podcast “Dinner’s on Me with Jesse Tyler Ferguson.” Ferguson explained that he went from being a fan of Menzel from her time starring in the original Broadway production of “Rent” to costarring with her in “Hair” and becoming friends.\\n   \\n      “Rent” is also where she met Diggs. The former couple married in 2003 and years later welcomed a son, Walker. \\n   \\n      Menzel told Ferguson that while they have always been supportive of each other, being in an interracial relationship brought them outside pressures. \\n   \\n      “The thing that came into play more, I would say, and he’s talked about it too, is the interracial aspect of it,” she said. “When you’re in the theater, it’s just not a thing. We all love each other, sleep with each other and [are] best friends with whoever wants to be, whatever sexual orientation.”\\n   \\n      But leaving the “cocoon” of the theater world was different, she said. \\n   \\n      “I think he had his own stuff to deal with, with that,” she said of Diggs. “It seemed like there was disappointment in the community with him because he was married to a little white Jewish girl from some show that we don’t even remember.

       "  'contents': ' \\n      Having passengers shuffle down the jetway and fumble their way into the cramped seats of a commercial flight is one of the most time-consuming, logistical nightmares that major US airlines execute thousands of times each day.\\n   \\n      Now, the airline with the most planes will start packing in passengers using a new method.\\xa0United Airlines says its six-group boarding procedure will be “improved to save up to two minutes of boarding time.”\\n   \\n      Starting October 26, United says\\xa0that after the initial boarding groups enter,\\xa0window seat passengers in economy class without frequent flyer status will board next. They’ll be followed by those in middle seats, and passengers in aisle seats will board last.\\n   \\n      The process, abbreviated as WILMA for window-middle-aisle, “was tested at four domestic line stations and one hub and it’s faster,” United said in a company memo to its customer service representatives.\\n   \\n      United’s change also means those who book window seats could have a slight edge for coveted and limited overhead bin space.\\n   \\n      “Saving even one minute in airplane turn time can sum up to several hundred million dollars per year for a large airline,” says John Milne of Clarkson University in Potsdam, New York. Milne’s co-authored more than 20 journal articles on the topic of airplane boarding.\\n   \\n      Milne says the time savings come down to better utilizing a key airline resource –airplanes – adding “particularly large savings for an airline result when the boarding time reduction leads to offering an additional flight during the day.”\\n   \\n      The move is the latest change in boarding procedures by a major airline in the United States.\\n   \\n      American Airlines switched to a nine-group boarding system in 2017 and made some tweaks to that system in 2023.\\n   \\n      Earlier this year, Southwest Airlines, which doesn’t assign seats,\\xa0announced changes to its three-group boarding system by limiting the number of passengers who could buy early bird check-in slots in order to snag a better seat.\\n   \\n      There must be a better way, right? Milne is an advocate of the “reverse pyramid” method with four boarding groups.\\n   \\n      The first is of passengers with window seats in the back half of the plane. The second is passengers with middle seats in the back half of the plane and window seats in the front half. The third group is middle seats in the front half of the plane and aisle seats in the back half. The fourth and final group is aisle seats in the front half of the plane.\\n   \\n      “The Reverse Pyramid method boards faster than WILMA and it remains simple,” Milne says. “If airlines can tolerate more complexity – and there is little evidence that they do – there are even better methods.”\\n   \\n      United’s new boarding procedure makes no changes to pre-boarding for those with disabilities or those with the highest level of frequent flyer status. Nor does it make any change to group one, which includes those in first and business class.\\n  ',\n",

The statement gives instructions to cruisers to contact the company, which will pay to reroute people to Amsterdam or Freeport, including covering accommodation and “itinerary.” \\n   \\n      “We understand this change is not desirable, but we are doing our best to accommodate everyone and keep this adventure on track, even if it is a little late,” they added.\\n   \\n      They said they expect to complete the purchase within a week. \\n   \\n      Meanwhile, some passengers are becoming increasingly concerned about the delays – and what they see as a lack of transparency from Life at Sea cruises.\\n   \\n      “We are all sitting on pins and needles right now – the uncertainty is excruciating,” said one resident (as passengers will be known), who wished to remain anonymous.\\n   \\n      “I’m okay with a delay, but I won’t be okay with a cancellation.”\\n   \\n      Another, who also declined to be named, fears the cruise will end up not departing at all, but says they feel “sad but proud that we signed up for such an amazing adventure.”\\n   \\n      “I just hope I get my money back if we don’t sail,” they added.\\n  ',\n",

       "  'contents': ' \\nEditor’s Note: Sign up for Unlocking the World, CNN Travel’s weekly newsletter. Get the latest news in aviation, food and drink, where to stay and other travel developments.\\n \\n      The forthcoming charge for travelers to enter Europe has been postponed – again.\\n   \\n      The ETIAS visa waiver program will come into force in 2025 – a year later than planned. \\n   \\n      On October 19, eu-LISA – the EU agency responsible for the forthcoming digital Entry/Exit system and ETIAS – informed ministers that they need more time to implement the changes. \\n   \\n      The Entry/Exit system – a central database tracking non-EU residents when they enter the block – will now come into force in the second half of 2024. Following that, the ETIAS program will start in the first half of 2025.\\n   \\n      When it does launch, ETIAS will allow entry into EU countries from $7.70. As the name suggests, it isn’t a visa – it’s a system for visitors from countries who don’t require visas to enter Europe, to preregister their visits. Those who currently need visas to enter will still need them.\\n   \\n      While many US citizens appear shocked by the move, they might be surprised that the ETIAS system is modeled on the ESTA visa waiver program, which was introduced in 2009 by the United States. And, of course, citizens of many countries need “real” visas to EU countries – which is not only a costly process, but a time-consuming one, too.\\n   \\n      ETIAS will join the myriad accommodation and “tourist taxes” that are already charged around Europe. Here’s what to know about them.\\n   \\n      Originally slated to start in May 2023, ETIAS has been pushed back several times – until now, it was down for a 2024 launch. That has now been pushed back – again – until 2025. You cannot make applications in advance, so there’s no need to worry about registering for your Mediterranean summer of 2025.\\n   \\n      Citizens of the 60 or so non-EU countries who don’t currently need a visa to the EU – such as the United States, the United Kingdom, Japan, Singapore and the UAE. EU residents are exempt, whatever their nationality.\\n   \\n      Those who currently need a visa to enter the EU, on the other hand, will still need a visa.\\n   \\n      ETIAS will be run along similar lines to the United States’ ESTA program. Travelers must request permission to enter the EU before their travel through a simple online process. \\n   \\n      It’ll cost 7 euros ($7.70) and will cover multiple entries for three years, or until your passport expires – whichever comes first. That’s cheaper than an ESTA, which costs $21 for two years.\\n   \\n      Applications should be processed in “minutes” with the vast majority completed in 96 hours, the EU predicts. “Some applicants may be asked to provide additional information or documentation or to participate in an interview with national authorities, which may take up to additional 30 days,” they warn, however. It suggests not booking flights or accommodation until you have confirmation.\\n   \\n      For more details, check out the official ETIAS website here – going through third parties may incur extra charges. \\n   \\n      Most cities in continental Europe now charge a “tourist tax” for overnight visitors – usually a few euros added to your bill at the end of your stay, though sometimes it must be paid in cash. If you’re staying in an Airbnb, hosts will often collect this from you on arrival. \\n   \\n      The taxes usually go towards buffering public services which are affected by visitors, such as trash collection and street cleaning. Amsterdam, for example, recently allocated an extra 7 million euros to its public transport network. They’re also usually only charged for a set period, usually of up to a week. That way, you’re rewarded if you stay longer.\\n   \\n      The notable exception is the UK – however, this is changing. Manchester became the first UK city to introduce a £1 ($1.30) tax on overnight stays in March 2023. Edinburgh looks set to follow, and Wales is looking to introduce a “visitor levy” for overnight stays.\\n   \\n      Then you’ll probably be paying an overnight tax wherever you do stay, since most European countries charge these taxes, though they tend to be cheaper in less popular municipalities. Don’t forget that tourism adds a heavy burden to destinations, often in countries and areas that are significantly poorer than those of the tourists themselves. \\n   \\n      Good question. Cruises are notoriously bad for the environment, as well as for cities who are engulfed by passengers on port days – passengers who spend precious little money in the destination as they’re already catered for onboard. \\n   \\n      Some cities have reacted by implementing arrival taxes on cruise passengers. If your ship docks at Barcelona for 12 hours or more you’ll pay 4.75 euros (3 euros regional fee and 1.75 euros city surcharge). Amsterdam visitors arriving on a cruise pay 8 euros. It’s only valid for boats that dock for the day – if your cruise starts or ends in Amsterdam, or if you’re staying overnight in the city, you’re exempt.\\n   \\n      It’s not just cruise ships that charge landing taxes for arriving by sea, however. Italy has the “contributo di sbarco” or disembarkation contribution that non-resident passengers must pay when arriving on islands, whether by public ferry or private boat. The price is set by local authorities.\\n   \\n      Yes – essentially, the more popular the place, the more you’ll pay. Stay in Barcelona, for example, and as well as the regular Catalonia tourist tax, you’ll be in line for a “city surcharge” imposed on stays in the region’s capital.\\n   \\n      Amsterdam charges 7% of the hotel rate plus 3 euros per person per night. \\n   \\n      In Vienna, it’s 3.2% of the total room rate, excluding breakfast and sales tax, and then lopping off 11% of the remainder. It works out as about 2.5%.\\n   \\n      In Portugal, three municipalities on the tourist-filled Algarve coastline charge tourist tax: Faro, Vila Real de Santo António and Olhão, which introduced a fee (1 euro in the winter, 2 euros otherwise) in 2023. \\n   \\n      Crucially, the posher your accommodation, the more you pay. In Rome, for example, staying in a three star hotel incurs a 4 euro nightly tax, but a four star hotel is 6 euros and five stars is 7 euros.\\n   \\n      In Venice, the tax goes from 1 euro per person per night in a one star hotel, to 5 euros in a five star. The tax is only payable for the first five nights, in a bid to get people to stay longer.\\n   \\n      And in Paris, it ranges from just 0.20 euros for a one star property to 5 euros per person per night in a swanky “palais” hotel.\\n   \\n      In France overall, the charges vary by both municipality and class of accommodation – ranging from 0.20 euros to 4.20 outside Paris.\\n   \\n      While in Greece, it’s done solely by the type of accommodation, with charges ranging from 0.50 euros to 4 euros per room per night.\\n   \\n      The much mooted “contributo di accesso” or entrance fee to Venice – which has been repeatedly postponed since first being proposed for 2019 – is now slated for 2024. Charges have been announced as starting at 3 euros on a quiet day to 10 euros at peak times. \\n   \\n      However, this charge is only for day-trippers, who are thought to form 90% of the visitor numbers, add little to the local economy but cause plenty of problems in the city. If you’re staying overnight, you’ll already have paid the overnight “city tax” and will be exempt. \\n   \\n      No. Many US states charge “accommodation taxes,” for starters – plus many US hotels add on a “resort fee” too, which doesn’t even go to the community. The taxes are also standard in the Caribbean, where they’re commonly added to hotel fees. There’s an entrance tax on tourists arriving in New Zealand, and a departure tax for vacationers departing from Japan.\\n  ',\n",
