       "[{'headline': '\\n      Suspect in Maine shooting rampage is dead from apparent self-inflicted gunshot, authorities say\\n    ',\n",
       "  'contents': ' \\n  Editor’s Note: Follow along with CNN’s latest coverage of the shootings in Lewiston, Maine.\\n \\n      A US Army reservist accused of killing 18 people and injuring 13 others in a shooting rampage in Maine this week was found dead Friday evening – apparently from a self-inflicted gunshot – after a two-day manhunt, a state official said.\\n   \\n      Robert Card, accused of committing Wednesday’s massacre at a bowling alley and a restaurant in Lewiston, Maine, was found dead around 7:45 p.m. Friday near the Androscoggin River in the Lisbon Falls area, some 10 miles Lewiston, state Public Safety Commissioner Michael Sauschuck told reporters.\\n   \\n      Maine Gov. Janet Mills said she is “breathing a sigh of relief tonight knowing that … Card is no longer a threat to anyone.”\\n   \\n      “Now is a time to heal,” Mills, who said Maine State Police found the body, told reporters at the news conference. “Tonight, the city of Lewiston and the state of Maine begin to move forward on a long road to healing.”\\n   \\n      Card’s body was found in an area near a recycling center from which he had recently been fired, a law enforcement source told CNN. Earlier this week, authorities had found Card’s vehicle abandoned after the shooting near a boat launch in the Lisbon area.\\n   \\n      Details about when Card died still were being investigated, Sauschuck said, and authorities haven’t announced a motive in the shooting. Authorities intend to release more information Saturday morning about Card and the investigation, they said.\\n   \\n      The discovery of Card’s body ends an intense two-day search that saw hundreds of officers scour parts of southern Maine by land, water and air, and finishes a period in which communities were simultaneously grieving and riddled with anxiety about the suspect’s location. Shelter-in-place orders for Androscoggin and northern Sagadahoc counties were in place from Wednesday night until they were lifted Friday afternoon, and schools, businesses and facilities were closed much of that time.\\n   \\n      Part of the reason the search for Card was expanded to waterways: Authorities found a note from Card that indicated that he did not expect to be alive when the note was found, a law enforcement official told CNN.\\n   \\n      The note essentially gave information to others about where things could be found and how things could be disposed of, the official said. Authorities had executed at least three search warrants Thursday on his vehicle, home and another property, the source said, which informed their search procedures Friday.\\n   \\n      Wednesday evening’s shooting was the deadliest US mass shooting since last year’s massacre at a school in Uvalde, Texas.\\n   \\n      Earlier Friday, multiple law enforcement sources told CNN the gun investigators believe Card used to carry out the massacre was purchased legally just days before he was hospitalized and ordered to undergo a psychiatric evaluation in July.\\n   \\n      In mid-July, New York State Police were called to Camp Smith in Cortlandt,\\xa0New York, the military base where Card served, because he was acting “belligerently and possibly intoxicated,” according to a source briefed on the matter. Three law enforcement sources confirm state police brought Card to a nearby hospital, where he was treated for suspected intoxication and released the next day.\\xa0When asked for information about the encounter,\\xa0a New York State Police spokesperson told CNN: “This is an active investigation, and the New York State Police does not comment on active investigations.”\\n   \\n      A federal law enforcement source told CNN the army gave Card a “Command Referral” to seek treatment after he told army personnel at Camp Smith Card had been “hearing voices” and had thoughts about “hurting other soldiers.”\\xa0A National Guard spokesperson confirmed to CNN Card was transported to the nearby Keller Army Community Hospital at the United States Military Academy for “medical evaluation,” after Army Reserve officials reported Card for “behaving erratically.”\\n   \\n      Card’s encounters with New York State Police and his National Guard superiors occurred just 10 days after Card had purchased the high-powered rifle at a Maine gun store, according to law enforcement sources. The rifle was a Ruger SFAR chambered for high-powered .308 ammunition, the sources added. The .308 round is favored by military snipers firing at long distances and big game hunters. It is larger and more powerful than the regular ammunition carried in the rifles of soldiers and SWAT teams.\\n   \\n      Sources say the weapon found inside Card’s 2013 white Subaru Outback appears to be the same one fired by the gunman at the bowling alley and a local bar, though a ballistics match has not been confirmed. The weapon will be processed by the FBI and ATF for fingerprints and DNA and then run through laboratory testing to determine if the bullets and shell casings found at the scene match.\\n   \\n      In the same July purchase, along with the rifle, sources say Card also bought a Beretta 92-F 9mm semi-automatic pistol. It is the standard pistol of the US military.\\n   \\n      The horror began around 7 p.m. Wednesday in Lewiston, where authorities say Card opened fire at Just-in-Time Recreation and then later at Schemengees Bar & Grille. Police were on the scene within just minutes of 911 calls made from the shooting locations, they said.\\n   \\n      In addition to the 18 people killed, 13 others were injured, the Maine governor said Thursday.\\n   \\n      Authorities identified all deceased victims Friday and said all their families had been notified. The oldest killed was a 76-year-old man and the youngest was a 14-year-old boy bowling with his father.\\n   \\n      The victims are Tricia Asselin, William Frank Brackett, Peyton Brewer-Ross, Thomas “Tommy” Conrad, Michael Deslauriers II, Jason Walker, Keith Macneir, Bryan MacFarlane, Ronald “Ron”\\xa0Morin Arthur “Artie” Strout, Joseph “Joey” Walker, Joshua Seal, Maxx Hathaway, Robert “Bob” Violette, Lucille Violette, Stephen “Steve” Vozzella, William “Bill” Young and his son Aaron Young.\\n   \\n      Authorities searched two days across southern Maine for the suspect. Before Card’s body was found, authorities Friday still were urging residents\\xa0across a 700-square-mile area to be vigilant as authorities raced to apprehend him.\\n   \\nLive Updates: Manhunt continues after Maine shooting rampage\\n \\n      Before Card was found dead, investigators had recovered a cell phone that belonged to Card, a law enforcement official said Friday. It added to the challenges for investigators, who routinely track cell phones to find suspects.\\n   \\n      During the search, a CNN team saw officers surrounding a greenhouse late Friday morning at Springworks Farm in Lisbon, which is less than a mile from a boat launch where Card’s vehicle was found. Officers cleared the scene by noon.\\n   \\n      And while the motive for the massacre remained unannounced Friday evening, a key theory about why the bowling alley and the restaurant were targeted emerged during the investigation, law enforcement sources say.\\n   \\n      Card recently broke up with a longtime girlfriend, and investigators are pursuing a theory that Card went to the bowling alley and the bar because they were places the couple used to frequent, law enforcement sources told CNN’s John Miller.\\n   \\n      Investigators believe the ex-girlfriend had signed up to play in a tournament at the bar Wednesday night, the sources said. According to the Facebook page for Schemengees Bar and Grill, Wednesday is “Industry Night,” which draws employees from other bars and restaurants in the Lewiston area.\\n   \\n      Now that authorities know Card is dead, a hunting restriction that was in place for four communities because of the manhunt has been lifted, Sauschuck said Friday night. The lifting of the restriction in Lewiston, Lisbon, Bowdoin and Monmouth comes in time for Saturday’s opening of Maine’s rifle hunting season. \\n \\n      Card was a petroleum supply specialist in the Army Reserve and first enlisted in 2002, according to records provided by the Army.\\xa0\\n \\n      Even though he was a certified firearms instructor, law enforcement officials told CNN, his time in the Army did not include training as a firearms instructor “nor did he serve in that capacity for the Army,” spokesperson Bryce Dubee said in a statement to CNN.\\n   \\n      Still, Card had extensive training, including land navigation, making him “very comfortable in the woods,” said Clifford Steeves, who told CNN he knew Card when they both served in the Army Reserve.\\n   \\n      He said Card is a skilled marksman who was one of the best shooters in his unit.\\n   \\n      Investigators searched the suspect’s car Thursday and recovered a .308-caliber AR15 rifle. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives will conduct tests to determine whether the gun can be matched to bullets and shell casings recovered at the two shooting scenes.\\n   \\n      Steeves met Card in the early 2000s when they served together and knew him until about a decade ago, he said. Steeves said he didn’t notice any concerning behavior from Card, who he described as an “outdoors type of guy.”\\n   \\n      “He was a very nice guy – very quiet. He never overused his authority or was mean or rude to other soldiers,” Steeves said. “It’s really upsetting.”\\n   \\n      Katie O’Neill, Card’s sister-in-law, told CNN he didn’t have a long history of mental health challenges.\\n   \\n      “This is something that was an acute episode. This is not who he is,” O’Neill said, referring to his July hospitalization. “He is not someone who has had mental health issues for his lifetime or anything like that.”\\n   \\nCNN’s Shimon Prokupecz, Andy Rose, Travis Nichols, Amanda Jackson, David Williams, Caroll Alvarado, Eric Levenson, Maria Santana,\\xa0Haley Brtizky, Joe Sutton, Sara Smart, Brian Todd, Macie Goldfarb, Maria\\xa0Sole\\xa0Campinoti, Chris Boyette, Sara Smart, and Zoe Sottile contributed to this report.\\n',\n",

       "  'contents': ' \\nEditor’s Note: Editor’s note: If you or someone you know is struggling with suicidal thoughts or mental health matters, please call the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline by dialing 988 to connect with a trained counselor, or visit the 988 Lifeline website.\\n \\n      When fighting broke out in Kang Hyeon-joo’s elementary school classroom, her heart would beat so fast she could not breathe and her vision would blur.\\n   \\n      “They were throwing punches and kicking faces, throwing chairs and tables around,” she recalled, adding she had been hurt trying to intervene.\\n   \\n      For two years, Kang struggled to discipline her students – or cope with the parental backlash when she did. She claims her principal did nothing to help and would tell her simply to “just take a week off”.\\n   \\n      The strain took a dangerous toll. Kang says she started feeling the urge to jump in front of a bus. “If I just jumped at least, I would feel some relief. If I just jumped off a tall building, that would at least give me some peace.” \\n   \\n      Kang is currently on sick leave but is far from alone in her experiences.\\n   \\n      Tens of thousands of teachers have been protesting in recent months, calling for more protection from students and parents. At one protest in Seoul last month, 200,000 gathered, according to organizers, forcing the government to take notice and action.\\n   \\n      The unified stand by the country’s teaching staff comes after the suicide of a first-grade teacher, in her early 20s, in July. She was found dead in her classroom in Seoul. Police have mentioned a problematic student and parental pressure while discussing her case, but have not given a definitive reason for her suicide.\\n   \\n      Several more teachers have taken their own lives since July and some of these cases have reportedly been linked to school stress, according to colleagues of the deceased and bereaved families.  \\n   \\n      Government data shows 100 public school teachers killed themselves from January 2018 to June 2023, 11 of them in the first six months of this year, but does not specify what factors contributed to their deaths.\\n   \\n      Sung Youl-kwan, a professor of education at Kyung Hee University, says the speed and size of the protests took many by surprise. “I think there has been like a shared feeling that this can happen to me too,” he said.\\n   \\n      Teachers point to a 2014 child abuse law, intended to protect children, as one of the main reasons they feel unable to discipline students. They say they are fearful of being sued by a small percentage of parents for causing emotional distress to their child and being dragged through the courts.\\n   \\n      “School is the last barrier to let students know what is okay in society and what is not. But we couldn’t do anything, if we teach them, we could be accused,” said Ahn Ji-hye, an elementary school teacher who helped organize previous protests.\\n   \\n      Ahn says parents have called her mobile phone some days from 6 a.m. until 11 p.m., wanting to talk about their child or complain.\\n   \\n      South Korea’s education minister Lee Ju-ho initially warned teachers that a mass strike would be an illegal act. That position was swiftly reversed, and a set of legal revisions passed the National Assembly on September 21, a fast piece of legislation.\\n   \\n      One of the key changes is providing teachers some protection from being sued for child abuse if their discipline is considered a legitimate educational activity. Also, the responsibility for handling school complaints and lawsuits brought by parents now rests with the principal. \\n   \\n      “So far we have a culture where the school principal tended to pass those responsibilities to teachers,” said Professor Sung.\\n   \\n      The new law will also protect teachers’ personal information, such as their mobile phone numbers, and require parents to contact the school with concerns or complaints rather than the teacher directly.\\n   \\n      In the past, Ahn said, “If I could not give my personal phone number to them, sometimes some parents would come to the parking lot and watch and see and take a note of my phone number from my car, then they would text message me.” It is customary for Koreans to display their phone number in the bottom corner of their windscreen.\\n   \\n      Ahn welcomes the legal changes as “meaningful,” but insists higher-level laws like the Child Welfare Act and Child Abuse Punishment Act also need to be revised. “It is still possible to report teachers based on suspicion alone according to these laws,” she said.\\n   \\n      She says that, for now at least, the protests will continue. \\n   \\n      One is planned for outside the National Assembly on October 28. Ahn says she would like to see penalties for parents who make unfounded accusations against teachers or practical measures put in place so that mandated changes can be adopted in classrooms, such as removing a disruptive student elsewhere to allow teaching to continue.\\n   \\n      Professor Sung believes the revisions will help in the short term, but cautions that the law should be seen as a safety net not a solution.\\n   \\n      Critics say South Korean society places a disproportionate level of importance on academic success so it should not be surprising that parents put teachers – and the wider education system – under so much pressure.\\n   \\n      It is the norm for students to attend a cram school, called hagwon, after their regular school hours, not as an extra but as a basic and expensive requirement to succeed. \\n   \\n      On the day of the national college entrance exam, known as Suneung in Korean, airplanes are grounded, and commuting hours are adjusted to ensure that students taking the exams are not disturbed.\\n   \\n      “We have a culture in which parents have usually one child and they are ready to pour every financial resource and opportunity into this child,” Sung said. \\n   \\n      “This pressure or obsession with education, sometimes with a high score, high achievement (mindset), is not a good environment for teachers (because) they are taking the pressure from the parents.”\\n   \\n      Sung says the days of a teacher being automatically respected are long gone, not just in South Korea but elsewhere in the world, and the teacher-parent dynamic is unrecognizable from just a decade or two ago.    \\n   \\n      “In educational policies, parents are regarded as like a consumer, with consumer sovereignty, and school and teachers are regarded as service providers”, he said, adding parents believe they “have the right to demand many things from schools.”\\n   \\n      In a country where education is considered central to success, teacher satisfaction is low. A survey by the Federation of Teachers’ Labor Union in April found 26.5% of teachers polled said they had received counseling or treatment for psychological issues due to their job. Some 87% said they have considered moving job or quitting in the past year.\\n  ',\n",

       " {'headline': '\\n      ‘Tombstone tourists’ find the beauty and joy in cemetery visits\\n    ',\n",
       "  'contents': ' \\n      Until she left for college, film historian Karie Bible spent almost her entire childhood living next to a cemetery.\\n   \\n      It’s where the Texas native rode her bike, played with her brother and passed by nearly every day. Other kids may have traded creepy stories about cemeteries or swore they’re haunted, but Bible was convinced of their value.\\n   \\n      “Being right next to a cemetery was normal for me,” she told CNN. “I always thought they were extremely beautiful.”\\n   \\n      Years later, after landing in Los Angeles as an adult, she ended up in one of the most famous cemeteries in the country: Hollywood Forever, a paean to Old Hollywood and the people who built it. There, visiting the graves of silent film star Marion Davies, famed director Cecil B. DeMille and ingénue icon Judy Garland, she found countless stories to tell.\\n   \\n      That was more than 20 years ago. She’s been the cemetery’s official tour guide ever since, leading visitors on monthly treks across the grounds to visit elaborate mausoleums, humbler headstones and various tributes to major stars and Hollywood everymen.\\n   \\n      “I love these people, and it gives me so much joy to keep their memories alive and their legacies going,” she told CNN.\\n   \\n      Bible spends her days with “tombstone tourists” — fans of cemeteries who travel across the country and world to significant cemeteries to commune with those buried there and bask in the history. (Philip Stone, founder and executive director of the Institute of Dark Tourism Research at the University of Central Lancashire in the United Kingdom, likened tombstone tourism to “sightseeing the mansions of the dead.”)\\n   \\n      Cemeteries aren’t conventional tourist destinations, but they’ve become essential stops for history buffs, aesthetes and curious visitors looking to learn more about the community they’re visiting. And “tombstone tourists” are always encouraging more to consider a cemetery’s the macabre beauty.\\n   \\n      “For me, a cemetery is like an art museum,” said Joy Neighbors, an author who writes  about her cemetery obsession in the blog A Grave Interest. “It’s always an adventure and always an experience to go in, dig around and see what you can find.”\\n   \\n      People often visit cemeteries for a connection to the past and to probe their own interest in death and the afterlife, said Sue Slocum, an associate professor of hospitality at George Mason University.\\n   \\n      Cemetery tourism is considered a form of “dark tourism,” or travel that involves visiting sites associated with death, she said. Dark tourism is predicated on a “preoccupation with death,” she said.\\n   \\n      “These are things that are part of being human,” said Slocum, who’s currently teaching a course on the subject. “(Cemeteries) celebrate community and the people buried there.”\\n   \\n      For the history-curious, cemeteries are rich resources. Tombstones themselves are monuments to the past and to the people buried beneath them, Neighbors said. Their design tells stories about the era in which they were produced — if it’s elaborate and well-kept, for example, it may mark the grave of a well-known and wealthy community member.\\n   \\n      Symbols on gravestones tell stories, too: In the 19th and 20th centuries, it was common for gravestones to bear symbols of religion or groups to which they belonged, like the Masonic square and compass. Children are often represented by lambs, Neighbors said, and some tombstones resemble trees from which limbs are cut, symbols of the deaths of family members.\\n   \\n      Even the birth and death dates can tell rich, devastating stories without words, she said.\\n   \\n      “It really makes you respect your heritage and the past,” Neighbors said.\\n   \\n      Many gravesites have become popular tourist destinations for their architecture, famous “residents” or historic significance: The Bonaventure Cemetery in Savannah, Georgia, is the Southern Gothic home to hundreds of Confederate soldiers and men who fought in the Spanish-American War, along with members of Savannah’s prominent 19th-century families. St. Mary Magdalene Churchyard in East Ham outside of London was a Roman burial site, discovered in the 19th century after hundreds of years of dormancy. And New Orleans’ St. Louis Cemetery No. 1 is home to dozens of locals who’ve since become urban legends, such as Voodoo queen Marie Laveau.\\n   \\n      “Cemeteries kind of have personalities,” Bible said. “They all have their own set of history and style — none of them are really the same experience.”\\n   \\n      In some places, Neighbors said, cemeteries function almost like parks: In Edinburgh, Scotland, the Greyfriars Kirkyard cemetery is open 24 hours a day, and people visit to knit, read, eat lunch and meet friends around its historic tombstones. (It’s also the home of the memorial for Greyfriars Bobby, a terrier who was said to have stood guard at his owner’s grave for 14 years. Visitors often bring him a stick to play fetch, Neighbors said — a way to “draw people in” to a cemetery instead of casting them out.)\\n   \\n      “To me, that’s what a cemetery should be,” she said.\\n   \\n      Bible sees her fair share of unruly cemetery guests: “There’s a reason why they have bike racks around Jim Morrison’s (grave),” she said, noting the barriers at Père Lachaise cemetery in Paris that surround The Doors’ frontman’s headstone.\\n   \\n      She has sympathy, though, for people whose interest in cemeteries is complicated. Sometimes, a visit to a cemetery can revive painful memories or pangs of grief for a lost loved one, she said.\\n   \\n      Cemeteries have often been considered places of quiet reverence, not venues for tourism or leisure. It’s a “very American concept” to maintain an air of solemnity in cemeteries, Slocum said. For years it was considered almost “sacrilegious to (visit) just to enjoy it,” Neighbors said.\\n   \\n      “You held your breath when you passed the cemetery,” Neighbors said of her grandparents’ view.\\n   \\n      Increasingly, though, historic cemeteries across the country and world are encouraging visitors to tour the grounds and learn the stories of the people buried there. Neighbors said she’s noticed families, joggers, even musicians start to spend time regularly at her local cemeteries when that was rare even 10 years ago. Some, like Atlanta’s Oakland Cemetery, have become community hubs where people walk their dogs or picnic — not just tourist destinations but resident mainstays.\\n   \\n      “People started realizing this is a gorgeous location we can utilize for other things than just visiting the dead,” Neighbors said. “There’s a wealth of experiences waiting to be discovered.”\\n   \\n      “There is a way to maintain your respect and curiosity,” Bible said of visiting a cemetery. “I think if you go in with the right attitude and realize why you’re there, there’s absolutely a way.”\\n   \\nGo with a purpose.\\xa0\\n \\n      Cemeteries are sites for reflection and remembrance, not so much for littering, loitering or partying like the doomed teens of many a scary story. While you can visit public cemeteries on your own, many offer tours to teach visitors about its history and some of the people buried there — Slocum suggested taking a guided tour of a cemetery to get the most out of the experience.\\n   \\nRespect the space.\\xa0\\n \\n      Even some of the best-known gravesites are working cemeteries, like Hollywood Forever, which still hosts funerals and performs burials and cremation services. It’s best to enter cemeteries, even those that offer tours or events, peacefully in case there are active funereal services taking place, Bible said.\\n   \\n      So, even on a tour themed to Halloween that leans into the spookier elements of cemeteries, it’s important to maintain “common decency for the dead, victims and their families,” Stone said.\\n   \\nDon’t tread where unwelcome.\\n \\n      Not all cemeteries appreciate guests. If a gravesite is private or culturally significant and discourages visiting if you’re not a community member, it’s best to heed that guidance, Slocum said.\\n  ',\n",

       "  'contents': ' \\n  Editor’s Note: A version of this story appears in CNN’s Meanwhile in the Middle East newsletter, a three-times-a-week look inside the region’s biggest stories.\\xa0Sign up here.\\n \\n      A day after Palestinian militant group Hamas launched its brutal attack on Israel, a curious video emerged out of Tehran’s Azadi stadium. Hundreds of soccer fans, gathered to watch a match between Perspolis FC and Gol Gohar Sirjan FC, chanted in unison: “Shove the Palestinian flag up your a**.”\\n   \\n      The vulgar protest came in response to officials attempting to raise a Palestinian flag in the stadium to show support for the October 7 attack. But for the fans, it was another unwelcome mixing of politics and soccer, and a stark reminder of the Iranian government’s involvement in proxy battles in far-flung arenas.\\n   \\n      Hamas’ attack, which killed 1,400 people according to Israeli authorities, prompted a fierce aerial campaign on Gaza that has so far killed more than 7,000 people, according to the health ministry in Hamas-controlled Gaza. And there are now concerns that more fronts will open in the war, including one with Iran.\\n   \\n      Experts say that while Iran is wary of being dragged into the Israel-Hamas war, it may not be in full control if the militias it backs in the region independently intervene as Hamas suffers heavy blows and the death toll in Gaza continues to mount.\\n   \\n      “What connects all these groups to Iran is their anti-Israel policies,” said Sima Shine, head of the Iran program at the Institute for National Security Studies (INSS) in Tel Aviv, noting that while Iran has varying levels of influence over the groups, it doesn’t dictate all their actions.\\n   \\n      In the early days after the October 7 attack, questions were raised about Iran’s potential involvement in the killings. Tehran at the time commended the operation but was quick to deny any hand in it . Initial US intelligence also suggested that Iranian officials were surprised by Hamas’ attack, and that Tehran was not directly involved in its planning, resourcing or approval, CNN has reported.\\n \\n      Despite its denial, however, Iran has ramped up its rhetoric against its arch enemy.\\n   \\n      Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian has warned that Israel’s bombardment of Gaza could have far-reaching consequences, saying that if Israel does not halt its airstrikes, “it is highly probable that many other fronts will be opened.”\\n   \\n      “This option is not ruled out and this is becoming increasingly more probable,” he told Al Jazeera last week.\\n   \\n      On Monday Abdollahian said the US has sent Iran two messages regarding escalation in the region.\\n   \\n      “The first message said that the United States is not interested in expanding the war, and the second message asked Iran to have self-restraint and insisted that Iran should also ask other countries and other sides to have self-restraint,” Abdollahian said during a news conference in Tehran Monday, without saying how and when the messages were delivered.\\n   \\n      He added that while the US says it wants to de-escalate, it has contradicted itself by continuing to support Israel.\\n   \\n      Trita Parsi, vice-president of the Quincy Institute in Washington, DC, said there is no appetite or desire from either Iran, the US or Israel for a wider war, but that Washington’s failure to restrain Israel may inadvertently drive the region towards escalation.\\n   \\n      US President Joe Biden last week pledged continued support for Israel, which has hardened Arab sentiment across the region and translated to mass protests against Israeli and American policies.\\n   \\n      “The only actor that has a clear interest in (a wider conflict) is Hamas, given that an enlargement of the war could change the dynamics in a favorable way for them,” Parsi said. In the absence of US efforts to rein in Israel, “many (regional) actors are going to feel compelled to step in… because of their own strategic calculations.”\\n   \\n      “When Israel is mobilizing 300,000 (troops), it is not likely that Hezbollah is going to sit there and assume that this is done only to go after Hamas,” he said, adding that it will factor in the risk of Israel going after the Lebanese group as well.\\n   \\n      An Iran-backed armed group and powerful regional force, Hezbollah has been trading fire with Israel’s military since the October 7 attack by Hamas. The fighting has been the worst since the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war, but it has so far been restricted to the border between Lebanon and Israel.\\n   \\n      Israel’s defense minister last week said that Israel was not interested in another war with Hezbollah. Israel has nonetheless turned the area of 4-kilometer radius near its border into a closed military zone, and evacuated residents from 28 communities within 2 kilometers of the Lebanese border.\\n   \\n      Hezbollah’s influence spans beyond Lebanon, however. It also operates alongside Iran’s elite Revolutionary Guard Corps in Syria, where the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights separates Israel from Tehran-aligned fighters.\\n   \\n      The Lebanese group also has its own channels with Hamas. Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah met Wednesday with top officials from Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, it said in a statement, without revealing where the meeting took place.\\n   \\n      “An assessment was made of…what the parties of the resistance axis must do at this sensitive stage to achieve a real victory for the resistance in Gaza and Palestine and to stop the treacherous and brutal aggression against our people,” it said.\\n   \\n      The Hamas-Israel conflict has also led to skirmishes in Syria and Iraq, from which Iran-backed militias have launched multiple drone attacks on US forces. And the US now has specific intelligence that those same groups could escalate even further as the war between Israel and Hamas continues, CNN reported this week.\\n \\n      The US continues to warn Tehran against taking advantage of the current situation or encouraging its proxies to escalate. On Tuesday, Secretary of State Antony Blinken urged the United Nations Security Council to warn Iran against any further involvement.\\n   \\n      “Tell Iran, tell its proxies in public, in private, through every means: Do not open another front against Israel in this conflict. Do not attack Israel’s partners,” Blinken said, noting that a “broader conflict would be devastating, not only for Palestinians and Israelis, but for people across the region, and indeed, around the world.”\\n   \\n      The US on Thursday carried out airstrikes targeting two facilities linked to Iranian-backed militias in eastern Syria, according to a statement from Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin. The strikes\\xa0came after a series of drone and rocket attacks against US forces in the region. The statement said the targeted facilities have been used by Iran’s IRGC and affiliated groups.\\n   \\n      Shine, of the INSS, said that Iran does not want a direct war with Israel because that would mean a direct war with the US. “It is very obvious that Iran does not want to be directly involved, and would prefer that (only) the proxies are involved.”\\n   \\n      But that may not play out exactly how Iran wants, added Shine, who previously served in the Israeli intelligence community for most of her career.\\n   \\n      “Iran has to take into account that the world is not operating according to what Iran decides or wants,” she told CNN. “So, if they decide to use their proxies too much, they might find themselves in a war they don’t want.”\\n   \\n      Parsi of the Quincy Institute said that the Iranian government is nonetheless preparing its population for war.\\n   \\n      Iranian media has been brimming with news of the Gaza war, with officials across Iran’s political spectrum expressing solidarity with Palestinians.\\n   \\n      “They’re already preparing the public opinion for this eventuality by essentially trying to make the argument that this is something that is brought to their doorstep because of what the Israelis are doing and because of the American support for it,” Parsi said.\\n   \\n      This shows there are already concerns in the Iranian government about how citizens will react to a war in which Iran is directly involved, he added.\\n   \\n      Even if there is a widener war that is still “below the threshold of a direct US-Iran engagement” – where it is restricted to Iranian proxies fighting Israel – it would still be an extremely unstable situation, he said. “No one can even control the current situation and make sure it doesn’t escalate.”\\n   \\nGo deeper into the biggest stories and trends in the Middle East and what they mean for your world.

       " {'headline': '\\n      Israeli ground forces inside Gaza as Palestinians take stock after intense overnight bombardment\\n    ',\n",
       "  'contents': ' \\n      Israeli ground forces are inside Gaza after entering the enclave overnight, as Palestinians experienced what they have described as the most intense round of airstrikes since Israel began its retaliation against Hamas’ October 7 terror attack.\\n   \\n      Israeli forces “went into the Gaza Strip and expanded the ground operation where infantry, armor and engineer units and artillery with heavy fire are taking part,” Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said Saturday morning during a press briefing in Tel Aviv.\\n   \\n      “The forces are in the field and continue the fighting,” he added, without giving further details.\\n   \\n      Hagari’s words confirm the military operation has undergone a significant expansion after what it had earlier described as two “targeted raids,” which took place on Wednesday night and Thursday night. Both those raids saw ground forces withdraw after a few hours.\\n   \\n      However, it does not appear as though any major ground offensive aimed at seizing and holding significant amounts of the territory is yet underway.\\n   \\n      Near the Gaza border, staging grounds once teeming with hundreds of Israeli tanks, armored personnel carriers and bulldozers have mostly emptied out.\\n   \\n      The signs of Israel’s incursion into northern Gaza overnight were clearly visible when a CNN team visited multiple staging grounds north of the strip.\\n   \\n      Near the staging grounds, north-south tread marks on the surrounding roads marked the routes where tanks charged forward toward Gaza. Fields once teeming with vehicles were largely filled with the trash left behind by troops given orders to mobilize.\\n   \\n      CNN also observed some tank units returning from the direction of Gaza, back to their forward operating positions.\\n   \\n      The IDF said on Saturday that its warplanes hit 150 underground targets in the north of the enclave, striking what it called terror tunnels and underground combat spaces and killing several Hamas operatives.\\n   \\n      Hagari said Gazans who had moved south of Wadi Gaza, a waterway bisecting the center of the strip, were in an area he called a “protected space,” and would receive more food, water and medicine today, though he did not give any details.\\n   \\n      More than 2 million people live in the enclave, which spans just 140 square miles and is one of the most densely-populated places on Earth. For weeks, people living in the territory have faced Israeli airstrikes and a growing humanitarian situation, with shortages of water, food and fuel.\\n   \\n      At least 7,650 people have been killed and more than 19,450 more injured in Israeli attacks on\\xa0Gaza\\xa0since October 7, according to the latest figures released by the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Ramallah, drawn from sources in the Hamas-controlled enclave.\\n   \\n      Gazans mourned the loss of their loved ones on Saturday following a night of intense Israeli airstrikes, with many gathering at Al Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir al Balah in central Gaza.\\n   \\n      Video captured by CNN shows multiple bodies, including those of children, covered in white shrouds or thick blankets, placed on the ground in the hospital yard.\\n   \\n      Dr. Khalil Al-Dikran told CNN the hospital had received 22 bodies overnight and hundreds of injured. He said people had brought the dead and the wounded to hospital using everything from bikes, cars and donkey carts.\\n   \\n      Hospitals have lost contact with each other, he said, after communications networks were cut across the strip. “People are desperate to find some news about their loved ones and their families,” he added.\\n   \\n      Al-Dikran said that after a pause of several hours, airstrikes had resumed again in central and northern Gaza, adding that artillery fire had continued uninterrupted through the night.\\n   \\n      The IDF on Saturday conducted heavy artillery strikes against northern Gaza, with multiple explosions heard every minute.\\n   \\n      A CNN team on the ground at an Israeli checkpoint near the strip perimeter witnessed intense and continuous explosions and air power. Smoke could also be seen rising from the enclave. Some of the explosions were so strong that the impact could be felt physically where the team was, around a kilometer (less than a mile) from the border.\\n   \\n      The IDF reserve soldiers manning the position told CNN that Friday night was by far the most intense night of bombing.\\n   \\n      Israeli troops have cleared out a large perimeter around the Gaza Strip, fearing incoming anti-tank weapons.\\n   \\n      Communications in the enclave have been severely disrupted, leaving aid agencies out of touch with their staff on the ground.\\n   \\n      The World Health Organization’s (WHO) Director-General, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter, on Saturday morning that reports of the intense bombardment are “extremely distressing.” He added: “We are still out of touch with our staff and health facilities. I’m worried about their safety.”\\n   \\n      He said that it is “not possible” to evacuate patients or find safe shelter under such circumstances, and the “blackout is also making it impossible for ambulances to reach the injured.”\\n   \\n      The WHO posted on social media that health workers, patients and civilians in Gaza spent the night “in darkness and fear” as they were “subject to a total communication and electrical blackout.”\\n   \\n      The organization said hospitals across Gaza are operating at maximum capacity, unable to take in new patients whilst also “sheltering thousands of civilians.”\\n   \\n      “There are more [people] wounded every hour,” the WHO said. “But ambulances cannot reach them in the communications blackout. Morgues are full. More than half of the dead are women and children.”\\n   \\n      It reiterated a call for “immediate humanitarian ceasefire,” adding that safe passage must also be ensured for “desperately needed medical supplies, fuel, water and food into and across Gaza.”\\n   \\n      Several United Nations agencies have also reported losing contact with their local staff in Gaza.\\n   \\n      Lynn Hastings, the United Nations Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator in Palestine, took to X to say that “Gaza has lost contact with the outside world amid reports of intensified bombardment.”\\n   \\n      UNICEF’s executive director Catherine Russell said in a post on X that she is “extremely concerned” about her team in Gaza after losing touch with them.\\n   \\n      “All humanitarians and the children and families they serve MUST be protected,” Russell added.\\n   \\n      While communications are largely severed, according to the local telecoms provider Jawwal, those with Israeli or international SIMs appear to have some patchy connections.\\n   \\nThis story is developing and will be updated. \\n',\n",

       " {'headline': '\\n      ‘You get home and then start crying’: Israel’s body collectors encounter horrors beyond their worst nightmares\\n    ',\n",
       "  'contents': ' \\nEditor’s Note: The following story includes graphic material. Audience discretion is advised.\\n \\n      Yanir Ishay has thrown away three boxes of cigarettes in the past two weeks.\\n   \\n      He said he thought he could smell death on them, having carried the packets in his pockets while collecting human remains from the sites of Hamas’ terror attack in southern Israel. Then his wife told him they were brand new — he’d just bought them.\\n   \\n      “That’s when I realized the smell was in my mind, not in the box,” he told CNN.\\n   \\n      Ishay is one of 120 volunteers – all of them men – working with ZAKA, a religious search and rescue organization, to recover the bodies of people killed near the Israel-Gaza perimeter by Hamas militants on October 7. Israeli authorities say more than 1,400 people were killed in the attack.\\n   \\n      In response, Israel declared war on Hamas, pounding Gaza with airstrikes that have killed more than 6,850 Palestinians, according to information published by the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Ramallah, drawn from sources in the Hamas-controlled enclave.\\n   \\n      Weeks on, as the war continues to rage, ZAKA volunteers are still collecting remains.\\n   \\n      “With all the preparations and with all the experience, never in our worst nightmares have we ever imagined we would see anything like what we have seen here,” Snir Elmalih, a longtime ZAKA member, told CNN at a cemetery in Ashdod, where he was working on Friday.\\n   \\n      He and other volunteers told CNN the\\xa0victims of the massacre included whole families, little children, babies, even pregnant women, and that their bodies were found in a horrific state – mutilated and burnt.\\n   \\n      ZAKA\\xa0has long worked in Israel and around the world, responding to terror attacks, accidents and disasters. Most of its members are deeply religious orthodox Jewish men and their mission is driven by the desire to ensure everyone, no matter what the circumstances of their death, can get a proper Jewish burial.\\n   \\n      “We believe that the respect for the dead is no less important – and sometimes more important – than the respect for the living,” Elmalih said. “We know how significant the idea of burying the dead is because God himself was involved in the burial of Moses.”\\n   \\n      On Friday morning, Elmalih was working at a cemetery in Ashdod, a city about 20 miles north of the Gaza Strip. A row of freshly dug graves in the burial grounds gets longer and longer each day, as more victims are identified and laid to rest. The cemetery has received so many bodies in the past two weeks that Elmalih needed to bring in extra refrigerated storage.\\n   \\n      He was preparing yet another funeral when Yossi Landau, one of ZAKA’s founding members, came by to say hello and drop off a care package. They spent a few minutes chatting, then gave each other a hug.\\n   \\n      Landau, chief of the group’s southern command, says he tries to provide emotional support for his men, but the trauma cuts deep and there is only so much he can do to help.\\n   \\n      “I know them more than anyone else. The size of their shoes. I know when they get up in the morning. I know if they have any problems. I know when they need help and when they need to step aside,” he told CNN.\\n   \\n      The aftermath of the attack is so gruesome that only the most experienced ZAKA volunteers are allowed to take part in body collection.\\n   \\n      And even for them, it is often too much.\\n   \\n      “Everybody cries,” said Eli Landau, Yossi’s son and fellow volunteer. He spoke to CNN in Be’eri, one of the kibbutzim communities close\\xa0to the perimeter fence that\\xa0Hamas militants rampaged through. At least 130 of its 1,100 residents were murdered and dozens were kidnapped, according to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF).\\n   \\n      “You can cry and everybody will understand. It’s not stuff that I want to talk about and with these guys, I don’t need to talk. We understand each other,” Eli Landau said.\\n   \\n      On Friday, he and other ZAKA volunteers were combing through homes in Be’eri for the second time, finding more victims and collecting remains left behind during their first visit.\\n   \\n      Jewish tradition requires the body to be buried in its entirety, which means the volunteers painstakingly search sites for even the smallest fragments of the victims’ remains and traces of blood.\\n   \\n      “It’s important to collect the whole body. Even the blood that has left the body. That’s why the work is not done yet. We’re going to go back to each and every community to clean everything, all the blood, so it can be buried,” Elmalih explained.\\n   \\n      It’s a task that is becoming more and more difficult as time goes by. “These volunteers, they are exposed to the most difficult parts of the war. They are getting to the scenes, smelling the smells, seeing the horrific sights,” Elmalih added.\\n   \\n      As ZAKA volunteers worked in Be’eri, several busloads of foreign journalists arrived, escorted by the IDF. Yossi Landau stood in front of them, repeating over and over again what he saw when he first got there, answering questions, occasionally pausing to collect himself. He said he has made it his mission to spread the message.\\n   \\n      Eli, his son, watched from afar, crying. “I don’t know why is he doing what he is doing, talking about this again and again and again. He is going to lose his mind. It’s not healthy for him, it cannot be good for any soul,” he said.\\n   \\n      ZAKA volunteers Yanir Ishay, Yitzhak Ben-Shibrit and his son Aharon spent much of their Sunday working just a few hundred feet from the Gaza border fence, trying to recover the remains of people who were killed there.\\n   \\n      “The military were protecting us, but we came under fire and there was nowhere to hide,” Aharon Ben-Shibrit said, showing CNN a video of the volunteers lying pinned to the floor in as Hamas rockets flew overhead.\\n   \\n      The job is dangerous – physically and mentally.\\n   \\n      “The mental side is worse though,” Ishay said. “When you die, you die, there’s nothing after that. It’s different with your mind,” he said.\\n   \\n      Ishay said he trusts his fellow volunteers completely – not just when they are dealing with a difficult scene, but also when they tell him it’s time to step away. Last week, he took a day off after spending his birthday collecting the dead. It was too much, he said.\\n   \\n      Most ZAKA volunteers say that they haven’t begun to process the trauma, and when they can step away, they don’t want to think.\\n   \\n      “We disconnect ourselves from the world. You come to the field, you start working and nothing else matters. You get home and then start crying,” Yitzhak Ben-Shibrit said.\\n  ',\n",

       "  'contents': ' \\n      A sense of relief washed over a grieving Maine community that endured two days of fear after authorities announced the man accused of killing 18 people at a bowling alley and a restaurant earlier this week was found dead on Friday evening.\\n   \\n      The body of Robert Card, 40, was discovered near a river some 10 miles from the shattered community of Lewiston with an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound, Maine Public Safety Commissioner Michael Sauschuck said at a news conference Friday night.\\n   \\n      The discovery ended a roughly two-day manhunt that left many residents in the serene, picturesque area living on edge and fearful to leave their homes.\\n   \\n      Maine Gov. Janet Mills said she, like others, was relieved that the manhunt and the fear that came attached to it was over.\\n   \\n      “Like many people, I’m breathing a sigh of relief tonight knowing that Robert Card is no longer a threat to anyone,” Mills said at a news conference Friday evening. “I know there are some people – many people – who share that sentiment, but I also know that his death might not bring solace to many.”\\n   \\n      She said the discovery would allow the community to move on and begin “a long and difficult road to healing – but we will heal together.”\\n   \\n      The extensive manhunt started Wednesday night after gunshots rang out at Just-in-Time Recreation and later at Schemengees Bar & Grille in Lewiston, according to officials. The 18 people killed, whom officials identified Friday, ranged in age from 14 to 76. They included a boy who was bowling with his father, contestants in a cornhole tournament for the deaf, and several fathers who leave behind young children. The shooting rampage left 13 others injured, officials said.\\n   \\n      A survivor of the massacre, whose cousin Tricia Asselin was killed in the shooting, was relieved to hear the suspect was found dead so the “community itself can definitely move on without the fear of him out there,” she told CNN’s Kaitlan Collins on Friday night, adding she was “sad because we have so many questions left unanswered.”\\n   \\n      Tammy Asselin, who was separated from her 10-year-old daughter as the shooting began at the bowling alley at Just-in-Time Recreation, continued: “I know it does give my daughter some peace to know that he has been caught, because that was a fear of hers – that he’s still out there.”\\n   \\nHere’s more of the latest in Maine:\\n \\n• Authorities plan to hold a news conference Saturday at 10 a.m. ET to discuss more about the suspect, the discovery of his body and their search efforts.\\n   \\n•\\xa0The gun investigators believe Card used to carry out the massacre was purchased legally in July, just days before he was hospitalized and ordered to undergo a psychiatric evaluation, according to multiple law enforcement sources.\\n   \\n• Card’s body was found near a recycling center from which he had recently been fired, a law enforcement source told CNN.\\n   \\n• All 18 victims in the attack were identified Friday by officials. They range in age from 14 to 76.\\n   \\n      Law enforcement officials say Card, a US Army reservist and certified firearms instructor, had extensive training that included land navigation and firearms. He was described as a skilled marksman and one of the best shooters in his unit by someone who served with him.\\n   \\n      Tammy Asselin, the woman whose cousin Tricia was killed, told CNN Friday she wants to know why the gunman targeted the locations, and why he fired when children were there, among other questions she said might never be answered now.\\n   \\n      “You know, it is just those ‘why’ questions that unfortunately are left unanswered and we will probably never have those answers to.”\\n   \\n      People across the community, state and country have echoed a sense of relief for those in area after days of uncertainty.\\n   \\n      President Joe Biden said he is grateful Maine residents are safe “after spending excruciating days hiding in their homes.”\\n   \\n      Biden, in a statement Friday night after the suspect was found dead, said his administration will continue “to provide everything that is needed to support the people of Maine.” He also reiterated his call to Congress to address gun violence.\\n   \\n      “Americans should not have to live like this,” Biden said. “I once again call on\\xa0Republicans in Congress\\xa0to fulfill their obligation to keep the American people safe. Until that day comes, I will continue to do everything in my power to end this gun violence epidemic. The Lewiston community – and all Americans – deserve nothing less.”\\n   \\n      Even before the discovery of Card’s body, the Lewiston community showcased its strength Friday. People trickled onto the streets of downtown Lewiston, covered in fall leaves, amid the lingering sense of uncertainty over Card’s whereabouts and alarming messages from authorities to be vigilant.\\n   \\n      A steady stream of people walked the sidewalks, and entered and exited buildings. Several drivers traveled through the area even before the shelter-in-place order, which authorities enacted early in the manhunt, was lifted early Friday evening, just hours before authorities said Card’s body had been found.\\n   \\n      Someone decorated trees with supportive paper-hearted messages like “to my community” and “to my neighbors” on trees in downtown Lewiston.\\n   \\n      Several businesses remained closed throughout the afternoon, but some owners, like the Halal markets serving the area’s immigrant community, said they opened their doors for a shortened period Friday due to safety concerns.\\n   \\n      An emotional Deborah Roy, still grieving from the loss of her 92-year-old mother a few weeks ago, tried to hold back tears as she told CNN she’d been at home for three days before visiting a grocery store earlier Friday in Lisbon, a town 15 minutes away from Lewiston.\\n   \\n      “I just wanted to go for a ride to get away,” Roy said. A line of customers stretched to the back of the store that afternoon as several other businesses remained closed during the shelter-in-place order.\\n   \\n      Roy said she saw “people, cars everywhere, (and) cameras” while en route to the store.\\n   \\n      “When I came down over that bridge and I saw all the officers, it hit home,” Roy said tearfully.\\n   \\n\\ufeff“I’m just blown away to see this happening in our own little town,” she said. “How one person can tip the world upside down, it’s devastating.”\\n   \\n      Just over 48 hours after the manhunt began, authorities found Card’s body at 7:45 p.m. Friday near the Androscoggin River in the Lisbon Falls area, some 10 miles from Lewiston, said Sauschuck, the state public safety commissioner.\\n   \\n      Card’s body was found near a recycling center from which he had recently been fired, a law enforcement source told CNN. Earlier this week, authorities had found Card’s vehicle abandoned after the shooting near a boat launch in the Lisbon area.\\n   \\n      The body was in a wooded area, multiple sources told CNN.\\n   \\n      Details about when Card died “remains to be seen,” Sauschuck said Friday, and authorities haven’t announced a motive in the shooting.\\n   \\n      While no motive has been announced, a key theory about why the bowling alley and the restaurant were targeted emerged during the investigation, law enforcement sources told CNN Thursday. Card recently broke up with a longtime girlfriend, and investigators are pursuing the theory Card went to the bowling alley and the bar because they were places the couple used to frequent, law enforcement sources told CNN’s John Miller.\\n   \\n      Before Card’s death was announced, authorities found a note from Card that indicated that he did not expect to be alive when the note was found, a law enforcement official told CNN on Friday.\\n   \\n      The note’s discovery prompted the manhunt’s shift to include a water search in the Androscoggin River near where investigators found Card’s abandoned vehicle in Lisbon. But after an extensive search that included divers, underwater vessels and aircraft – Card was still not found.\\n   \\n      Over two days, law enforcement officers with long guns surrounded and searched various areas across the typically quiet area, from a greenhouse at Springworks Farm in Lisbon to homes and places connected to the suspect.\\n   \\n      Law enforcement officers twice visited Card’s home on Thursday, surrounding the home that night ordering any occupants to come out, though it was unclear whether anyone was inside.\\n   \\n      Investigators had earlier executed a search warrant Thursday at the home, looking for computers, notes, weapons and any evidence that might indicate a plan for the shootings, law enforcement sources told CNN.\\n   \\n      A law enforcement official said Friday that investigators have also recovered a cell phone that belonged to the suspect.\\n   \\n      Investigators said they believe the gun Card used in the massacre was legally bought  just days before he was hospitalized and ordered into undergoing a psychiatric evaluation in mid-July, according to multiple law enforcement sources.\\n   \\n      Card, who first enlisted in the Army Reserve in 2002, was reported by Army Reserve officials for “behaving erratically,” prompting New York State Police to respond to the Camp Smith military base where Card served in Cortlandt, New York.\\n   \\n      Card was reportedly acting “belligerently and possibly intoxicated,” according to a source briefed on the matter, and state police transported him to a nearby hospital for suspected intoxication. He was released the next day, authorities said.\\n   \\n      When asked for information about the encounter, a New York State Police spokesperson told CNN: “This is an active investigation, and the New York State Police does not comment on active investigations.”\\n   \\n      The Army gave Card a “Command Referral” to seek treatment after a federal law enforcement source told Army personnel that Card had been “hearing voices” and had thoughts about “hurting other soldiers,” the source told CNN.\\n   \\n      The encounters happened 10 days after Card purchased the high-powered rifle at a Maine gun store, law enforcement sources said. The powerful rifle was a Ruger SFAR chambered for high-powered 308 ammunition, according to the sources.\\n   \\n      Sources also say the weapon found inside Card’s vehicle appears to be the same fired by the gunman at the bowling alley and a bar, though a ballistics match has not been confirmed.\\n   \\n      The weapon will be processed by the FBI and ATF for fingerprints and DNA and then run through laboratory testing to determine if the bullets and shell casings found at the scene match.\\n   \\n      Along with the rifle, sources say Card also bought a Beretta 92-F 9mm semi-automatic pistol in July. It is the standard pistol of the US military.\\n   \\n      Shortly before 7 p.m. on Wednesday, Card began shooting at a Lewiston bowling alley, and later at a bar in the largely working-class community, authorities say.\\n   \\n      Officers responded to the shooting locations in Lewiston within minutes of 911 calls, police said.\\n   \\n      The initial 911 call from Just-In-Time Recreation came in at 6:56 p.m., and the first Lewiston police officer arrived at 7 p.m., Sauschuck said Friday.\\n   \\n      People ran from the bowling alley as police cruisers responded to the scene, video obtained by CNN showed.\\n   \\n      About 12 minutes after the first calls, authorities received multiple 911 calls about a shooter at Schemengees Bar and Grille Restaurant, roughly 4 miles from the bowling alley.\\n   \\n      The shooting and subsequent manhunt for Card prompted shelter-in-place orders for Androscoggin and northern Sagadahoc counties, where Lewiston, Auburn and Lisbon are located.\\n   \\n      Investigators executed a search warrant on Thursday at Card’s home, looking for computers, notes, weapons and any evidence that might indicate a plan for the shootings, law enforcement sources told CNN.\\n   \\n      Authorities say they found the suspect’s car abandoned about 8 miles from Lewiston in Lisbon.\\n   \\n      The 18 victims from the shooting rampage were identified Friday – with victims ranging in age from 14 to 76.\\n   \\n      Father and son Bill and Aaron Young were enjoying a night of bowling when the shooting occurred. They were both killed.\\n   \\n      Aaron, 14, was an honor student who took pride in his grades, Aaron’s sister and Bill’s stepdaughter, Kayla Putnam, told CNN affiliate WCVB.\\n   \\n      Bill was an auto mechanic, Putnam said, and the rock of the family.\\n   \\n      “It’s going to be very hard for the family right now to deal without him because he was kind of the center of the family and everything,”\\xa0 Putnam told WCVB.\\n   \\n      Bob Violette, 76, was days away from turning 77 when he was shot and killed at the bowling alley, according to CNN affiliate \\ufeffWBZ.\\n   \\n      Violette’s relatives say he was teaching a youth bowling league when gunfire erupted, and they believe he died protecting his students, WBZ reported. His wife, Lucille, also died in the attack.\\n   \\n      “Bob’s helped with the youth league for as long as I can remember,” Violette’s friend Brandon Dubuc told WBZ. “If he was there with those kids, he was protecting those kids.

       "  'contents': ' \\n      For the victims of the mass shooting Wednesday night in Lewiston, Maine, it was an ordinary night out.\\n   \\n      Some were participating in a cornhole tournament while others were enjoying a meal.  Then a shooter ended their fun.\\n   \\n      And now another American community is grieving as the identities of those friends and loved ones whose lives were lost emerge.\\n   \\n      The suspect in the shooting rampage that left 18 people dead and 13 others wounded at a restaurant and bowling alley was found dead Friday evening after a two-day manhunt, authorities said. Robert Card was found dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound along a river in nearby Lisbon Falls, according to state Public Safety Commissioner Michael Sauschuck.\\n   \\n      All the victims were identified Friday by officials. The oldest killed in the shootings was a 76-year-old man and the youngest was a 14-year-old boy bowling with his father.\\n   \\n      It is the deadliest mass shooting in the United States this year, and the worst since a gunman killed 19 students and two teachers at a school in Uvalde, Texas, last year. Overall, at least 566 mass shootings have happened this year across the country, with four or more shot excluding the shooter, according to the\\xa0Gun Violence Archive.\\n   \\n      Here’s what we know so far about the victims:\\n   \\n      Tricia\\xa0Asselin, 53, was the heart of her tight-knit family and worked as a part-time employee at the bowling alley, Just-in-Time Recreation, her siblings told CNN.Even on her night off on Wednesday, Asselin was at Just-in-Time, her brother told CNN.“What I’m told is that when it all started happening, she ran up to the counter and started to call 911, and that’s when she was shot,” DJ Johnson told CNN. “That was just her. She wasn’t going to run.

Renfroe said in a\\xa0statement.\\xa0“He had much more life to live before it was stolen from him in an all-too-common senseless act of gun violence.”\\n   \\n      In a statement about the tragedy, the Governor Baxter School for the Deaf noted Vozzella’s death and said the attack took the lives of several in their community. \\n   \\n      “We lost four of our cherished community members in last night’s Lewiston shootings. Including two fathers of children in our programs,” the\\xa0school’s executive director, Karen Hopkins,\\xa0said in a Facebook post. “Some of our staff were very close to these members of our community.”\\n   \\n      Vozzella, who was an active cornhole player, also participated in several tournaments in the region organized by the New England Deaf Cornhole league.\\n   \\n      “With sadly and heavy hearts, NEDC has lost a member of our community, Steve Vozzella. He was one the victims lost in the shooting in Maine,” the organization wrote in a\\xa0Facebook post Thursday. It noted he’d brought “excitement” and a “huge smile” to competitions. “He will be missed on and off the courts!”\\n   \\n      The New England Deaf Cornhole league plans to hold a moment of silence in Vozzella’s honor during an upcoming tournament in November, the group said in their post.\\n   \\n      Peyton Brewer-Ross, 39, was participating in a cornhole tournament at Schemengees Bar & Grille Restaurant when he was killed, his brother Ralph Brewer told CNN.\\xa0Brewer-Ross loved playing cornhole and enjoying hanging out with friends at Schemengees.\\n   \\n      Brewer-Ross “loved being a dad more than anything else,” his brother said.

It just leaves you an empty hole that I don’t know how it will ever be filled.”\\n   \\n      He said he has no hatred for the killer.\\n   \\n      “You have to put that out of your mind,” he said. “You have to let the Lord do whatever needs to be done.

       " {'headline': '\\n      Mike Johnson is well within the mainstream of today’s GOP\\n    ',\n",
       "  'contents': ' \\n      Republicans’ long public nightmare came to an end this past week when Louisiana’s Mike Johnson became the 56th speaker of the House. If you’re like most people who claim to be smart about politics, you immediately pretended to know who he was and then went to Google him.\\n   \\n      This has led to a bit of a debate about Johnson’s ideological record. Just how conservative is he? A look at the data reveals that Johnson is most certainly well to the right of the median American voter. But he is actually fairly close to the center of a Republican Party that has shifted further right in recent years.\\n   \\n      Consider what most people have learned about Johnson: He is an ardent defender of former President Donald Trump and was a key figure in the efforts to overturn the 2020 election.\\n   \\nJoe Biden, of course, was the legitimate winner of that election, and there is no real proof that he wasn’t. Most general election voters agree that Biden won the election legitimately. A recent ABC News/Washington Post poll found that just 29% of registered voters feel he didn’t.\\n   \\n      Among Republicans, however, 60% of them said Biden’s win wasn’t legitimate, according to that same poll. Only 23% disagreed.\\n   \\n      Meanwhile, the overwhelming majority of Republicans (70%) in a recent CNN/SSRS survey indicated that the criminal charges Trump faces over his failed attempts to overturn the 2020 election are not relevant to his fitness to serve another term. Even among the general electorate, just 49% said it should be disqualifying.\\n   \\n      Indeed, we can’t forget that a clear majority of House Republicans (139 of them, including Johnson) voted against certifying 2020 election results from at least one state. Their votes were outside the mainstream among all House members but not within the House Republican Conference.\\n   \\n      The same is true for an amicus brief that Johnson led supporting an effort to get the Supreme Court to overturn the 2020 election results in four Biden-won states. Most House members didn’t sign. A majority of House Republican members (126) did.\\n   \\n      The fact is, whether you like it or not, arguing that Biden was the rightful winner of the 2020 election is the minority point of view among Republicans today.\\n   \\n      Johnson has also faced criticism for his position on abortion. He co-sponsored a bill to prohibit abortions once a fetal heartbeat is detected, usually around six weeks.\\n   \\n      A May Gallup poll found that 59% of Americans were opposed to such legislation, with 37% in favor. This lines up with the pro-abortion rights side winning every abortion-related ballot measure since Roe v. Wade was overturned last year, including in several red states.\\n   \\n      But take a look at what that same poll found among Republicans: A majority (61%) wanted abortion banned after six weeks. Johnson, again, is within the mainstream of his party.\\n   \\n      Legislatively, most Southern states have enacted bans on abortion at six weeks or even earlier.\\n   \\n      I could go on and on about Johnson’s record on different issues that many object to, and we’ll find fairly consistently that while he may not be with the median general election voter, he is with the median Republican voter.\\n   \\n      This is best seen through aggregate statistics compiled by the academics at Voteview. Since entering the House in 2017, Johnson has built a voting record that is more conservative than 81% of all members currently serving. He is, however, only more conservative than 63% of his GOP colleagues. In other words, 37% of House Republicans are more conservative than the new speaker. That puts Johnson right in the middle third of today’s House Republican Conference.\\n   \\n      In fact, Johnson has voted with the Republican majority 94% of the time this Congress. That almost matches the median House Republican member (93%).\\n   \\n      To put that in perspective, take a look at failed speaker hopeful Jim Jordan. The Ohio congressman’s voting record is more conservative than 91% of other House Republicans. Unlike Johnson, Jordan really is out of the mainstream not just within Congress overall but the House Republican Conference, as well.\\n   \\n      This isn’t to say that Johnson isn’t more conservative than the Republicans of yesteryear. It’s just that Republicans, as a whole, have become more conservative.\\n   \\n      For example, Kentucky Rep. Hal Rogers, who was first elected in 1980 and is the longest-serving House Republican incumbent, was more conservative than 59% of GOP members during his first term. He’s more moderate than over 80% of House Republicans today.\\n   \\n      And Republican members of Congress remain representative of their voters. According to a 1982 CBS News poll, less than 50% of adults who self-identified as Republican called themselves conservative. This past year, Gallup has found that over 70% of Republicans\\xa0say they are conservative.\\n   \\n      Of course, polls also show that Democrats have become considerably more liberal over the same stretch. As a result, independents, who are about as likely to identify as moderate as they were 40 years ago, probably feel like neither party represents them.\\n   \\n      But there are no independents in the House. There are Democrats and Republicans. And it’s in this political universe where someone like Johnson could have attained the House speakership. He’s simply emblematic of today’s GOP.\\n  ',\n",

       "  'contents': ' \\nEditor’s Note: Editor’s note: If you or someone you know is struggling with suicidal thoughts or mental health matters, please call the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline by dialing 988 to connect with a trained counselor, or visit the 988 Lifeline website.\\n \\n      When fighting broke out in Kang Hyeon-joo’s elementary school classroom, her heart would beat so fast she could not breathe and her vision would blur.\\n   \\n      “They were throwing punches and kicking faces, throwing chairs and tables around,” she recalled, adding she had been hurt trying to intervene.\\n   \\n      For two years, Kang struggled to discipline her students – or cope with the parental backlash when she did. She claims her principal did nothing to help and would tell her simply to “just take a week off”.\\n   \\n      The strain took a dangerous toll. Kang says she started feeling the urge to jump in front of a bus. “If I just jumped at least, I would feel some relief. If I just jumped off a tall building, that would at least give me some peace.” \\n   \\n      Kang is currently on sick leave but is far from alone in her experiences.\\n   \\n      Tens of thousands of teachers have been protesting in recent months, calling for more protection from students and parents. At one protest in Seoul last month, 200,000 gathered, according to organizers, forcing the government to take notice and action.\\n   \\n      The unified stand by the country’s teaching staff comes after the suicide of a first-grade teacher, in her early 20s, in July. She was found dead in her classroom in Seoul. Police have mentioned a problematic student and parental pressure while discussing her case, but have not given a definitive reason for her suicide.\\n   \\n      Several more teachers have taken their own lives since July and some of these cases have reportedly been linked to school stress, according to colleagues of the deceased and bereaved families.  \\n   \\n      Government data shows 100 public school teachers killed themselves from January 2018 to June 2023, 11 of them in the first six months of this year, but does not specify what factors contributed to their deaths.\\n   \\n      Sung Youl-kwan, a professor of education at Kyung Hee University, says the speed and size of the protests took many by surprise. “I think there has been like a shared feeling that this can happen to me too,” he said.\\n   \\n      Teachers point to a 2014 child abuse law, intended to protect children, as one of the main reasons they feel unable to discipline students. They say they are fearful of being sued by a small percentage of parents for causing emotional distress to their child and being dragged through the courts.\\n   \\n      “School is the last barrier to let students know what is okay in society and what is not. But we couldn’t do anything, if we teach them, we could be accused,” said Ahn Ji-hye, an elementary school teacher who helped organize previous protests.\\n   \\n      Ahn says parents have called her mobile phone some days from 6 a.m. until 11 p.m., wanting to talk about their child or complain.\\n   \\n      South Korea’s education minister Lee Ju-ho initially warned teachers that a mass strike would be an illegal act. That position was swiftly reversed, and a set of legal revisions passed the National Assembly on September 21, a fast piece of legislation.\\n   \\n      One of the key changes is providing teachers some protection from being sued for child abuse if their discipline is considered a legitimate educational activity. Also, the responsibility for handling school complaints and lawsuits brought by parents now rests with the principal. \\n   \\n      “So far we have a culture where the school principal tended to pass those responsibilities to teachers,” said Professor Sung.\\n   \\n      The new law will also protect teachers’ personal information, such as their mobile phone numbers, and require parents to contact the school with concerns or complaints rather than the teacher directly.\\n   \\n      In the past, Ahn said, “If I could not give my personal phone number to them, sometimes some parents would come to the parking lot and watch and see and take a note of my phone number from my car, then they would text message me.” It is customary for Koreans to display their phone number in the bottom corner of their windscreen.\\n   \\n      Ahn welcomes the legal changes as “meaningful,” but insists higher-level laws like the Child Welfare Act and Child Abuse Punishment Act also need to be revised. “It is still possible to report teachers based on suspicion alone according to these laws,” she said.\\n   \\n      She says that, for now at least, the protests will continue. \\n   \\n      One is planned for outside the National Assembly on October 28. Ahn says she would like to see penalties for parents who make unfounded accusations against teachers or practical measures put in place so that mandated changes can be adopted in classrooms, such as removing a disruptive student elsewhere to allow teaching to continue.\\n   \\n      Professor Sung believes the revisions will help in the short term, but cautions that the law should be seen as a safety net not a solution.\\n   \\n      Critics say South Korean society places a disproportionate level of importance on academic success so it should not be surprising that parents put teachers – and the wider education system – under so much pressure.\\n   \\n      It is the norm for students to attend a cram school, called hagwon, after their regular school hours, not as an extra but as a basic and expensive requirement to succeed. \\n   \\n      On the day of the national college entrance exam, known as Suneung in Korean, airplanes are grounded, and commuting hours are adjusted to ensure that students taking the exams are not disturbed.\\n   \\n      “We have a culture in which parents have usually one child and they are ready to pour every financial resource and opportunity into this child,” Sung said. \\n   \\n      “This pressure or obsession with education, sometimes with a high score, high achievement (mindset), is not a good environment for teachers (because) they are taking the pressure from the parents.”\\n   \\n      Sung says the days of a teacher being automatically respected are long gone, not just in South Korea but elsewhere in the world, and the teacher-parent dynamic is unrecognizable from just a decade or two ago.    \\n   \\n      “In educational policies, parents are regarded as like a consumer, with consumer sovereignty, and school and teachers are regarded as service providers”, he said, adding parents believe they “have the right to demand many things from schools.”\\n   \\n      In a country where education is considered central to success, teacher satisfaction is low. A survey by the Federation of Teachers’ Labor Union in April found 26.5% of teachers polled said they had received counseling or treatment for psychological issues due to their job. Some 87% said they have considered moving job or quitting in the past year.\\n  ',\n",

       " {'headline': '\\n      Key takeaways from Sam Bankman-Fried’s first days on the witness stand\\n    ',\n",
       "  'contents': ' \\n      Former crypto billionaire Sam Bankman-Fried took the stand in front of a judge and jury last week in his criminal fraud trial. If convicted on all seven fraud counts he faces, the 31-year-old could spend the rest of his life in prison.\\n   \\n      Prosecutors claim that Bankman-Fried’s crypto exchange, FTX, “was built on lies,” and that he took money from customers to enrich himself and his family, buy luxury beachfront property in the Bahamas and funnel millions into US political campaigns.\\n   \\n      Bankman-Fried’s lawyers argue that their client, like many entrepreneurs, was “building the plane as they were flying it” and that “it’s not a crime to be the CEO of a company that later files for bankruptcy.”\\n   \\n      After a full day on the witness stand Friday, the disgraced former CEO is expected to return for another day of testimony on Monday.\\n   \\n      Here’s what we’ve learned so far.\\n   \\n      Sam Bankman-Fried’s casual wardrobe and wild curly hair were a subject of discussion in court on Friday.\\n   \\n      Caroline Ellison, Bankman-Fried’s ex-girlfriend and the former CEO of sister company Alameda Research, testified earlier this month that Bankman-Fried’s style was part of a marketing strategy to look like an eccentric\\xa0startup founder. Bankman-Fried’s lead attorney Mark Cohen sought to undermine that.\\n   \\n      “Why did you\\xa0wear the shorts\\xa0and T-shirts?” Cohen asked.\\n   \\n      “I found them comfortable,” Bankman-Fried replied.\\n   \\n      Cohen also asked about the famous mop of unruly dark hair.\\n \\n      “I was kind of busy and lazy and didn’t bother getting a haircut for long periods of time,” Bankman-Fried said.\\n   \\n      Overall, Bankman-Fried said he never intended to be the public face of FTX. It was “an accident” at first, he told the court.\\n   \\n      “I hadn’t intended to be a public face of anything,” he said, adding that he is “somewhat introverted.”\\n   \\n      Bankman-Fried’s testimony has so far underscored his view that other executives at FTX and Alameda often acted independently, without direct oversight from Bankman-Fried, who was the CEO of both companies for a time.\\n   \\n      “Ultimately, I had authority,” he said. “On the other hand, I wasn’t much of a programmer,” and didn’t directly supervise the work of developers who were building FTX’s code.\\n   \\n      Bankman-Fried is essentially saying that he wasn’t aware of the so-called back door that Alameda used to withdraw FTX customer funds — a key issue in the case.\\n   \\n      “I wasn’t entirely sure what was happening,” Bankman-Fried said.\\n   \\n      Prosecutors allege that Bankman-Fried\\xa0built a “back door” into FTX’s accounting system,\\xa0allowing him to alter the company’s financial records without tripping accounting red flags. Bankman-Fried is being accused of using this “back door” to transfer billions of dollars in FTX customer funds to Alameda.\\n   \\n      When Bankman-Fried and Gary Wang started FTX in 2019, there were already dozens of crypto exchanges. However, Bankman-Fried said Friday he felt their “design philosophies” were “clunky” and “didn’t make a lot of sense.”\\n   \\n      “If you wanted to trade, there were hundreds of wallets you had to manage for a single account,” he said. The goal of FTX was to set up an exchange that was more seamless and approachable for traders.\\n   \\n      He said he initially envisioned quickly selling FTX to cryptocurrency exchange Binance, since he “had no idea how we would get customers.”\\n   \\n      However, Binance ended up using an internal team to build out its own exchange platform. And the more he thought about it, Bankman-Fried said, the more he\\xa0became convinced that he could grow FTX despite the challenge of attracting customers.\\n   \\n      It began to feel “less hopeless, like maybe we could figure it out,” SBF said.\\n   \\n      “I thought there was maybe a 20% chance of success,” and an 80% chance it would shut down after a few months, he told jurors. “Even that 20% chance was a huge opportunity, given that the biggest exchanges at the time were multibillion-dollar companies.”\\n   \\n      When shopping for an arena with which FTX could launch a brand partnership, Bankman-Fried testified Friday that his company had talks with a few different sports venues.\\n   \\n      Eventually, they settled on the home of the Miami Heat, in what was\\xa0reported to be a\\xa0$135 million, 19-year deal, renaming the American Airlines Arena as FTX Arena.\\n   \\n      Venues that didn’t work out at the time included football stadiums for the New Orleans Saints and the Kansas City Chiefs, as well as the Kansas City Royals’ baseball stadium.\\n   \\n      “No offense to the Kansas City Royals, but we didn’t want to be known as the Kansas City Royals of crypto exchanges,” SBF said Friday afternoon.\\n   \\n      The FTX Arena was later renamed the Kaseya Center, following the company’s collapse last fall.\\n   \\n      Judge Lewis Kaplan expressed exasperation with some of Bankman-Fried’s meandering answers, noting at one point: “The witness has what I’ll simply call an interesting way of responding to questions.”\\n   \\n      When questioned by his own attorneys, Bankman-Fried appeared confident and upbeat. But he grew increasingly agitated when grilled by prosecutors.\\n   \\n      Under cross-examination on Thursday, he frequently gave vague\\xa0answers in which he said he was “not entirely sure” or didn’t recall past conversations about company policies and meetings with lawyers.\\n   \\n      At one point, Kaplan interjected, urging Bankman-Fried to\\xa0“listen to the question, and answer the question directly.”\\n   \\n      In response to questions from Assistant US Attorney Danielle Sassoon, Bankman-Fried said, variously: “I am giving you my best guess at answering the question,” “I am going to answer what I think the question you are asking is, but I apologize if I’m answering the wrong question” and “I wouldn’t phrase it that way. But I think that the answer to the question I understand you to be trying to ask is ‘yes.’”\\n   \\n      When asked if he could “point\\xa0out to us where in this agreement you think Alameda is permitted to spend FTX customer funds,” Bankman-Fried replied:\\n   \\n      “So I should preface this by saying I’m not a lawyer. I’m not giving a legal interpretation of this. I’m just giving, as best I can, what my memory is. And the parts of this that jibe with that, I, you know — I’m not trying to give a definitive legal ruling on what this does or doesn’t say. I’m not sure that I would quite answer yes to the question as you most recently phrased it. I’m going to try as best I can to give the answer that I believe, which is that, at least as I remember understanding it at the time, FTX either itself or I think as actually happened, without FTX as an intermediary, customers’ fiat funds would be sent to Alameda bank accounts, FTX would retain, effectively, a debt from Alameda for those and a lien on Alameda’s assets as security for that ongoing liability, that it would be repayable on direction from FTX in the return section here, and in the payment directive section; and that the provider could hold or transfer the funds as laid out in the FTX assets section unless or until directed to return them to FTX.”\\n  ',\n",

       "  'contents': ' \\n  Editor’s Note: A version of this story appears in CNN’s Meanwhile in the Middle East newsletter, a three-times-a-week look inside the region’s biggest stories.\\xa0Sign up here.\\n \\n      A day after Palestinian militant group Hamas launched its brutal attack on Israel, a curious video emerged out of Tehran’s Azadi stadium. Hundreds of soccer fans, gathered to watch a match between Perspolis FC and Gol Gohar Sirjan FC, chanted in unison: “Shove the Palestinian flag up your a**.”\\n   \\n      The vulgar protest came in response to officials attempting to raise a Palestinian flag in the stadium to show support for the October 7 attack. But for the fans, it was another unwelcome mixing of politics and soccer, and a stark reminder of the Iranian government’s involvement in proxy battles in far-flung arenas.\\n   \\n      Hamas’ attack, which killed 1,400 people according to Israeli authorities, prompted a fierce aerial campaign on Gaza that has so far killed more than 7,000 people, according to the health ministry in Hamas-controlled Gaza. And there are now concerns that more fronts will open in the war, including one with Iran.\\n   \\n      Experts say that while Iran is wary of being dragged into the Israel-Hamas war, it may not be in full control if the militias it backs in the region independently intervene as Hamas suffers heavy blows and the death toll in Gaza continues to mount.\\n   \\n      “What connects all these groups to Iran is their anti-Israel policies,” said Sima Shine, head of the Iran program at the Institute for National Security Studies (INSS) in Tel Aviv, noting that while Iran has varying levels of influence over the groups, it doesn’t dictate all their actions.\\n   \\n      In the early days after the October 7 attack, questions were raised about Iran’s potential involvement in the killings. Tehran at the time commended the operation but was quick to deny any hand in it . Initial US intelligence also suggested that Iranian officials were surprised by Hamas’ attack, and that Tehran was not directly involved in its planning, resourcing or approval, CNN has reported.\\n \\n      Despite its denial, however, Iran has ramped up its rhetoric against its arch enemy.\\n   \\n      Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian has warned that Israel’s bombardment of Gaza could have far-reaching consequences, saying that if Israel does not halt its airstrikes, “it is highly probable that many other fronts will be opened.”\\n   \\n      “This option is not ruled out and this is becoming increasingly more probable,” he told Al Jazeera last week.\\n   \\n      On Monday Abdollahian said the US has sent Iran two messages regarding escalation in the region.\\n   \\n      “The first message said that the United States is not interested in expanding the war, and the second message asked Iran to have self-restraint and insisted that Iran should also ask other countries and other sides to have self-restraint,” Abdollahian said during a news conference in Tehran Monday, without saying how and when the messages were delivered.\\n   \\n      He added that while the US says it wants to de-escalate, it has contradicted itself by continuing to support Israel.\\n   \\n      Trita Parsi, vice-president of the Quincy Institute in Washington, DC, said there is no appetite or desire from either Iran, the US or Israel for a wider war, but that Washington’s failure to restrain Israel may inadvertently drive the region towards escalation.\\n   \\n      US President Joe Biden last week pledged continued support for Israel, which has hardened Arab sentiment across the region and translated to mass protests against Israeli and American policies.\\n   \\n      “The only actor that has a clear interest in (a wider conflict) is Hamas, given that an enlargement of the war could change the dynamics in a favorable way for them,” Parsi said. In the absence of US efforts to rein in Israel, “many (regional) actors are going to feel compelled to step in… because of their own strategic calculations.”\\n   \\n      “When Israel is mobilizing 300,000 (troops), it is not likely that Hezbollah is going to sit there and assume that this is done only to go after Hamas,” he said, adding that it will factor in the risk of Israel going after the Lebanese group as well.\\n   \\n      An Iran-backed armed group and powerful regional force, Hezbollah has been trading fire with Israel’s military since the October 7 attack by Hamas. The fighting has been the worst since the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war, but it has so far been restricted to the border between Lebanon and Israel.\\n   \\n      Israel’s defense minister last week said that Israel was not interested in another war with Hezbollah. Israel has nonetheless turned the area of 4-kilometer radius near its border into a closed military zone, and evacuated residents from 28 communities within 2 kilometers of the Lebanese border.\\n   \\n      Hezbollah’s influence spans beyond Lebanon, however. It also operates alongside Iran’s elite Revolutionary Guard Corps in Syria, where the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights separates Israel from Tehran-aligned fighters.\\n   \\n      The Lebanese group also has its own channels with Hamas. Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah met Wednesday with top officials from Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, it said in a statement, without revealing where the meeting took place.\\n   \\n      “An assessment was made of…what the parties of the resistance axis must do at this sensitive stage to achieve a real victory for the resistance in Gaza and Palestine and to stop the treacherous and brutal aggression against our people,” it said.\\n   \\n      The Hamas-Israel conflict has also led to skirmishes in Syria and Iraq, from which Iran-backed militias have launched multiple drone attacks on US forces. And the US now has specific intelligence that those same groups could escalate even further as the war between Israel and Hamas continues, CNN reported this week.\\n \\n      The US continues to warn Tehran against taking advantage of the current situation or encouraging its proxies to escalate. On Tuesday, Secretary of State Antony Blinken urged the United Nations Security Council to warn Iran against any further involvement.\\n   \\n      “Tell Iran, tell its proxies in public, in private, through every means: Do not open another front against Israel in this conflict. Do not attack Israel’s partners,” Blinken said, noting that a “broader conflict would be devastating, not only for Palestinians and Israelis, but for people across the region, and indeed, around the world.”\\n   \\n      The US on Thursday carried out airstrikes targeting two facilities linked to Iranian-backed militias in eastern Syria, according to a statement from Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin. The strikes\\xa0came after a series of drone and rocket attacks against US forces in the region. The statement said the targeted facilities have been used by Iran’s IRGC and affiliated groups.\\n   \\n      Shine, of the INSS, said that Iran does not want a direct war with Israel because that would mean a direct war with the US. “It is very obvious that Iran does not want to be directly involved, and would prefer that (only) the proxies are involved.”\\n   \\n      But that may not play out exactly how Iran wants, added Shine, who previously served in the Israeli intelligence community for most of her career.\\n   \\n      “Iran has to take into account that the world is not operating according to what Iran decides or wants,” she told CNN. “So, if they decide to use their proxies too much, they might find themselves in a war they don’t want.”\\n   \\n      Parsi of the Quincy Institute said that the Iranian government is nonetheless preparing its population for war.\\n   \\n      Iranian media has been brimming with news of the Gaza war, with officials across Iran’s political spectrum expressing solidarity with Palestinians.\\n   \\n      “They’re already preparing the public opinion for this eventuality by essentially trying to make the argument that this is something that is brought to their doorstep because of what the Israelis are doing and because of the American support for it,” Parsi said.\\n   \\n      This shows there are already concerns in the Iranian government about how citizens will react to a war in which Iran is directly involved, he added.\\n   \\n      Even if there is a widener war that is still “below the threshold of a direct US-Iran engagement” – where it is restricted to Iranian proxies fighting Israel – it would still be an extremely unstable situation, he said. “No one can even control the current situation and make sure it doesn’t escalate.”\\n   \\nGo deeper into the biggest stories and trends in the Middle East and what they mean for your world.

       "  'contents': ' \\nSouth Africa and New Zealand will meet on Saturday in a Rugby World Cup final for the first time since 1995.\\n   \\n      On that occasion, it was tournament host South Africa which won a close-fought contest 15-12 to lift the Webb Ellis Cup for the first time.\\n   \\n      After the end of the apartheid era, this was a victory that saw South African President Nelson Mandela present the trophy to Springboks captain Francois Pienaar. Mandela dressed in a replica of Pienaar’s No. 6 shirt is one of the most iconic images in sporting history – a powerful, symbolic moment as a nation attempted to reconcile with its divisive past.\\n   \\n      Twenty-four years on from that enduring moment, it was the inspiring Siya Kolisi who led his country to victory in the 2019 final against England, becoming the first Black captain to lead South Africa to World Cup glory.\\n   \\n      Born amid desperate poverty in the township of Zwide, just outside Port Elizabeth, Kolisi is the embodiment of the impossible dream to so many in his homeland and beyond.\\n   \\n      Indeed, his participation in this year’s World Cup is also nothing short of remarkable. In April, he suffered a serious knee injury and underwent surgery before battling back to fitness.\\n   \\n      A devout Christian, Kolisi later acknowledged the importance his strong faith played in his recovery. He now has the chance to join All Blacks great Richie McCaw as the only captain to win consecutive tournaments.\\n   \\n      “I don’t think that it’s stuff that you can dream about because it doesn’t happen often,” said the 32-year-old, per Reuters, ahead of a game in which both countries are seeking to win the coveted title for a record fourth time.\\n   \\n      “I don’t think it will happen in our lifetime again, two teams like this. It will probably be the biggest game of my life,” added Kolisi.\\n   \\n      The Springboks superstar knows his team is carrying the hopes of a nation. “People send us videos and tell us this is sometimes the only time they are happy about something. It’s when we play,” the flanker reflected.\\n   \\n      “When we play or when you then get selected, you know it’s for something far bigger than yourself.”\\n   \\n      Lining up alongside Kolisi on Saturday will be Bongi Mbonambi after World Rugby opted to not charge the Springboks hooker for alleged use of discriminatory language against England’s Tom Curry in the semifinal due to “insufficient evidence.”\\n   \\n      Kolisi revealed he’d reached out to Curry following the abuse and threats the Englishman and his family have received online.\\n   \\n      “I have been through it too. We can take it as players. When it comes to us directly, it’s fine, but when it comes to your family, it’s totally different,” the South African captain said. “It’s the one part of the game that we really don’t enjoy.”\\n   \\n      While New Zealand has won the last three times these two countries have faced each other at a Rugby World Cup, the Kiwis will remember all too well what happened when they met in August, as the now top-ranked South Africa inflicted a record 35-7 defeat on the All Blacks at Twickenham Stadium in London.\\n   \\n      Unwisely written off by some after losing its tournament opener to France, New Zealand is looking to be crowned world champion for the first time since 2015.\\n   \\n      There’s disappointment though for the most-capped All Black of them all, Sam Whitelock, who drops to the bench in his final game for New Zealand.\\n   \\n      Whitelock is one of several Kiwi stars calling time on their international careers after the tournament, but the 35-year-old knows he has the chance to become the sport’s first three-time champion.\\n   \\n      This will also be the last match as head coach for Ian Foster in what has become an unlikely title chance for New Zealand.\\n   \\n      During Foster’s tenure, the All Blacks have suffered 11 defeats and two draws over the last four years, though the 58-year-old coach has guided the nation to four Rugby Championships triumphs.\\n   \\n      “So we’ve woken up this week and we’re in a World Cup final and we’re excited and, right now, we’re trying to make sure we balance the control of the emotion of it versus dealing with all the messages from home and even people in France have been massive,” Foster told reporters.\\n   \\n      “We know it’s two great teams out there. Different styles. They’re great at their style, we want to be great at ours,” added Foster.\\n   \\n      A trio of Barrett brothers – Scott, Jordie and Beauden – will start the game for the three-time winner, while winger Will Jordan knows he can achieve a new mark for most tries at a World Cup if he can add to the eight he already has.\\n   \\n      After almost two months of intense, gripping action, we now have a World Cup final re-match 28 years in the making as the two top-ranked teams in the world battle it out in front of 80,000 fans at the Stade de France in Paris as they chase a special piece of history.\\n  ',\n",

       "  'contents': ' \\n      A mother’s love does have limits, it seems. At least for a 75-year-old woman in the northern Italian city of Pavia who won a court order after suing to have her sons, aged 40 and 42, removed from her house, a court clerk in Pavia told CNN\\xa0Friday.\\n   \\n      The two sons, described in court papers by their mother as “parasites,”\\xa0had been living\\xa0in the family apartment without\\xa0contributing financially or helping around the house, according to the complaint filed by the woman, who has not been named, in a the\\xa0Tribunal of Pavia district\\xa0court.\\xa0Both men are\\xa0employed, the court documents state.\\n   \\n      Judge Simona Caterbi sided with the retired mother, who is separated from the men’s father and whose pension went entirely on food and maintenance of the home, ruling that the two\\xa0“bamboccioni,” or big babies, have until December 18 to vacate the premises, according to Tuesday’s court ruling,\\xa0seen by CNN.\\n   \\n      Caterbi wrote: “There is no provision in the legislation which attributes to the adult child the unconditional right to remain in the home exclusively owned by the parents, against their will and by virtue of the family bond alone.”\\n   \\n      The men, who hired lawyers to fight the maternal eviction, according to the local newspaper La Provincia Pavese, argued that Italian parents are required by law to take care of their children as long as necessary.\\n   \\n      Caterbi cited the existing law in her ruling and agreed that “the stay in the property could initially be considered well founded because the law is based on the maintenance obligation incumbent on the parent.”\\n   \\n      She then ruled that “it no longer appears justifiable considering the two defendants are subjects over 40 and once a certain age has been exceeded, the child can no longer expect the parents to continue the maintenance obligation beyond limits that are no longer reasonable.”\\n   \\n      A lawyer for the men told local media that the men had not decided if they would appeal the court decision.\\n   \\n      This is not the first time “mammoni,” an Italian term used to describe adult men who are too dependent on their mothers, has cropped up in the legal system.\\n   \\n      In 2020, Italy’s\\xa0Supreme Court\\xa0ruled\\xa0against\\xa0a 35-year-old man who worked as a\\xa0part-time music teacher\\xa0who still expected financial support from his parents\\xa0after he argued that he could not support himself on an annual salary of 20,000 euros ($21,100).\\n   \\n      On average, Italians leave their parental home at the average age of 30, according to Eurostat 2022 data. Croatia is\\xa0the\\xa0highest in the European Union, with an\\xa0average age of 33.4 years.

       " {'headline': '\\n      The Japanese city that dominates street food – and no, it’s not Tokyo\\n    ',\n",
       "  'contents': ' \\n      Fukuoka, Japan’s sixth largest city by population, has more open-air food stalls than the rest of the country combined.\\n   \\n      These stalls are called yatais, and they’re an indelible part of what makes Fukuoka’s food scene so special.\\n   \\n      Think of them as a sort of foodie Cinderella.\\n   \\n      Yatais are assigned specific, highly coveted spots at major pedestrian thoroughfares.\\n   \\n      However, they can only operate at night and must completely dismantle or remove their stalls before morning commuters begin swarming the sidewalks. The only clue that a yatai might materialize later is a ground-level water spigot.\\n   \\n      But at night, the city transforms. Carts and vans seem to appear by magic, serving everything from gyoza (in Fukuoka, these popular dumplings are served in mini, bite-size form) to ramen to meat skewers to a local chicken hotpot stew called oden, paired with ice-cold Asahi or Sapporo beers.\\n   \\n      “Yatai is the best place to make friends,” says Nick Szasz, a Canadian-born longtime resident of Japan who runs the English-language website Fukuoka Now. “Especially in the winter.”\\n   \\n      Most carts can only fit between 6-10 people, who are encouraged to squeeze in together on shared benches or closely crammed stools. During the cold season, many yatais keep customers warm by enclosing their benches in thick curtains, making the experience even more cozy.\\n   \\n      While the Japanese sometimes have a reputation for polite formality, Szasz explains that it’s considered good manners to chitchat with strangers while crammed in together at a yatai. Some carts even have the option to buy drinks for other diners – or the chef! – as a menu item.\\n   \\n      Had Fukuoka gone in another direction, yatai might have become a thing of the past. The loose, unaffiliated system of carts was unregulated and varied wildly in safety and quality.\\n   \\n      Enter Sōichirō Takashima, who has been the mayor of Fukuoka since 2010. When elected, he was just 36, the youngest mayor in Fukuoka’s history and one of the youngest in all of Japan.\\n   \\n      Japan has the “grayest” population in the world, with at least one in 10 residents over the age of 80.\\n   \\n      But Fukuoka, the largest city on the island of Kyushu, is bucking that trend. Takashima’s administration has wooed recent college graduates and young entrepreneurs from around the country with small-business loans, affordable rent and co-working spaces.\\n   \\n      One of the big initiatives pushed by the mayor – who was reelected to a fourth term in 2022 – was an overhaul of the yatais.\\n   \\n      Though the city has always been dotted with these food carts, Takashima’s administration set up a committee to regulate them and make sure they’d remain a vital part of the city.\\n   \\n      The committee established some baseline rules for yatais, such as a maximum of 120 carts (there are currently 96 registered), a requirement that prices be displayed in an obvious place, and a ban on raw foods – so, if you want to try Fukuoka’s famously fresh sashimi, you’ll need to head to a brick-and-mortar restaurant.\\n   \\n      But rather than restrict the yatai community, the industry cleanup has led to a new, younger generation of yatai operators who are trying out new styles and flavors to keep locals coming back.\\n   \\n      At Telas & Mico, Kensuke Kubota – who trained at London’s Zuma before moving back to Japan – serves Italian-style bruschetta topped with mentaiko, a spicy cod roe that is Fukuoka’s most ubiquitous condiment.\\n   \\n      And food isn’t the only draw. Many carts have special designs or styles that give a sense of personality beyond what’s on the menu.\\n   \\n      Telas & Mico, for example, is painted an electric-blue color that stands out on the busy, crowded sidewalk by the Nianjin train station. The proprietor of Yatai Keiji in the fashionable Akasaka neighborhood used to work as a carpenter for Shinto shrines, so he made his cart look like a shrine too.\\n   \\n      Some have even stopped selling food entirely, becoming bars that cater to yatai-hoppers looking for a final stop on the way home.\\n   \\n      Fukuoka’s local tourism authority has made an English-language website with yatai maps and tips.\\n   \\n      The website notes that yatais, despite all the new rules, can still be unpredictable – an owner may decide not to bother opening one night if there’s bad weather, or if a chef is ill.\\n   \\n      But the element of surprise is one of the things that makes street food so much fun, and that goes double in Fukuoka.\\n  ',\n",

Beijing cut off the communications after then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan last year, infuriating Chinese leaders.\\n   \\n      “I’ve asked to speak with my counterparts, the eastern and southern theater commanders now, going on two and a half years,”\\xa0INDOPACOM commander Adm. John Aquilino said earlier this month. “I have yet to have one of those requests accepted.”\\n   \\n      As part of the latest National Defense Strategy, the US has pointed to China as the “pacing challenge,” capable of competing with America in terms of its military might, economic power and international reach. Beijing already possesses a standing army of more than one million soldiers, the largest navy in the world by number of ships and the largest air force in the region.\\n   \\n      Beijing claims “indisputable sovereignty” over almost all of the South China Sea, and uses its military might to assert its claims of sovereignty in the disputed waters and beyond, including Taiwan.\\n   \\n      In 2022, the Chinese military increased its aggressive actions towards the island, including ballistic missile overflights, military aircraft flying into Taiwan’s aerial identification zone and major exercises near Taiwan.

       "  'contents': ' \\n  Editor’s Note: Sign up for\\xa0Unlocking the World, CNN Travel’s weekly newsletter. Get the latest news in aviation, food and drink, where to stay and other travel developments.\\n \\n      In our latest roundup of travel news: great cities for world-class cocktails, Japanese street food and Michelin-starred fine dining, plus father-son and grandmother-granddaughter aviation teams taking to the skies.\\n   \\n      And with Halloween on the horizon, find out why “tombstone tourists” find cemeteries so fascinating.\\n   \\n      Where do you go to find the world’s best bar? For the past two years in a row, it’s been Barcelona. Intimate cocktail joint Sips, a 33-seat venue that opened during the Covid pandemic, scooped the prestigious 2023 award this month, after speakeasy Paradiso took last year’s crown.\\n   \\n      And for Asian street food, one Japanese city has more open-air food stalls than the rest of the country combined. Here’s how Fukuoka came to rule Japan’s yatai (food cart) scene.\\n   \\n      Finally, Michelin-starred dining has arrived in Georgia’s capital city, with five Atlanta restaurants being awarded one Michelin star on October 24. The prestigious French travel guide praised the city’s “dynamic culinary landscape” and “diverse offerings.”\\n   \\n      A grandmother and granddaughter flight attendant duo recently hit the skies on a Southwest Airlines flight over California. Hannah Heck, 24, was inspired by her jetsetting grandma to begin an aviation career. So when the two ended up working for the same airline, Cynthia Heck, 72, worked behind the scenes to make sure she was on Hannah’s first flight.\\n   \\n      Ruben Flowers and his son Ruben share more than just a name: Little Ruben grew up wanting to be just like his pilot dad, and a 1994 photo shows the toddler son gazing up with admiration in the airplane flight deck as his uniformed father prepared to fly a plane. Almost 30 years later, the pair recreated the photo — but this time young Ruben, 30, is in uniform too, about to follow in his father’s footsteps and begin flying as a First Officer, also for Southwest Airlines.\\n   \\n      Technological innovations are making travel simpler and simpler. Take the luggage tracking device, the must-have item for the savvy traveler. When athlete Gray Barnett’s $12,000 bike went missing between France and South Carolina, he and his dad tracked it to Brussels Airport — where a helpful airport staff member was able to save the day.\\n   \\n      Live translation is also constantly improving. And in Japan, always a tech front-runner, Tokyo metro has introduced a futuristic screen that can instantly translate conversations into 12 languages. Watch how it works here.\\n   \\n      Finally, Google Flights has a new feature to help travelers save money and reveals the most searched winter holiday spots. And when the time comes to turn your vacation clips into mini masterpieces, our partners at CNN Underscored, a product reviews and recommendations guide owned by CNN, have this roundup of the best video editing apps for mobile in 2023.\\n   \\n      This emperor penguin chick is the first to hatch at SeaWorld San Diego in over 10 years. Staff say she’s now thriving on a diet of fish and “fish milkshakes.”\\n   \\nThis haunting picture of a horseshoe crab won Wildlife Photographer of the Year 2023.\\n \\n      But how does it compare to the animal antics in the Comedy Wildlife Photo Awards?\\n   \\nThis couple quit their jobs and sold everything to drive around the world with their two children.\\xa0\\n \\n      Their mission is to protect the environment.\\n   \\nOn India’s Coromandel Coast, there’s a forgotten Danish outpost.\\xa0\\n \\nTranquebar was the European nation’s foothold in India from 1620 to 1845.\\n   \\nThis island was once a barren moonscape lorded over by rats.\\xa0\\n \\n      Now the newly restored Redonda is a Caribbean wildlife haven.\\n  ',\n",

       "  'contents': ' \\nSign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter.\\xa0Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\\n \\n      Scientists have detected a surprising amount of a rare version of helium, called helium-3, in volcanic rocks on Canada’s Baffin Island, lending support to the theory that the noble gas is leaking from Earth’s core — and has been for millennia.\\n   \\n      The research team also detected helium-4 within the rocks.\\n   \\n      While helium-4 is common on Earth, helium-3 is more readily found elsewhere in the cosmos, which is why scientists were surprised to detect a larger amount of the element than had been previously reported from the rocks on Baffin Island. A study describing the discovery published recently in the journal Nature.\\n   \\n      “At the most basic level, there is little 3He (helium-3) in the universe compared to 4He (helium-4),” said lead study author Forrest Horton, associate scientist in the department of geology and geophysics at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, in an email.\\n   \\n      “3He is rare in Earth because it has not been produced in or added to the planet in significant quantities and it is lost to space,” Horton added. “As Earth’s rocky portion stirs and convects like hot water on a stove top, material ascends, cools, and sinks.During the cooling stage, helium is lost to the atmosphere and then to space.”\\n   \\n      Detecting elements that leak from Earth’s core can help scientists unlock insights into how our planet formed and evolved over time, and the new findings provide evidence to bolster an existing hypothesis about how our planet came to be.\\n   \\n      Baffin Island, located in the territory of Nunavut, is the largest island in Canada. It’s also the fifth-largest island in the world.\\n   \\n      A high ratio of helium-3 to helium-4 was first detected in Baffin Island volcanic rocks by Solveigh Lass-Evans as part of her doctoral studies under the supervision of University of Edinburgh scientist Finlay Stuart. Their findings were published in Nature in 2003.\\n   \\n      The composition of a planet is a reflection of the elements that formed it, and previous research found that trace amounts of helium-3 leaking from Earth’s core supports the popular theory that our planet originated in a solar nebula — a cloud of gas and dust that likely collapsed due to the shock wave of a nearby supernova — which contained the element.\\n   \\n      Horton and his colleagues took it a step further when they conducted research on Baffin Island in 2018, studying the lava that erupted millions of years ago when Greenland and North America split apart, making way for a new seafloor. They wanted to investigate the rocks that may contain insights about the contents locked within Earth’s core and mantle, the mostly solid layer of Earth’s interior located beneath its surface.\\n   \\n      The researchers traveled by helicopter to reach the remote, otherworldly landscape of the island, where lava flows have formed towering cliffs, giant icebergs float by and polar bears stalk the coastline. Local organizations, including the Qikiqtani Inuit Association and Nunavut Research Institute, provided the researchers with access, advice and protection from the bears, Horton said.\\n   \\n      “This area on Baffin Island holds special importance both as sacred lands for the local communities and as a scientific window into the deep Earth,” he said.\\n   \\n      The Arctic rocks that Horton and his team investigated revealed surprisingly higher measurements of helium-3 and helium-4 than was reported by previous research, and the measurements varied among the samples they collected.\\n   \\n      “Many of the lavas are full of bright green olivine (also known as the gemstone peridot), so breaking off fresh pieces with a rock hammer was as thrilling as breaking apart geodes as a kid: each rock was a treasure to be discovered,” Horton said. “And what scientific treasures they turned out to be!”\\n   \\n      Only about one helium-3 atom exists for every million helium-4 atoms, Horton said. The team measured about 10 million helium-3 atoms per gram of olivine crystals.\\n   \\n      “Our high 3He/4He measurements imply that gases, presumably inherited from the solar nebula during solar system formation, are better preserved in Earth than previously thought,” he said.\\n   \\n      But how did the helium-3 end up in the rocks in the first place?\\n   \\n      The answer may begin as far back as the big bang, which, when it created the universe, also released an abundance of hydrogen and helium. These elements were incorporated into the formation of galaxies over time.\\n   \\n      Scientists believe our solar system formed 4.5 billion years ago within a solar nebula. As the dust cloud collapsed in a supernova, the resulting material formed a spinning disk that eventually gave rise to our sun and the planets, according to NASA.\\n   \\n      Helium inherited from the solar nebula likely became locked in Earth’s core as the planet formed, making the core a reservoir of noble gases. As helium-3 leaked from the core, it ascended to the surface through the mantle in the form of magma plumes that eventually erupted on Baffin Island.\\n   \\n      “During the eruption, the vast majority of the gases in the magma escaped to the atmosphere,” Horton said. “Only the olivine crystals that grew prior to eruption trapped and preserved the helium from the deep Earth.”\\n   \\n      The new research supports the idea that helium-3 is leaking from Earth’s core and has been for some time, but the researchers aren’t entirely sure when this process began.\\n   \\n      “The lavas are about 60 million years old, and the ascent of the mantle plume took perhaps tens of millions of years,” Horton said. “So, the helium we measured in these rocks would have escaped the core perhaps 100 million years ago or possibly much earlier.”\\n   \\n      Helium leaking from Earth’s core doesn’t affect our planet or have any negative implications, he said. The noble gas does not chemically react with matter, so it won’t have an impact on humanity or the environment.\\n   \\n      Next, the research team wants to investigate whether the core is a storehouse of other light elements, which could account for the why Earth’s outer core is less dense than expected.\\n   \\n      “Is the core a major repository of elements like carbon and hydrogen, which are so important in terms of planetary habitability? If so, have fluxes of these elements from the core over (Earth’s) history influenced planetary evolution? I am excited to investigate links between helium and other light elements,” Horton said. “Perhaps helium can be used to track other elements across the core-mantle boundary.”\\n  ',\n",

       " {'headline': '\\n      Norway’s fastest – and most famous – running family is ripped apart by allegations of ‘aggression and physical punishment’\\n    ',\n",
       "  'contents': ' \\n      In a quiet corner of a Tokyo stadium, a father wipes tears away from his eyes. He has just watched his 20-year-old son win a\\xa0first Olympic gold in thrilling fashion,\\xa0patiently chasing down and passing\\xa0fierce Kenyan rival Timothy Cheruiyot on the final bend of the 1,500-meter\\xa0final.\\n   \\n      The moment would be an emotional one for any parent, but even more so if you have coached your son throughout his running career. Such was the case for Gjert Ingebrigtsen, who\\xa0was the coach to three of his seven children: Henrik, Filip and Jakob, the one who raced to Olympic gold in Tokyo two years ago.\\n   \\n      Today, however, the family dynamic has shifted. The three running brothers ended their coaching relationship with their father last year, prompting a swathe of speculation about a potential rift in Norway’s fastest – and\\xa0most famous\\xa0– sporting family.\\n   \\n      Now the three brothers have spoken publicly about the reasons for no longer being coached by their father, alleging that he is aggressive, controlling and has used physical violence and threats towards them.\\n   \\n      “We still feel discomfort and fear, which lays within us since childhood,” Henrik, Filip, and Jakob wrote in a story for Norwegian newspaper VG, which was published last week.\\n   \\n      “Somehow, we have accepted this. We have lived with it, and in adult age we have moved on. At least we thought so. In retrospect, we realize that it was naive.”\\n   \\n      They said that two years ago, a few months before ending their coaching relationship with their father, “the same aggression and physical punishment struck again. That was the final straw.”\\n   \\n      Gjert Ingebrigtsen has denied these accusations. In comments sent to CNN Sport via his legal representative, Elden Advokatfirma, he said: “The statements that my\\xa0sons\\xa0made are baseless. I have never used violence against my children.\\n   \\n      “That I have had weaknesses as a father, and have been too much of a coach, is a realization I have also come to\\xa0–\\xa0albeit far too late.”\\n   \\n      On Thursday, Norwegian police said that they had carried out “preliminary investigations” into the brothers’\\xa0allegations and have now opened a case under a criminal code relating to “abuse in close relationships.”\\n   \\n      In a statement shared with CNN Sport, inspector Terese Braut Våge said: “This means that we are now in an investigation phase, where the purpose of the investigation is to uncover whether there are criminal circumstances.”\\n   \\n      John Christian Elden, the lawyer representing Gjert, told CNN Sport that his client has not yet been charged with any criminal offense.\\n   \\n      “This was not unexpected, and my client is confident of the outcome of such an investigation,” said Elden, adding that it is Gjert’s “only opportunity to be cleared of any wrongdoing.”\\n   \\n      The brothers’ account of their relationship with their father in VG did not provide details about specific instances of abuse or physical violence.\\xa0And days after the story was published, another Ingebrigtsen brother, Martin, who is not a professional athlete, defended Gjert, telling VG: “Fortunately, fear is an unknown feeling to me. I never feared dad.\\n   \\n      “I must honestly admit that I find it difficult to see this great fear, when others in the family are constantly visiting and have recently been on holiday with Gjert.”\\n   \\n      In an interview with the New York Times last year, Jakob spoke about the tension within the family, saying: “Our father is really anxious and that affects everybody around him. And that quickly evolves to anger towards competitions. Because he’s anxious and he has nerves and he responds by getting irritated and angry about the little stuff.”\\n   \\n      CNN has contacted representatives for the Ingebrigtsen brothers for further comment.\\n   \\n      Henrik, 32, Filip, 30, and Jakob, 23, are all decorated middle and long-distance runners.\\xa0Jakob, however, is the family’s most\\xa0successful\\xa0athlete, winning world and Olympic titles and setting indoor records over 1,500m\\xa0and 2,000m.\\n   \\n      “Jakob is one of the best and biggest athletes in Norway – like [soccer players] Erling Haaland and Martin Ødegaard, or [golfer]\\xa0Viktor Hovland,” Herman Folvik, a sports journalist for VG, told CNN Sport.\\n   \\n      But it’s not for their running prowess alone that the brothers have gained\\xa0celebrity status\\xa0in Norway.\\xa0Team Ingebrigtsen, a documentary series first aired in 2016, has shed light on the family dynamic, particularly the father-coach relationship between Gjert and his sons.\\n   \\n      “I would say that after the royal family, I think they are the most famous family in Norway,” said Folvik. “[The documentary] about the running brothers and Gjert also got really close to the mother [Tone] and the other siblings.”\\n   \\n      The brothers and Gjert announced their split in February 2022, less than a year after Jakob had won gold at the Tokyo Olympics.\\n   \\n      In their story in VG, which was published on October 19,\\xa0Henrik, Filip, and Jakob\\xa0explained how media scrutiny of their relationship with Gjert had compelled them to speak publicly about their family environment.\\n   \\n      “When we broke with Gjert, we thought we would be able to handle the situation in an orderly manner, without mentioning the underlying circumstances,” they said.\\n   \\n      “We now realize that is not possible. This matter has become so inflamed, and has had such great consequences, that we feel a responsibility to clean it up.”\\n   \\n      They described the situation as a “family conflict” and said that they now hope to achieve “peace for all parties.”\\n   \\n      In his comments to CNN Sport, Gjert lamented the “tragic situation” for the Ingebrigtsens.\\n   \\n      “Our family has lived in the public spotlight for many years, and we have chosen to let the public into our lives through TV series, interviews and much more,” he said.\\n   \\n      “That violence should have occurred in this public family life is unthinkable. The Norwegian people have seen our lives, for better or for worse … I don’t know how we’re going to get past this – but we have to try.”\\n   \\n      The situation between the father and his three sons is complicated by the fact that Gjert is currently coaching another Norwegian athlete, Narve Gilje Nordås, who won a bronze medal in the 1,500 meters at this year’s world championships – finishing fractionally behind Jakob.\\n   \\n      The Norwegian Athletics Federation has recently said that Gjert would not be granted accreditation as a coach for international competitions – next year’s world indoor championships and European championships.\\n   \\n      In two separate statements, the federation said that it wants to create a “safe environment” for athletes and made reference to comments made by the Ingebrigtsen brothers in the media.\\xa0It also said that it would recommend that Gjert would not receive accreditation for next year’s Paris Olympics.\\n   \\n      Nordås, meanwhile, has said that he plans to make a statement in the coming days. He has called the situation absurd and said he continues to train with Gjert.\\n   \\n      As for Jakob, he is essentially self-coached but continues to lean on his older brothers for advice. Still arguably the most dominant middle-distance runner in the world, he holds lofty ambitions for his track and field career.\\n   \\n      “I don’t want to sound immodest,” he said in an interview earlier this year, “but my main goal is to become the best runner of all time, for which I still have a lot of work to do.”\\n  ',\n",

In August, Pharrell told GQ Magazine that designing accessories was something he was eager to tackle in the Louis Vuitton top job. “One of the things I wanted to do when I got here was I definitely wanted to work on the bags,” he said. Doubtless it’s a dedication appreciated by the likes of James, Elordi, A$AP and Tyler, whose street style looks contribute further proof — were any needed — that man purses are enjoying a newfound socio-cultural appreciation. Because at the end of the day, manbags shouldn’t carry so much baggage.\\n  ',\n",

Indeed, men wearing bags are consistently the butt of jokes in internet memes, comic strips, and even\\xa0 stand-up comedy sets. “You better keep a gun in here bro,” comic Andrew Schulz told a male audience member who attended a 2019 show wearing a small leather satchel.\\n   \\n      But the tide is changing. In August, Pharrell told GQ Magazine that designing accessories was something he was eager to tackle in the Louis Vuitton top job. “One of the things I wanted to do when I got here was I definitely wanted to work on the bags,” he said. Doubtless it’s a dedication appreciated by the likes of James, Elordi, A$AP and Tyler, whose street style looks contribute further proof — were any needed — that man purses are enjoying a newfound socio-cultural appreciation. Because at the end of the day, manbags shouldn’t carry so much baggage.\\n  ',\n",

       "  'contents': ' \\n      For most people, jumping off a platform which hangs 66-feet in the air from a cliff with just deep open water below is a terrifying prospect, but for high diver and influencer Molly Carlson it is a chance to be free. It is her time to fly.\\n   \\n      For the self-described “professional athlete with anxiety,” these dizzying heights are where she feels most at peace. Cliff diving helped the 25-year-old recover from what she calls a “year from hell,” overcoming loneliness and a binge eating disorder. It is, she says, “almost like free therapy.”\\n   \\n      “I’ve enjoyed diving my whole life because it’s that one time where you have to be so in the moment to dive safely and to survive that you can’t be thinking of anything else,” she told CNN Sport.\\n   \\n      “My brain shuts out for the first time and it’s finally silence up here where I can enjoy what I’m doing.\\n   \\n      “When I’m cliff diving, nothing matters other than me and the air, really. It’s like you’re flying.”\\n   \\n      It is not just the spectacular high dives that make Carlson unique – the 25-year-old has gained almost four million followers on TikTok and over 250,000 followers on Instagram not only by documenting her career but also by talking openly about her mental health while encouraging others to do the same.\\n   \\n      “I have the biggest passion for mental health, and I’ve learned so much from my personal experience that now it’s kind of become like my future,” she said.\\n   \\n      “I really want to public speak to athletes on how to prioritize your self-care and ask for help when you need it, because I never want anyone to go through the year of hell that I went through and to feel isolated and alone.”\\n   \\n      Carlson refers to her lowest point as her “mental injury” and is unwaveringly direct about her immense personal battles, which include anxiety and body dysmorphia. Her journey to this more positive current stage has been arduous, but she is determined to support others.\\n   \\n      Born in Fort Frances, Ontario, Canada and raised in Thunder Bay, Carlson originally started out as a gymnast but soon turned her attention to the water, or rather, what was above the water.\\n   \\n      “My sister was a swimmer, and I would have to go and watch her practises and they were so boring,” said Carlson. “But in the corner of the pool was the dive team and they were jumping off these crazy heights. I looked at my mom and I was like, ‘I need to do this sport.’”\\n   \\n      She started diving aged nine and two years later was representing Canada, progressing quickly because, she says, she was a “little daredevil.”\\n   \\n      A decorated junior diver, Carlson won two Pan American Game titles and dived for Team Canada at Nanjing 2014 Youth Olympics.\\n   \\n      It is every athlete’s dream to represent their country at an Olympic Games, and Carlson was no exception, aspiring to compete on the biggest stage of all since she was four years old.\\n   \\n      However, her determination to make the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Games took a toll on the then 17-year-old. Making the Canadian team became her everything, leading her down a “dark path.”\\n   \\n      She developed a binge eating disorder and other mental health issues which stemmed, she said, from being taller than her diving peers.\\n   \\n      “I was 5-foot-8-inches, and my competitors were 5-foot-2-inches,” Carlson explained. “In my head, I was like, ‘I need to be smaller to go to the Olympics.’\\n   \\n      “Believing this negative thought led me down that dark path and I missed out on the Olympics – top two go and I was fourth place.”\\n   \\n      Falling short of a lifelong goal was a wake-up call. She “hated” herself at the time and realized that her love for diving was diminishing.\\n   \\n      “What I thought would have been devastation was relief,” she admitted. “It was the first time I realized ‘Okay, I do need help, and maybe if I ask for help, I can learn to love myself and diving all over again.’\\n   \\n      “It was a blessing in disguise not making that Olympic team.”\\n   \\n      Carlson continued diving at college, heading to Florida State University (FSU).\\n   \\n      Still on her path to recovery, she opened up to her diving coach, John Proctor, about her mental health as soon as she appeared on campus as she “did not want to start her four years at the university with a lie.” Proctor immediately put her in touch with a nutritionist and a mental health coach.\\n   \\n      That conversation left Carlson feeling empowered, she said, and was a catalyst for her success. She had a decorated career as a Florida State Seminole, winning NCAA All-American and Atlantic Coast Conference Diver of the Year honors three times.\\n   \\n      After her college career was put on hold by the pandemic, Proctor suggested the switch to high diving, in which you enter the water feet first, after indoor diving became impractical due to multiple wrist injuries.\\n   \\n      Initially apprehensive and seeking further opinions, Carlson put the question to her Instagram followers, posting a poll on her story asking if she should give cliff diving a try. The results were 99% in favor, with the lone vote against the idea coming from her mother.\\n   \\n      “Being the first in the world to do a lot of things does not sit easy with my mum,” Carlson laughed.\\n   \\n      “She couldn’t watch me do regular diving, she would wait to hear the clapping and then celebrate – ‘You didn’t even watch it!’\\n   \\n      “I send her videos just to build her confidence, but she’s physically been to an event and watch me do a dive, so that is progress.”\\n   \\n      After impressing during practise sessions, she was offered the opportunity to take part in the 2021 Red Bull Cliff Diving World Series as a wild card. Carlson finished second in her debut event, and third in the overall table that season.\\n   \\n      She improved the next year, this time on a full-time basis as one of 12 female professionals, placing second behind five-time winner Rhiannan Iffland. She is currently second in the championship heading into the final event next month.\\n   \\n      Carlson trains in Montreal, which houses a 20-meter indoor platform, the city where she “fell in love” with the sport.\\n   \\n      “[At first] My coach and I didn’t know what we were doing, because so few people do this sport that we were the guinea pigs,” she said “We were trying every dive ever, and some dives that we shouldn’t have been doing!”\\n   \\n      Alongside a successful start to her cliff diving career, Carlson has also built a substantial following on social media, where she documents her daily life to millions of people.\\n   \\n      The uniqueness of her content is what stands out: from standing on a podium with a medal around her neck to having a panic attack in the build-up of an important competition, Carlson shares her cliff diving and mental health journey in detail.\\n   \\n      Inspired by the conversation she had with her diving coach at college and her upbringing, where the “stigma around mental health was massive,” Carlson wants to use her platform to raise awareness about a taboo so many people are scared to talk about.\\n   \\n      “What I learned during my experience was as soon as you talk about mental health with one person, it becomes real,” Carlson said.\\n   \\n      “I used to think Instagram had to be perfect. I grew up when it came out and everything was a highlight of your life, and if it’s not your best moments, you can’t post it.\\n   \\n      “Every time I post that today is not a good day, I didn’t feel I was in the right mindset to do a dive from 66 feet, and I share that story with four million people and they’re like, ‘Wow, I didn’t know I could say no’, that’s so exciting.\\n   \\n      “When I’m vulnerable, I feel like I also help my followers to be vulnerable,” she added.\\n   \\n      After a 12-year-old girl messaged Carlson and shared her struggles to go to school because of her anxiety, the high diver realized the power her videos have on young people’s lives.\\n   \\n      “I feel like a mom watching my kids, it’s so inspirational,” Carlson said.\\n   \\n      “It reminds me that what I’m doing is impacting lives and I should keep going.”\\n   \\n      She is the founder of the #BraveGang – videos with this hashtag have over one billion views on TikTok. She describes the tag as a community where her followers can support each other by sharing their experiences about overcoming their fears and opening up about mental health.\\n   \\n      “Everyone has their own brave story,” Carlson believes.\\n   \\n      “#BraveGang started in the kitchen with my mum. I was brainstorming in my comments, the amount of times I read ‘brave,’ I was like, ‘We need to incorporate this.’\\n   \\n      “I told all my followers to use this hashtag to share their own brave story, and everyone in the community will be there to support you.\\n   \\n      “And it’s all these inspirational videos of little girls learning their first cartwheel or coming out to their parents – that’s such a big deal and they’re using my hashtag!”\\n   \\n      Dealing with fears is nothing new to the Canadian. Carlson grew up terrified of sharks and still struggles with the phobia to this day, despite regularly jumping into open water. She went shark cage diving in South Africa in an unsuccessful attempt to conquer her fears.\\n   \\n      “I will forever be scared,” she said.\\n   \\n      “I think it’s okay to have fears. If it was limiting me from actually jumping into the water and diving, then I would try to work on it.”\\n   \\n      Though it is yet to fully break into the mainstream, high diving is a growing sport.\\n   \\n      It made its debut at the World Aquatics Championships in 2013 and there were calls for it to be added to the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles, with Carlson one of the most vocal among them, though it was not one of the five new sports added to the program this month.\\n   \\n      “The more we go viral, the more people learn about this sport,” says Carlson. “We’ve created this excitement around the sport, and we’ve showed how fun it can really be.”\\n   \\n      For Carlson, competing in high diving at the Olympics would be more than just representing her country on the national stage.\\n   \\n      “It would be a full circle moment because when I was trying to achieve my dream of the Olympics back in 2016, I didn’t love myself and I wasn’t enjoying it. But now that I do love myself and I’ve worked on myself, it would show that you can love yourself and achieve your dreams.”\\n   \\n      Getting her sport into the Games is just one of the 25-year-old’s long-term ambitions – she aims to finally dethrone Iffland and clinch the World Series title, and wants to make a splash outside of the water as well.\\n   \\n      Making Brave Gang into its own brand and starting a foundation is a goal of hers, as is public speaking. She is just as focused on her legacy as she is on her next dive.\\n   \\n      “When I’m done diving, it doesn’t mean the Brave Gang’s over and I want to keep it alive as long as I can.”\\n  ',\n",

       " {'headline': '\\n      Two strangers moved into an apartment in Prague. Then they fell in love\\n    ',\n",
       "  'contents': ' \\n      Mandy Sanchez was sitting in her bedroom in Texas when she saw the listing.\\n   \\n      A spacious room in an Art Nouveau building in the buzzy Vinohrady neighborhood, near the city’s Riegrovy Sady park, known for its beautiful sunsets.\\n   \\n      It was December 2019. Mandy was a 22-year-old about to graduate Texas A&M University. She was planning to move to Prague to teach English.\\n   \\n      She’d joined a Facebook group called “Flatshare in Prague”, hoping to find somewhere to live. The Vinohrady room was advertised by a Facebook user called Marcus Wecksten. Alongside photos of the apartment, Marcus wrote that the current inhabitants were two guys – one Finnish (Marcus) and one German (his roommate, Boris). Marcus and Boris were both students in Prague and were looking for someone to move in ASAP.\\n   \\n      Mandy thought the apartment looked perfect: great neighborhood, nice-looking space – and the room was within her budget. It was almost too good to be true. She fired off a message right away, expressing her interest.\\n   \\n      Marcus was studying in his bedroom in the Prague apartment when Mandy’s message popped up on his laptop.\\n   \\n      “Sounds great,” he said. “Can you come by sometime next week for a viewing?”\\n   \\n      “I’m in Texas,” explained Mandy. “I’m moving to Prague in January.”\\n   \\n      Marcus considered this. They wouldn’t be able to meet Mandy before she signed the lease, which wasn’t ideal. He wrote back to Mandy, apologizing, explaining it wouldn’t work out.\\n   \\n      But Mandy was determined. “We could Skype?” she suggested. “I really want this room.”\\n   \\n      Marcus – who, back then, was 25 and midway through a medical degree at Prague’s Charles University – had met his roommate Boris at college. The two had lived in the Vinohrady apartment for a couple of years.\\n   \\n      “It was a super-nice apartment in one of the coolest neighborhoods in Prague,” Marcus tells CNN Travel.\\n \\n      A revolving door of fellow students had rented the third room over the years.\\n   \\n      “We were looking for somebody social, who wanted to hang out with us in the communal space, in the living room – that’s where we spent quite a bit of time,” Marcus recalls. “I don’t know what the other requirements were, but probably the basic ones – somebody clean…”\\n   \\n      In the subsequent Skype interview, Mandy recalls Boris being particularly concerned about her potential cleanliness.\\n   \\n      “He asked a lot about if I would help out with the cleaning,” she says. “But I was the one who was more worried about, ‘Are they going to be clean?’ Because it’s two guys…”\\n   \\n      Shared standards of cleanliness confirmed, Mandy, Marcus and Boris spent much of the Skype call talking about the Vinohrady neighborhood and the nearby amenities. Towards the end, they segued into chatting about themselves.\\n   \\n      “I thought that it was super-interesting that Mandy was from Texas,” says Marcus. “I had never met a Texan in my life. I had this stereotypical picture of a Texan in a cowboy hat and boots and a revolver.”\\n   \\n      For her part, Mandy hung up the call with the impression Marcus and Boris were friendly and “normal.”\\n   \\n      “I hung up and basically was like, ‘Okay, they’re not going to murder me. They seem like nice people. I probably could enter their apartment and we would be okay.’”\\n   \\n      After a follow-up call to iron out details, Marcus and Boris offered Mandy the room. By coincidence, this message arrived on the day of Mandy’s college graduation.\\n   \\n      Midway through celebrating her graduation, Mandy filled in her parents and sister on her new home. She extolled its virtues – amazing location, great-looking building, and mentioned in passing that the roommates were two guys who were medical students.\\n   \\n      “My parents were like, ‘We hope you don’t fall in love with either of them, because if you do, that means you’re going to live in Europe forever,’” Mandy recalls.\\n   \\n      “I was like, ‘Why would that be the case?’ And they said, ‘Well, because they’re going to be getting medically licensed in Europe, and then that’s not going to transfer easily to the US. So, if you fall in love with one of them, you’re staying there forever.’”\\n   \\n      Her parents were speaking in jest – at least in part. But Mandy cut through their teasing tone, wanting to set the record straight.\\n   \\n      “That is not what I’m going to Europe for,” she said.\\n   \\n      And it was true.\\n   \\n      “I wasn’t moving there to fall in love,” says Mandy today.\\n   \\n      But the universe had other ideas.\\n   \\n      Mandy had never been to Prague before. She’d scrolled through photos online and marveled at how beautiful it looked. She’d got tips from friends who’d visited and fallen in love with the city. She’d started to imagine herself living in the apartment in Vinohrady.\\n   \\n      But none of this could prepare her for the whirlwind of her arrival day.\\n   \\n      “I don’t really think I was thinking – it was just all happening,” Mandy recalls.\\n   \\n      She remembers getting into an Uber at the airport and peering out the window. It was only 5:30 p.m., but it was already pitch black outside. As she got closer to the city, the spires of Prague Castle were illuminated. Mandy felt a mixture of exhaustion, excitement and disbelief that this new stage of her life had started.\\n   \\n      Meanwhile, Marcus and Boris had spent most of that day deep-cleaning their apartment.\\n   \\n      “We were cleaning corners of the apartment that hadn’t been cleaned in a long time,” says Marcus. “We wanted to make a good impression on Mandy.”\\n   \\n      Marcus had just taken out the last trash bag and dumped it in the communal bins when Mandy’s Uber pulled up in front of the building.\\n   \\n      “She gets out, the driver helped her with her bags,” Marcus recalls. “My first impression is that she’s super-cute. She’s tiny, but she seems to have a lot of energy and she’s very cute.”\\n   \\n      Mandy smiled as the Uber drove away.\\n   \\n      “Oh, you must be Marcus,” she said.\\n   \\n      Marcus reached out his hand for Mandy to shake. The moment was a little awkward, but friendly.\\n   \\n      Then, Marcus took Mandy’s bags and carried them up the stairs.\\n   \\n      “I was like, ‘Oh, that’s very nice that he took my bags. Duly noted,’” recalls Mandy.\\n   \\n      Inside the new apartment, Mandy met Boris and offered to treat her new roommates to take-out.\\n   \\n      The next thing she knew, Marcus was putting through a pizza order on his laptop.\\n   \\n      “I had to awkwardly hand him my credit card,” says Mandy “He’s typing in the details. And then, Google Chrome asks if he wants to save the card. And I was like, ‘You better not save that card information.’”\\n   \\n      Mandy was only half-joking. She recalls thinking: “This is kind of weird. I just met this guy. And I’m giving him my credit card information.”\\n   \\n      For the next couple of hours, Mandy, Marcus and Boris sat around eating pizza and chatting.\\n   \\n      Mandy appreciated how welcoming her new roommates were. And she thought Marcus was “cute.”\\n   \\n      “But also I was tired,” she says. “I was like, ‘Maybe I’m delusional.’”\\n   \\n      After dinner, Mandy, exhausted from the flight, decamped to her bedroom and went to sleep. She woke up wondering if she’d still find Marcus attractive after sleeping off the jet lag. Her question was answered as soon as she saw him in the kitchen, smiling at her.\\n   \\n      Over the next week, Mandy and Marcus got to know each other. They ate dinner out most nights – just the two of them. Boris was always invited, but often had plans and couldn’t join.\\n   \\n      Mandy says she and Marcus “clicked right away.”\\n   \\n      “There was a lot of chemistry between us. But it was chemistry that you’re not sure what you should do with,” she says.\\n   \\n      Mandy was conscious they’d just moved in together – she didn’t want to halt a potential friendship or upset their living situation.\\n   \\n      But Marcus didn’t quite have the same reservations about potentially dating his roommate.\\n   \\n      “I was probably more riding the wave of what was happening,” he says. “I didn’t really think about the potential consequences so much, I was more like, ‘Feels good. Let’s go for it.’”\\n   \\n      Despite Mandy’s hesitations, she and Marcus grew closer and closer. Mandy couldn’t deny what she calls “the immediacy of the draw we had to each other.”\\n   \\n      Before long, they were dating in all but name. They went out to dinner together, explored Prague side by side, and spent hours talking together in the apartment. They traveled out of Prague to the Pilsner Brewery together, enjoying a tour and spending the evening sharing beers. On Valentine’s Day, around a month after she’d moved in, Marcus cooked for Mandy. Boris walked in and raised an eyebrow at the obvious romantic undertones.\\n   \\n      But all the while Mandy and Marcus grew closer, the shadow of coronavirus was becoming harder to ignore. When Mandy arrived in Europe, the pandemic was a distant rumbling of thunder. By early March, the storm had broken over Europe.\\n   \\n      Mandy woke up one morning to an email from her parents. The US border was closing. They’d bought her a plane ticket home.\\n   \\n      “Here’s your plane ticket, it leaves on Thursday, and we have 24 hours to cancel it. So it’s fully refundable,” read the email. “You’re an adult, you can make your own decisions. But we would really like you to come home.”\\n   \\n      Mandy wasn’t sure what to do. If she left, her visa would be nulled and it wouldn’t be easy for her to come back. Her burgeoning connection with Marcus would end before it had even begun.\\n   \\n      But on the flip side, this was a global crisis. Surely it made sense to be with her loved ones in her home country? If she stayed, would she be stuck in Prague indefinitely?\\n   \\n      “I think I’m falling in love,” Mandy thought. “I don’t want this to end. But I also don’t know if this is a mistake not to go home.”\\n   \\n      Boris had already returned to Germany. But Marcus wasn’t sure if he would go back to Finland. He hadn’t spoken the words aloud, but it seemed like he was waiting to see what Mandy would do.\\n   \\n      Over the next 24 hours Mandy flip-flopped between staying and going. Eventually, she and Marcus talked through their options together.\\n   \\n      “We didn’t go out and say, ‘Hey, we will fight through this Covid together, united,’” says Marcus. “It was more carefully trying to pique each other’s interest.”\\n   \\n      “If you stay, I’ll stay,” Mandy and Marcus eventually decided.\\n   \\n      “Once we had decided that we would both stay, it felt very exciting for me,” says Marcus.\\n   \\n      Over the next few months, as Prague descended into a strict lockdown, Mandy and Marcus were together pretty much 24/7.\\n   \\n      Marcus started experimenting with cooking elaborate meals. Mandy would sit on the couch, drinking wine, cheering him on and keeping him company.\\n   \\n      The two spent long evenings sharing stories and talking about their lives.\\n   \\n      “We grew much closer and developed much stronger feelings for each other,” says Marcus. “We spent so much time together, just the two of us and got to open up about stuff.”\\n   \\n      For Marcus, the more introverted of the pair, spending time with Mandy at home was the ideal way to get to know her properly.\\n   \\n      “I felt quite comfortable and safe in that home environment,” he says. “So I felt like I could be myself. And also with Mandy – just her personality meant it was very easy to be myself.”\\n   \\n      Mandy found it harder to be in the moment. She loved spending time with Marcus, but she couldn’t help but worry about the potential future complications of dating someone from a different country.\\n   \\n      She also struggled not to let the grim realities of the pandemic infiltrate their bubble.\\n   \\n      “Everything was still quite up in the air,” she recalls. “We hadn’t defined the relationship, but I stayed for this man, basically. And I’ve just moved here, and I’m still under a visa process that’s ongoing, and the world is up in flames and all of these things…So it wasn’t necessarily like, ‘Oh, I feel safe and at home with you.’ It was pretty hectic for me still.”\\n   \\n      Despite this, Mandy recalls many bright spots.\\n   \\n      “We spent a lot of time in the park, drinking prosecco and having a grand old time,” she says.\\n   \\n      Prague, usually packed with tourists, was sleepy and empty.\\n   \\n      Mandy and Marcus recall “walking on the Charles Bridge, and absolutely no one was there.”\\n   \\n      Despite the grim circumstances, the empty city “was pretty cool.”\\n   \\n      Summer rolled around, Prague’s pandemic restrictions eased a little. Marcus was set to head back to Finland for his summer vacation to work. He was set to be away from the Czech Republic for three months.\\n   \\n      “The night before he left, I’m crying and I’m like, ‘Oh, gosh, you’re leaving and I’m so sad,’” recalls Mandy.\\n   \\n      That was the moment Mandy and Marcus finally spoke their feelings aloud – and confirmed they were committed to being together.\\n   \\n      During their three months apart, Mandy and Marcus only grew more certain of this fact. Mandy recalls phoning her mother, telling her she knew she was in love with Marcus and she hoped he felt the same way.\\n   \\n      When Marcus returned to the apartment in Vinohrady, he told Mandy he was in love with her.\\n   \\n      “Thank goodness,” said Mandy, laughing.\\n   \\n      It was then that she finally let herself relax into this new reality. Marcus was her boyfriend, and despite the stresses that defined 2020, Mandy was happy. She loved living in Prague. She decided to extend her time there, using the pandemic as an excuse – pretty much all her teaching had taken place online, after all, she hadn’t really had the experience she’d planned.\\n   \\n      Whenever she was asked, Mandy was vague about how much longer she’d stay.\\n   \\n      “It was always, ‘A while longer,’” says Mandy. “Never really a defined end.”\\n   \\n      Boris returned to Prague, bemused by how Marcus and Mandy’s relationship had grown in his absence. He was happy for them.\\n   \\n      “I left Mandy and Marcus as two new roommates and met them again when I came back as a well established couple with their own traditions and habits,” Boris tells CNN Travel. “It was a very cute situation to witness.”\\n   \\n      The following summer, in July 2021, Mandy traveled with Marcus to Finland to spend time with his friends and family and get a glimpse into his culture and country.\\n   \\n      “Introducing Mandy to my friends felt really great,” recalls Marcus. “She seemed to click with everyone.”\\n   \\n      “Meeting his family and coming to Finland was that final puzzle piece for me,” says Mandy.\\n   \\n      When the US borders reopened later that year, Marcus traveled with Mandy to Texas to meet Mandy’s loved ones.\\n   \\n      “Her parents and sister, they were all super-embracing and I really felt like I was part of the family from the get-go,” says Marcus.\\n   \\n      After those important introductions, “we felt it was getting more serious,” says Mandy.\\n   \\n      But Mandy and Marcus’ future still felt like it came with a lot of question marks. If they stayed together, where would they live? Mandy’s parents’ initial tongue-in-cheek comments about marrying her medical student roommates still stood – Marcus wouldn’t be able to practice medicine in the US, so living there seemed out of the question.\\n   \\n      During this time, Marcus and Mandy decided to go to couples therapy, figuring it was important to talk through some of these uncertainties.\\n   \\n      “I think that was really helpful for us in terms of – there’s so many things to think about with an intercultural relationship – where we’re going to live and all of these really heavy questions,” says Mandy.\\n   \\n      “We had a really great therapist in Prague, and that really helped us to feel a lot more serious and have a very solid foundation.”\\n   \\n      The couple confirmed they “saw life together” and decided it was OK to just “try to figure it out step by step.”\\n   \\n      “We feel very secure,” says Marcus. “We know that it’s going to be the two of us going forward.”\\n   \\n      Cut to spring 2023, three years since Mandy moved to Prague, and three years since she met Marcus.\\n   \\n      The couple were starting to suspect they’d have to leave the city they both loved. Marcus was about to graduate medical school, and it was looking like it would be easier for him to get a job in Finland.\\n   \\n      To mark three years together, Marcus decided to surprise Mandy with a photoshoot – he figured they’d both appreciate having some nice photos at some of their favorite Prague spots.\\n   \\n      The couple, photographer in tow, headed to a park where the trees were covered in pastel-colored blossoms. Mandy had long been obsessed with the blooming spring trees, she’d never seen anything like them in Texas.\\n   \\n      As the photographer took a couple of preliminary photographs of Mandy, Marcus seized the moment. He knelt behind her. When Mandy turned around, she was initially confused. Then it twigged – he was proposing.\\n   \\n      The subsequent photos captured Mandy’s pure delight. In fact, in all the photos taken that day, Mandy and Marcus are glowing with happiness.\\n   \\n      The shoot concluded on the Charles Bridge. As Mandy and Marcus stood there, looking out over the city arm in arm, Mandy suggested they should celebrate at their favorite restaurant.\\n   \\n      “Well, it depends on how long it takes you to pack,” said Marcus.\\n   \\n      “He’d planned a night or two at a spa hotel in Karlovy Vary, which is a spa town two hours outside of Prague,” explains Mandy.\\n   \\n      The couple spent the rest of the weekend toasting their future.\\n   \\n      This past summer, Marcus and Mandy left Prague and moved to Helsinki, Finland. It was bittersweet saying goodbye to the city that shaped their relationship, but the couple are excited for this next chapter, and plan to stay in Helsinki for the next couple of years.\\n   \\n      Mandy and Marcus will return to Prague next spring for their wedding – a weekend celebration in which friends and family from across the globe, including, of course, their former roommate Boris, will convene in the Czech Republic to celebrate Mandy and Marcus’ love story.\\n   \\n      On their wedding website, Marcus and Mandy listed some of their favorite places in Prague for guests unfamiliar with the city. They eschewed the obvious spots – they’re available for anyone to Google – in favor of the local haunts they loved. Naturally, the Vinohrady apartment is top of that list.\\n   \\n      Marcus and Mandy look back at their time there very fondly. Marcus marvels at the “small, tiny events” that lead them to cross paths, live in that apartment together and fall in love.\\n   \\n      Mandy expresses “how absolutely joyful, smitten, and thankful we are that we allowed ourselves the joy of loving each other – even when we weren’t sure how things would turn out.”\\n   \\n      “We’ve experienced quite a bit in these few years together and are so happy that we get to continue going through life together,” Mandy says. “It’s been the greatest and most unexpected adventure.”\\n  ',\n",

       "  'contents': ' \\n      Mandy Sanchez was sitting in her bedroom in Texas when she saw the listing.\\n   \\n      A spacious room in an Art Nouveau building in the buzzy Vinohrady neighborhood, near the city’s Riegrovy Sady park, known for its beautiful sunsets.\\n   \\n      It was December 2019. Mandy was a 22-year-old about to graduate Texas A&M University. She was planning to move to Prague to teach English.\\n   \\n      She’d joined a Facebook group called “Flatshare in Prague”, hoping to find somewhere to live. The Vinohrady room was advertised by a Facebook user called Marcus Wecksten. Alongside photos of the apartment, Marcus wrote that the current inhabitants were two guys – one Finnish (Marcus) and one German (his roommate, Boris). Marcus and Boris were both students in Prague and were looking for someone to move in ASAP.\\n   \\n      Mandy thought the apartment looked perfect: great neighborhood, nice-looking space – and the room was within her budget. It was almost too good to be true. She fired off a message right away, expressing her interest.\\n   \\n      Marcus was studying in his bedroom in the Prague apartment when Mandy’s message popped up on his laptop.\\n   \\n      “Sounds great,” he said. “Can you come by sometime next week for a viewing?”\\n   \\n      “I’m in Texas,” explained Mandy. “I’m moving to Prague in January.”\\n   \\n      Marcus considered this. They wouldn’t be able to meet Mandy before she signed the lease, which wasn’t ideal. He wrote back to Mandy, apologizing, explaining it wouldn’t work out.\\n   \\n      But Mandy was determined. “We could Skype?” she suggested. “I really want this room.”\\n   \\n      Marcus – who, back then, was 25 and midway through a medical degree at Prague’s Charles University – had met his roommate Boris at college. The two had lived in the Vinohrady apartment for a couple of years.\\n   \\n      “It was a super-nice apartment in one of the coolest neighborhoods in Prague,” Marcus tells CNN Travel.\\n \\n      A revolving door of fellow students had rented the third room over the years.\\n   \\n      “We were looking for somebody social, who wanted to hang out with us in the communal space, in the living room – that’s where we spent quite a bit of time,” Marcus recalls. “I don’t know what the other requirements were, but probably the basic ones – somebody clean…”\\n   \\n      In the subsequent Skype interview, Mandy recalls Boris being particularly concerned about her potential cleanliness.\\n   \\n      “He asked a lot about if I would help out with the cleaning,” she says. “But I was the one who was more worried about, ‘Are they going to be clean?’ Because it’s two guys…”\\n   \\n      Shared standards of cleanliness confirmed, Mandy, Marcus and Boris spent much of the Skype call talking about the Vinohrady neighborhood and the nearby amenities. Towards the end, they segued into chatting about themselves.\\n   \\n      “I thought that it was super-interesting that Mandy was from Texas,” says Marcus. “I had never met a Texan in my life. I had this stereotypical picture of a Texan in a cowboy hat and boots and a revolver.”\\n   \\n      For her part, Mandy hung up the call with the impression Marcus and Boris were friendly and “normal.”\\n   \\n      “I hung up and basically was like, ‘Okay, they’re not going to murder me.

And also with Mandy – just her personality meant it was very easy to be myself.”\\n   \\n      Mandy found it harder to be in the moment. She loved spending time with Marcus, but she couldn’t help but worry about the potential future complications of dating someone from a different country.\\n   \\n      She also struggled not to let the grim realities of the pandemic infiltrate their bubble.\\n   \\n      “Everything was still quite up in the air,” she recalls. “We hadn’t defined the relationship, but I stayed for this man, basically. And I’ve just moved here, and I’m still under a visa process that’s ongoing, and the world is up in flames and all of these things…So it wasn’t necessarily like, ‘Oh, I feel safe and at home with you.’ It was pretty hectic for me still.”\\n   \\n      Despite this, Mandy recalls many bright spots.\\n   \\n      “We spent a lot of time in the park, drinking prosecco and having a grand old time,” she says.\\n   \\n      Prague, usually packed with tourists, was sleepy and empty.\\n   \\n      Mandy and Marcus recall “walking on the Charles Bridge, and absolutely no one was there.”\\n   \\n      Despite the grim circumstances, the empty city “was pretty cool.”\\n   \\n      Summer rolled around, Prague’s pandemic restrictions eased a little. Marcus was set to head back to Finland for his summer vacation to work. He was set to be away from the Czech Republic for three months.\\n   \\n      “The night before he left, I’m crying and I’m like, ‘Oh, gosh, you’re leaving and I’m so sad,’” recalls Mandy.\\n   \\n      That was the moment Mandy and Marcus finally spoke their feelings aloud – and confirmed they were committed to being together.\\n   \\n      During their three months apart, Mandy and Marcus only grew more certain of this fact. Mandy recalls phoning her mother, telling her she knew she was in love with Marcus and she hoped he felt the same way.\\n   \\n      When Marcus returned to the apartment in Vinohrady, he told Mandy he was in love with her.\\n   \\n      “Thank goodness,” said Mandy, laughing.\\n   \\n      It was then that she finally let herself relax into this new reality. Marcus was her boyfriend, and despite the stresses that defined 2020, Mandy was happy. She loved living in Prague. She decided to extend her time there, using the pandemic as an excuse – pretty much all her teaching had taken place online, after all, she hadn’t really had the experience she’d planned.\\n   \\n      Whenever she was asked, Mandy was vague about how much longer she’d stay.\\n   \\n      “It was always, ‘A while longer,’” says Mandy. “Never really a defined end.”\\n   \\n      Boris returned to Prague, bemused by how Marcus and Mandy’s relationship had grown in his absence. He was happy for them.\\n   \\n      “I left Mandy and Marcus as two new roommates and met them again when I came back as a well established couple with their own traditions and habits,” Boris tells CNN Travel. “It was a very cute situation to witness.”\\n   \\n      The following summer, in July 2021, Mandy traveled with Marcus to Finland to spend time with his friends and family and get a glimpse into his culture and country.\\n   \\n      “Introducing Mandy to my friends felt really great,” recalls Marcus. “She seemed to click with everyone.”\\n   \\n      “Meeting his family and coming to Finland was that final puzzle piece for me,” says Mandy.\\n   \\n      When the US borders reopened later that year, Marcus traveled with Mandy to Texas to meet Mandy’s loved ones.\\n   \\n      “Her parents and sister, they were all super-embracing and I really felt like I was part of the family from the get-go,” says Marcus.\\n   \\n      After those important introductions, “we felt it was getting more serious,” says Mandy.\\n   \\n      But Mandy and Marcus’ future still felt like it came with a lot of question marks. If they stayed together, where would they live? Mandy’s parents’ initial tongue-in-cheek comments about marrying her medical student roommates still stood – Marcus wouldn’t be able to practice medicine in the US, so living there seemed out of the question.\\n   \\n      During this time, Marcus and Mandy decided to go to couples therapy, figuring it was important to talk through some of these uncertainties.\\n   \\n      “I think that was really helpful for us in terms of – there’s so many things to think about with an intercultural relationship – where we’re going to live and all of these really heavy questions,” says Mandy.\\n   \\n      “We had a really great therapist in Prague, and that really helped us to feel a lot more serious and have a very solid foundation.”\\n   \\n      The couple confirmed they “saw life together” and decided it was OK to just “try to figure it out step by step.”\\n   \\n      “We feel very secure,” says Marcus. “We know that it’s going to be the two of us going forward.”\\n   \\n      Cut to spring 2023, three years since Mandy moved to Prague, and three years since she met Marcus.\\n   \\n      The couple were starting to suspect they’d have to leave the city they both loved. Marcus was about to graduate medical school, and it was looking like it would be easier for him to get a job in Finland.\\n   \\n      To mark three years together, Marcus decided to surprise Mandy with a photoshoot – he figured they’d both appreciate having some nice photos at some of their favorite Prague spots.\\n   \\n      The couple, photographer in tow, headed to a park where the trees were covered in pastel-colored blossoms. Mandy had long been obsessed with the blooming spring trees, she’d never seen anything like them in Texas.\\n   \\n      As the photographer took a couple of preliminary photographs of Mandy, Marcus seized the moment. He knelt behind her. When Mandy turned around, she was initially confused. Then it twigged – he was proposing.\\n   \\n      The subsequent photos captured Mandy’s pure delight. In fact, in all the photos taken that day, Mandy and Marcus are glowing with happiness.\\n   \\n      The shoot concluded on the Charles Bridge. As Mandy and Marcus stood there, looking out over the city arm in arm, Mandy suggested they should celebrate at their favorite restaurant.\\n   \\n      “Well, it depends on how long it takes you to pack,” said Marcus.\\n   \\n      “He’d planned a night or two at a spa hotel in Karlovy Vary, which is a spa town two hours outside of Prague,” explains Mandy.\\n   \\n      The couple spent the rest of the weekend toasting their future.\\n   \\n      This past summer, Marcus and Mandy left Prague and moved to Helsinki, Finland. It was bittersweet saying goodbye to the city that shaped their relationship, but the couple are excited for this next chapter, and plan to stay in Helsinki for the next couple of years.\\n   \\n      Mandy and Marcus will return to Prague next spring for their wedding – a weekend celebration in which friends and family from across the globe, including, of course, their former roommate Boris, will convene in the Czech Republic to celebrate Mandy and Marcus’ love story.\\n   \\n      On their wedding website, Marcus and Mandy listed some of their favorite places in Prague for guests unfamiliar with the city. They eschewed the obvious spots – they’re available for anyone to Google – in favor of the local haunts they loved. Naturally, the Vinohrady apartment is top of that list.\\n   \\n      Marcus and Mandy look back at their time there very fondly. Marcus marvels at the “small, tiny events” that lead them to cross paths, live in that apartment together and fall in love.\\n   \\n      Mandy expresses “how absolutely joyful, smitten, and thankful we are that we allowed ourselves the joy of loving each other – even when we weren’t sure how things would turn out.”\\n   \\n      “We’ve experienced quite a bit in these few years together and are so happy that we get to continue going through life together,” Mandy says. “It’s been the greatest and most unexpected adventure.”\\n  ',\n",

       " {'headline': '\\n      Why this American couple swapped California for Spain\\n    ',\n",
       "  'contents': ' \\n      After a number of failed IVF rounds, health issues and the death of their beloved dog, US couple Jason Luban and Selena Medlen were in need of a change of scenery.\\n   \\n      The couple, then based in Oakland, California, had penciled in a trip to Andalusia, Spain, months before, but were unsure whether to go ahead with it when the health of Luban, who has torsion dystonia, a rare movement disorder, began to deteriorate.\\n   \\n      “We were figuring out how to get him healthy again,” Medlen tells CNN Travel, before explaining that Luban was also grieving the loss of a friend and mentor. “So we had this vacation on the books, and we weren’t sure if he could travel.”\\n   \\n      According to Medlen, they ultimately decided to “go for it” after Luban, who suffers from insomnia, began sleeping better.\\n   \\n      “We thought, maybe we needed a break,” adds Medlen, who was working as an attorney at the time. “That if we could get away from everything, maybe he would start to feel better.”\\n   \\n      A friend had recommended that the pair, married since 2009, spend some time in Ronda, a town located in Spain’s Malaga province, so they decided to book two nights there.\\n   \\n      But neither could have predicted that they’d end up packing up their lives and relocating there just a few months later.\\n   \\n      In May 2016, they flew into Madrid, spending some time in the capital city, as well as Toledo, Cordoba and Seville, before heading to Ronda.\\n   \\n      “As we left Seville for Ronda, something shifted,” says Luban, an acupuncturist. “The land. The energy. “All [of] the plants were blooming.\\n   \\n      “There were all these colors everywhere. And we were both just in shock at how gorgeous it was as we kept climbing and climbing in the car.”\\n   \\n      When they reached the town, they were greeted by a parade, which set the tone for the rest of the weekend.\\n   \\n      The pair celebrated Medlen’s 38th birthday in Ronda, and say they were struck by how friendly everyone was.\\n   \\n      “Everything kind of came together for just a day or two while we were here,” says Luban, who is originally from Oregon while Medlen is from Texas.\\n   \\n      After wrapping up their time in the pretty town, they went on to visit Granada before returning to the US. But Ronda stayed with them.\\n   \\n      “We went back to our lives, which we realized really sucked compared to what our experience was here [in Ronda,]” admits Luban, before explaining that his insomnia returned once they were back in the US.\\n   \\n      “Also, we both had, unbeknownst to one another, looked in the windows of real estate offices to see what the rental prices were here [in Ronda]. And it was a tenth of what we were paying in California.”\\n   \\n      While lying on the couch one day and reflecting on their fertility struggles, they began discussing what they would want for their lives if they weren’t ever able to have children.\\n   \\n      “Selena said, ‘If we’re not going to have a kid, I want my life to be f**king fabulous,’” recalls Luban. “And we were like, ‘Okay, what does that look like?’”\\n   \\n      They decided that, for them, this would be having the opportunity to live in another country, experience a different culture and learn the language.\\n   \\n      And Spain was now right at the top of their list.\\n   \\n      After sitting down and working out the figures, the couple realized that it would be “affordable” for them to live in Ronda for a year, provided Luban sold his acupuncture practice in California, which he managed to do within six weeks.\\n   \\n      They then whittled down all of their belongings “from two cars and a full house to two suitcases a piece,” and booked an Airbnb in Ronda to stay in before they found something more long-term.\\n   \\n      The pair flew back to Madrid in September 2016.\\n   \\n      “Four months after we left Ronda, we were back to stay,” says Luban. “For what we thought would be a year.”\\n   \\n      But while the town had seemed like a magical place when they’d visited a few months before, it looked far less appealing when they returned shortly after Feria de Pedro Romero, a festival dedicated to bullfighting.\\n   \\n      “We arrived on a Sunday, so it was after the party,” explains Medlen. “Everything was closed.\\n   \\n      “The town was kind of dead and they had not had the opportunity to clean up [from the festival] yet. So it was a really different experience.”\\n   \\n      Luban jokes that they found themselves walking down the road with their suitcases thinking, “Oh my God, what did we do to our lives?”\\n   \\n      Although they’d previously been told that they’d have plenty of options for long-term rentals once they were in Ronda, this turned out not to be the case, and they struggled to find somewhere suitable at first.\\n   \\n      The prices were also slightly higher than they’d estimated, although still more affordable than what they’d been paying in California.\\n   \\n      Despite these initial setbacks, the couple persevered and soon found an apartment. They went on to join a language school in order to learn Spanish, and say that this proved to be a massive turning point for them.\\n   \\n      “It’s probably the reason we stayed,” admits Medlen. “Because it was such a great place for forming community.”\\n   \\n      They began going to various classes four times a week, and were able to meet other expats and discuss their experiences with them, which helped them through the process tremendously.\\n   \\n      “Nobody in the US could relate to what we were doing,” explains Luban. “They all thought it was a great idea until we were going to do it. Then they were like, ‘What are you doing?’”\\n   \\n      As Luban has dual US-German citizenship, he didn’t need a visa to live in Spain. However, Medlen was required to obtain a residence permit.\\n   \\n      While they adapted to the Spanish lifestyle quickly, there were some aspects that they found difficult to get used to.\\n   \\n      “I think we struggled with the siesta concept,” admits Medlen. “We’d be gung-ho to get a bunch of things done, and we’d run into town to do those mundane tasks that we all have to do.\\n   \\n      “But everything’s closed between two and five. So you pretty much can’t do anything.”\\n   \\n      The pair admit that it took them some time to transition from being around expats constantly, to integrating within the Spanish community, and say that this is something that they’re still navigating.\\n   \\n      However, Luban emotionally recalls how the importance of this connection really hit home when he ended up in hospital after a bike accident last year and underwent emergency surgery.\\n   \\n      “It would have been a completely different and much less pleasant experience if we didn’t know people who happen to be nurses and knew the whole community,” Luban explains.\\n   \\n      “Whereas when we first got here, we weren’t part of that community. But we thought we were having our Spain experience with expats.”\\n   \\n      While the couple have private medical insurance, Luban was initially admitted to a public hospital, which wasn’t covered under their policy.\\n   \\n      “Being Americans, we thought, ‘This could ruin us. There goes Spain.’” admits Luban. “The next day, when I was released after I’d had surgery, a night there, my own room and two ambulance rides. They said, ‘Well, we need you to pay the bill. It’s 1,380 euros.’”\\n   \\n      He was particularly moved by the kindness shown by the local community, who dropped off food and constantly checked up on both of them.\\n   \\n      “In America, people would text you gift certificates and sad faces on the phone,” says Luban.\\n   \\n      “Here, people literally showed up at the door when Selena would be coming back from the hospital to give her a hug and tell her that they were going to be there. And they were there. For weeks.”\\n   \\n      While they’d initially planned to stay in Spain for a year, Luban and Medlen chose to extend their stay beyond this.\\n   \\n      The couple admit that watching Donald Trump being elected as president of the United States in November 2016 contributed to their decision to remain in Spain.\\n   \\n      “Once that happened, within a couple of months, our families were saying, ‘Don’t come back,’” says Luban, explaining that their relatives had been eager for them to return before the election result.\\n   \\n      “‘This country is changing. You really should just enjoy yourselves and not get caught up in all of the division that’s happening in the United States.’ That was just two months in.”\\n   \\n      Medlen points out that they both worked constantly while they were in the US, and felt as though they rarely got to spend time together, whereas they’ve been able to enjoy each other’s company a great deal more while living in Spain.\\n   \\n      Meanwhile, Luban’s health has improved during their time there, and he regularly rides with various local cycling groups. However, he says that he’s had his ups and downs “sleep-wise.”\\n   \\n      “The biggest thing is that we can manage our stress much better here,” he says. “When we’re not constantly worrying about our safety, money or whatever.”\\n   \\n      As they only had enough funds to cover a year living in Spain without working, the couple needed to start earning money again in order to extend their time there.\\n   \\n      Fortunately, Medlen was able to take on remote work for law firms in the US and Luban launched a website advising other practitioners on how to sell a medical practice.\\n   \\n      “I’d say we spend one fifth of what we would on food here, rather than California,” Luban estimates. “One eighth to one tenth on our living expenses. One eighth on health care.\\n   \\n      “And we had no idea how much your quality of life goes up when you’re not trying to meet all of those bills.”\\n   \\n      They both try to work around 20 hours a week, and say they’ve been able to live comfortably this way because their money goes much further in Spain.\\n   \\n      “We also have more time to cook, which brings your food bills down because you’re not buying takeout,” adds Medlen. “And we have more time to exercise. So I feel like we’re healthier.”\\n   \\n      Seven years after relocating to Ronda, the couple are very much settled, and even have a dog, named Lola Supernova.\\n   \\n      They say that they re-evaluate their decision each year, and weigh up whether they want to stay in Spain or move on.\\n   \\n      However, they’ve chosen not to buy a home there so that they have a little more freedom.\\n   \\n      “Wa take it to one year increments,” explains Medlen. “And we still rent our apartment that we live in.\\n   \\n      “We want to keep things simple and have flexibility so that we could change our minds and go somewhere else.”\\n   \\n      They return to the US every year and joke that they’re always shocked by how much a burrito at American food chain Chipotle is.\\n   \\n      “There’s been a lot of inflation since we left,” notes Medlen.\\n   \\n      While the couple still sometimes struggle with the prospect of not having children, Luban, now 53, says they feel “too old now,” adding that while they previously looked into adoption “the process seemed to be a nightmare, financially and otherwise.”\\n   \\n      “And it was such an emotionally (and financially) painful experience to try and fail, we couldn’t go through it again,” he adds, stressing that they have “no regrets.”\\n   \\n      “So we decided instead that we’d make our lives as interesting as possible.”\\n   \\n      Both acknowledge that one of the downsides of living in a different country for so long is that they don’t necessarily feel they belong anywhere.\\n   \\n      “We may never feel entirely at home in the US again, and we will never be truly accepted as Spanish,” admits Luban, noting that a “great way to learn about your country is to leave it.”\\n   \\n      “But Andalusia has taken us in, cared for us in a way we never could have imagined. Like interest on a bank account we never knew we had.”\\n  ',\n",

There goes Spain.’” admits Luban. “The next day, when I was released after I’d had surgery, a night there, my own room and two ambulance rides. They said, ‘Well, we need you to pay the bill. It’s 1,380 euros.’”\\n   \\n      He was particularly moved by the kindness shown by the local community, who dropped off food and constantly checked up on both of them.\\n   \\n      “In America, people would text you gift certificates and sad faces on the phone,” says Luban.\\n   \\n      “Here, people literally showed up at the door when Selena would be coming back from the hospital to give her a hug and tell her that they were going to be there. And they were there. For weeks.”\\n   \\n      While they’d initially planned to stay in Spain for a year, Luban and Medlen chose to extend their stay beyond this.\\n   \\n      The couple admit that watching Donald Trump being elected as president of the United States in November 2016 contributed to their decision to remain in Spain.\\n   \\n      “Once that happened, within a couple of months, our families were saying, ‘Don’t come back,’” says Luban, explaining that their relatives had been eager for them to return before the election result.\\n   \\n      “‘This country is changing. You really should just enjoy yourselves and not get caught up in all of the division that’s happening in the United States.’ That was just two months in.”\\n   \\n      Medlen points out that they both worked constantly while they were in the US, and felt as though they rarely got to spend time together, whereas they’ve been able to enjoy each other’s company a great deal more while living in Spain.\\n   \\n      Meanwhile, Luban’s health has improved during their time there, and he regularly rides with various local cycling groups. However, he says that he’s had his ups and downs “sleep-wise.”\\n   \\n      “The biggest thing is that we can manage our stress much better here,” he says. “When we’re not constantly worrying about our safety, money or whatever.”\\n   \\n      As they only had enough funds to cover a year living in Spain without working, the couple needed to start earning money again in order to extend their time there.\\n   \\n      Fortunately, Medlen was able to take on remote work for law firms in the US and Luban launched a website advising other practitioners on how to sell a medical practice.\\n   \\n      “I’d say we spend one fifth of what we would on food here, rather than California,” Luban estimates. “One eighth to one tenth on our living expenses. One eighth on health care.\\n   \\n      “And we had no idea how much your quality of life goes up when you’re not trying to meet all of those bills.”\\n   \\n      They both try to work around 20 hours a week, and say they’ve been able to live comfortably this way because their money goes much further in Spain.\\n   \\n      “We also have more time to cook, which brings your food bills down because you’re not buying takeout,” adds Medlen. “And we have more time to exercise. So I feel like we’re healthier.”\\n   \\n      Seven years after relocating to Ronda, the couple are very much settled, and even have a dog, named Lola Supernova.\\n   \\n      They say that they re-evaluate their decision each year, and weigh up whether they want to stay in Spain or move on.\\n   \\n      However, they’ve chosen not to buy a home there so that they have a little more freedom.\\n   \\n      “Wa take it to one year increments,” explains Medlen. “And we still rent our apartment that we live in.\\n   \\n      “We want to keep things simple and have flexibility so that we could change our minds and go somewhere else.”\\n   \\n      They return to the US every year and joke that they’re always shocked by how much a burrito at American food chain Chipotle is.\\n   \\n      “There’s been a lot of inflation since we left,” notes Medlen.\\n   \\n      While the couple still sometimes struggle with the prospect of not having children, Luban, now 53, says they feel “too old now,” adding that while they previously looked into adoption “the process seemed to be a nightmare, financially and otherwise.”\\n   \\n      “And it was such an emotionally (and financially) painful experience to try and fail, we couldn’t go through it again,” he adds, stressing that they have “no regrets.”\\n   \\n      “So we decided instead that we’d make our lives as interesting as possible.”\\n   \\n      Both acknowledge that one of the downsides of living in a different country for so long is that they don’t necessarily feel they belong anywhere.\\n   \\n      “We may never feel entirely at home in the US again, and we will never be truly accepted as Spanish,” admits Luban, noting that a “great way to learn about your country is to leave it.”\\n   \\n      “But Andalusia has taken us in, cared for us in a way we never could have imagined. Like interest on a bank account we never knew we had.”\\n  ',\n",

Dark tourism is predicated on a “preoccupation with death,” she said.\\n   \\n      “These are things that are part of being human,” said Slocum, who’s currently teaching a course on the subject. “(Cemeteries) celebrate community and the people buried there.”\\n   \\n      For the history-curious, cemeteries are rich resources. Tombstones themselves are monuments to the past and to the people buried beneath them, Neighbors said. Their design tells stories about the era in which they were produced — if it’s elaborate and well-kept, for example, it may mark the grave of a well-known and wealthy community member.\\n   \\n      Symbols on gravestones tell stories, too: In the 19th and 20th centuries, it was common for gravestones to bear symbols of religion or groups to which they belonged, like the Masonic square and compass. Children are often represented by lambs, Neighbors said, and some tombstones resemble trees from which limbs are cut, symbols of the deaths of family members.\\n   \\n      Even the birth and death dates can tell rich, devastating stories without words, she said.\\n   \\n      “It really makes you respect your heritage and the past,” Neighbors said.\\n   \\n      Many gravesites have become popular tourist destinations for their architecture, famous “residents” or historic significance: The Bonaventure Cemetery in Savannah, Georgia, is the Southern Gothic home to hundreds of Confederate soldiers and men who fought in the Spanish-American War, along with members of Savannah’s prominent 19th-century families. St. Mary Magdalene Churchyard in East Ham outside of London was a Roman burial site, discovered in the 19th century after hundreds of years of dormancy. And New Orleans’ St. Louis Cemetery No. 1 is home to dozens of locals who’ve since become urban legends, such as Voodoo queen Marie Laveau.\\n   \\n      “Cemeteries kind of have personalities,” Bible said. “They all have their own set of history and style — none of them are really the same experience.”\\n   \\n      In some places, Neighbors said, cemeteries function almost like parks: In Edinburgh, Scotland, the Greyfriars Kirkyard cemetery is open 24 hours a day, and people visit to knit, read, eat lunch and meet friends around its historic tombstones. (It’s also the home of the memorial for Greyfriars Bobby, a terrier who was said to have stood guard at his owner’s grave for 14 years.

       " {'headline': '\\n      Abandoned golf courses are being reclaimed by nature\\n    ',\n",
       "  'contents': ' \\n  Editor’s Note: Call to Earth is a CNN editorial series committed to reporting on the environmental challenges facing our planet, together with the solutions.\\xa0Rolex’s Perpetual Planet initiative\\xa0has partnered with CNN to drive awareness and education around key sustainability issues and to inspire positive action.\\n \\n      Golf courses, despite occupying large green spaces, are not necessarily good for the environment. Land is often cleared to make way for a fairway and maintaining the pristine turf often requires a lot of water, regular mowing and the spraying of fertilizers and pesticides – none of which is good for biodiversity.\\n   \\n      In the US, with the number of course closures outweighing new openings every year since 2006, some are questioning how we should use these huge spaces – and asking whether, instead of golf, nature should be left to run its course.\\n   \\n      Conservation nonprofits and local authorities are looking to acquire golf courses that have been abandoned due to high maintenance costs, low player numbers or other reasons, and repurpose them into landscapes that boost biodiversity and build natural defenses against climate change.\\n   \\n      These spaces provide “huge opportunities from a conservation perspective,” says Guillermo Rodriguez, California state director of The Trust for Public Land (TPL), a conservation organization which is rewilding three of the state’s former courses.\\n   \\n      “It’s a multiple win,” he continues. “You increase public access by taking former private golf courses (and) turning them into public properties … (you return) water back into rivers and streams and create a better habitat for the endangered species that we have in California.”\\n   \\n      Take San Geronimo, an 18-hole course in northern California’s Marin County, located on two waterways, which are home to endangered coho salmon and steelhead trout. Since the course’s construction in 1965, much of the water from San Geronimo and Larsen Creek was being diverted to provide irrigation for the course, affecting fish populations in the area, says Rodriguez.\\n   \\n      In 2018, TPL purchased the 157-acre site and began converting the area back into its natural state: turning off the irrigation, removing culverts and dams built to capture water and starting to restore the habitat by planting native species. According to TPL, the rewilding process could take up to 10 years, but\\xa0there are signs that wildlife is already bouncing back, with bobcats spotted roaming the area.\\n   \\n      Rodriguez admits that initially TPL’s plan received some strong opposition from the public, especially from the golfers. But after efforts to involve locals in the design and opening hiking and biking trails in the area attitudes are changing. Now known as San Geronimo Commons, the site is a thriving center for the local community, he says.\\n   \\n      Further down the coast in Santa Barbara is another of TPL’s acquisitions: Ocean Meadows. The nine-hole course was built in the 1960s on the site of a wetland. To create it, developers filled the plain with 500,000 cubic yards of soil.\\n   \\n      TPL purchased the 64-acre area in 2013 and started restoring the wetlands, removing the soil that had been added during construction and planting native vegetation. Since then, migratory birds have replaced birdies, and at least two pairs of threatened western snowy plovers are successfully breeding in the area’s mudflats.\\n   \\n      With the extreme shifts in weather patterns in recent years, especially in California, the benefits of having a wetland rather than a golf course have become clear, says Rodriguez. “Floodplains are able to kind of capture this water, protect infrastructure, protect other low-lying communities, and really let nature be an important solution,” he says.\\n   \\n      Most recently, TPL acquired Rancho Cañada, a 190-acre private golf course located in Monterey. It wants to widen and restore the riverbed and banks of the Carmel River, which runs through the course, helping to protect downstream neighborhoods from flooding.\\n   \\n      Crucially, the site will become part of a wider network of protected land, enabling a wildlife corridor from Ventana to Fort Ord. “The ability to remove fencing and create much more cohesion between the previous golf course and the surrounding public lands, really builds that connectivity back,” says Rodriguez.\\n   \\n      TPL is not the only organization on a mission to rewild golf courses. In Akron, Ohio, Summit Metro Parks acquired the 195-acre Valley View Golf Course in 2016, returning it to its natural state. In doing so it connected three local parks and created 1,900 contiguous acres of green space.\\n   \\n      The site has transformed, says Mike Johnson, chief of conservation at the nonprofit. Today, 90% of the vegetation is native, whereas the same percentage was non-native or invasive when it was a golf course, he says.\\n   \\n      “Golf courses are harsh environments, and to create them the vegetation used is usually non-native … It doesn’t have value for our local fish and wildlife,” he tells CNN.\\n   \\n      “We had to undo the golf course before we could restore the landscape,” he says, adding that they removed the levees, allowing the rivers and streams to run freely, and stripped out the turf and non-native trees before establishing a native cover of vegetation.\\n   \\n      “The response from wildlife has been huge,” he adds. “Prior to our work, we documented about 200 species of plant and wildlife that were living on the golf course at the time we acquired it. Today we have documented over 900 species of fish and wildlife that have returned to this area.”\\n   \\n      Across the pond, in the UK, a similar movement is underway. Frodsham golf course in Cheshire, where top Liverpool footballers like Michael Owen once teed off, was bought by the UK’s Woodland Trust last year, with the plan to plant 40,000 native trees on the site.\\n   \\n      “It’s still too soon to report any significant changes, but this summer more wildflowers were growing across the site because the fairways, greens, tees were not being mown as they would have been when it was being managed as a golf course,” says Neil Oxley, site manager for the Woodland Trust.\\n   \\n      The site will contribute to The Northern Forest scheme, an effort to plant 50 million trees across 10,000 square miles stretching coast to coast from Liverpool to Hull. Currently, the area only has 7.6% woodland cover, but the initiative hopes to increase this to 20%.\\n \\n      In other areas of the country, local councils are repurposing unprofitable municipal golf courses to create more natural spaces. Erewash Borough Council is working with Derbyshire Wildlife Trust to turn the Pewit golf course into a nature reserve, after noting that few people were using it and it was a substantial drain on the council’s resources.

       "  'contents': ' \\n  Editor’s Note: Call to Earth is a CNN editorial series committed to reporting on the environmental challenges facing our planet, together with the solutions.\\xa0Rolex’s Perpetual Planet initiative\\xa0has partnered with CNN to drive awareness and education around key sustainability issues and to inspire positive action.\\n \\n      Golf courses, despite occupying large green spaces, are not necessarily good for the environment. Land is often cleared to make way for a fairway and maintaining the pristine turf often requires a lot of water, regular mowing and the spraying of fertilizers and pesticides – none of which is good for biodiversity.\\n   \\n      In the US, with the number of course closures outweighing new openings every year since 2006, some are questioning how we should use these huge spaces – and asking whether, instead of golf, nature should be left to run its course.\\n   \\n      Conservation nonprofits and local authorities are looking to acquire golf courses that have been abandoned due to high maintenance costs, low player numbers or other reasons, and repurpose them into landscapes that boost biodiversity and build natural defenses against climate change.\\n   \\n      These spaces provide “huge opportunities from a conservation perspective,” says Guillermo Rodriguez, California state director of The Trust for Public Land (TPL), a conservation organization which is rewilding three of the state’s former courses.\\n   \\n      “It’s a multiple win,” he continues. “You increase public access by taking former private golf courses (and) turning them into public properties … (you return) water back into rivers and streams and create a better habitat for the endangered species that we have in California.”\\n   \\n      Take San Geronimo, an 18-hole course in northern California’s Marin County, located on two waterways, which are home to endangered coho salmon and steelhead trout. Since the course’s construction in 1965, much of the water from San Geronimo and Larsen Creek was being diverted to provide irrigation for the course, affecting fish populations in the area, says Rodriguez.\\n   \\n      In 2018, TPL purchased the 157-acre site and began converting the area back into its natural state: turning off the irrigation, removing culverts and dams built to capture water and starting to restore the habitat by planting native species. According to TPL, the rewilding process could take up to 10 years, but\\xa0there are signs that wildlife is already bouncing back, with bobcats spotted roaming the area.\\n   \\n      Rodriguez admits that initially TPL’s plan received some strong opposition from the public, especially from the golfers. But after efforts to involve locals in the design and opening hiking and biking trails in the area attitudes are changing. Now known as San Geronimo Commons, the site is a thriving center for the local community, he says.\\n   \\n      Further down the coast in Santa Barbara is another of TPL’s acquisitions: Ocean Meadows. The nine-hole course was built in the 1960s on the site of a wetland. To create it, developers filled the plain with 500,000 cubic yards of soil.\\n   \\n      TPL purchased the 64-acre area in 2013 and started restoring the wetlands, removing the soil that had been added during construction and planting native vegetation. Since then, migratory birds have replaced birdies, and at least two pairs of threatened western snowy plovers are successfully breeding in the area’s mudflats.\\n   \\n      With the extreme shifts in weather patterns in recent years, especially in California, the benefits of having a wetland rather than a golf course have become clear, says Rodriguez. “Floodplains are able to kind of capture this water, protect infrastructure, protect other low-lying communities, and really let nature be an important solution,” he says.\\n   \\n      Most recently, TPL acquired Rancho Cañada, a 190-acre private golf course located in Monterey. It wants to widen and restore the riverbed and banks of the Carmel River, which runs through the course, helping to protect downstream neighborhoods from flooding.\\n   \\n      Crucially, the site will become part of a wider network of protected land, enabling a wildlife corridor from Ventana to Fort Ord. “The ability to remove fencing and create much more cohesion between the previous golf course and the surrounding public lands, really builds that connectivity back,” says Rodriguez.\\n   \\n      TPL is not the only organization on a mission to rewild golf courses. In Akron, Ohio, Summit Metro Parks acquired the 195-acre Valley View Golf Course in 2016, returning it to its natural state. In doing so it connected three local parks and created 1,900 contiguous acres of green space.\\n   \\n      The site has transformed, says Mike Johnson, chief of conservation at the nonprofit. Today, 90% of the vegetation is native, whereas the same percentage was non-native or invasive when it was a golf course, he says.\\n   \\n      “Golf courses are harsh environments, and to create them the vegetation used is usually non-native … It doesn’t have value for our local fish and wildlife,” he tells CNN.\\n   \\n      “We had to undo the golf course before we could restore the landscape,” he says, adding that they removed the levees, allowing the rivers and streams to run freely, and stripped out the turf and non-native trees before establishing a native cover of vegetation.\\n   \\n      “The response from wildlife has been huge,” he adds. “Prior to our work, we documented about 200 species of plant and wildlife that were living on the golf course at the time we acquired it. Today we have documented over 900 species of fish and wildlife that have returned to this area.”\\n   \\n      Across the pond, in the UK, a similar movement is underway. Frodsham golf course in Cheshire, where top Liverpool footballers like Michael Owen once teed off, was bought by the UK’s Woodland Trust last year, with the plan to plant 40,000 native trees on the site.\\n   \\n      “It’s still too soon to report any significant changes, but this summer more wildflowers were growing across the site because the fairways, greens, tees were not being mown as they would have been when it was being managed as a golf course,” says Neil Oxley, site manager for the Woodland Trust.\\n   \\n      The site will contribute to The Northern Forest scheme, an effort to plant 50 million trees across 10,000 square miles stretching coast to coast from Liverpool to Hull. Currently, the area only has 7.6% woodland cover, but the initiative hopes to increase this to 20%.\\n \\n      In other areas of the country, local councils are repurposing unprofitable municipal golf courses to create more natural spaces. Erewash Borough Council is working with Derbyshire Wildlife Trust to turn the Pewit golf course into a nature reserve, after noting that few people were using it and it was a substantial drain on the council’s resources. Brighton and Hove City Council is rewilding the 220-acre Waterhall course to restore the area’s chalk grasslands.\\n   \\n      In the Melbourne suburb of Elwood, Elsternwick Park golf course has been transformed into a natural oasis, providing respite from the city both for wildlife and the local community.\\n   \\n      Bayside City Council, which decided to repurpose the course upon expiration of its lease, came up with a plan to create different habitats, from open water and swamp scrub to wetlands and woodland, that support a range of species.

       "  'contents': ' \\nEditor’s note: Dana Santas, known as the “Mobility Maker,” is a certified strength and conditioning specialist and mind-body coach in professional sports, and is the author of the book “Practical Solutions for Back Pain Relief.”\\n \\n      As the seasons change so do some of your inside and outside chores, especially if you live in a four-season climate. For those in the northern United States, heading into autumn usually means raking leaves, packing up summer clothes, and pulling coats and other warmer clothes out of storage.\\n   \\n      Regardless of climate, many people decorate their homes and landscapes for fall and the upcoming holidays, so lugging boxed decorations out of storage and spending time decorating are on many folks’ seasonal agendas.\\n   \\n      What a lot of people don’t realize is that those seasonal chores are functional exercises that can burn more calories than some traditional fitness activities. In fact, raking leaves can burn more calories in an hour than a brisk walk or weight training session.\\n   \\n      What’s more, because seasonal chores, like raking, are considered moderate-intensity cardiovascular exercise, time spent preparing for the fall season counts toward the recommended 150 minutes of moderate exercise per week.\\n   \\n      According to the physical activity calorie calculator on the American Council on Exercise’s website, a person with a body weight of 170 pounds (77 kilograms) would burn 308 calories doing an hour of yard work, such as raking. Comparatively, walking briskly at a pace of 3.5 miles per hour burns only 293 calories for that same 170-pound person. For those focused on indoor seasonal chores, using the same body-weight metric, an hour of housework at 231 calories is the equivalent of an hour of basic weight training.\\n   \\n      The calculator gives you an idea of potential caloric burn, but keep in mind that these numbers are only estimations since your individual metabolism in any exercise session is influenced by many factors, including age, biological sex, body composition, fitness level and intensity of effort. Using a wearable fitness tracker that includes this personal information in its calculation will give a more accurate, individualized number.\\n   \\n      When you go to the gym to work out, you carefully consider the weights you use and the time you spend exercising. You also gauge the overall demands on your body versus your fitness level and what you believe you are actually capable of doing. For instance, if you have only ever used 10-pound dumbbells for overhead pressing, you would know better than to switch suddenly to 50 pounds because you would likely hurt yourself.\\n   \\n      Unfortunately, too many people forget to use that mindset when doing seasonal chores. Some look at the task at hand as simply needing to be done and just do it — or attempt to — without considering their own potential limitations, prepping their bodies for the demands of the task, and keeping in mind proper form and other factors while executing the chore. This lack of awareness can easily lead to injury.\\n   \\n      To maximize your fitness benefits and lower your risk of injury, follow the tips below:\\n   \\n      With any form of exercise, it’s important to prepare for the associated movements and effort. Take a few moments to move your body in all directions and planes of motion while raising your heart rate. Begin with some gentle stretching and progress to movements such as arm circles, walking lunges, lateral lunges, jumping jacks, jogging in place and other similar warm-up exercises.\\n   \\n      Just as you would execute an exercise at the gym, you want to perform your seasonal chores with the same attention to proper form. Lifting should be done by bending your knees and using your legs as your main source of power. Stay aware of your balance and maintain stability with a hip-distance or a slightly wider, even stance during most tasks. Whenever you’re twisting, as you would when raking or shoveling, focus on rotating from the middle of your back — never your lower back — to avoid strains.\\n   \\n      Because most humans have a dominant side, we tend to favor that side while doing chores. But doing an hour of sided work, especially seasonal work that you don’t commonly do, could lead to significant muscle soreness and overuse injury. That’s why it’s best to switch sides every few minutes. It may feel awkward and slow you down a bit to use your nondominant side, but hurting later will feel much worse and slow you down even more.\\n   \\n      Be realistic about the tasks you are trying to accomplish. As with the earlier example of not using weights that you know you couldn’t lift, don’t risk injury by trying to do the impossible. Get someone to help with any heavy lifting beyond your capability, break up larger tasks into smaller ones and take breaks as needed.\\n   \\n      Remember that an adult body is composed of up to 60% water. Even in cooler temperatures outside, we lose fluid through our sweat. That’s why it’s critical to take water breaks during your chores and keep hydrated after you’re done with your work.\\n   \\n      Because your seasonal work may be less familiar to your body, there is a good chance you will feel sore afterward, having worked muscles in different ways than your normal routine. To lessen the chance of significant soreness, take a few minutes to stretch and breathe after you complete your chores. And then give your body some much-needed recovery by taking time to rest and put your feet up, eat a healthy, satiating meal and get enough sleep.\\n   \\n      By following the guidelines above, you can safely maximize the benefits of fall seasonal tasks, getting your house, yard and body in shape for the upcoming holidays.\\n  ',\n",

       "  'contents': ' \\nEditor’s note: Mehdi Barakchian is a New York-born actor, comedian and producer who has appeared in numerous screen productions. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. Read more opinion on CNN.\\xa0\\n \\n      Earlier this month, striking writers ratified a deal with major Hollywood studios that was greeted with excitement throughout the entertainment community. In a year of multiple strikes, it represented a major win for workers fighting growing income inequality.\\n   \\n      Now, it’s the actors’ turn to reach a deal with studios — except that the studios have suspended talks with SAG-AFTRA, the union representing us.\\n   \\n      The Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP) walked away from the bargaining table on October 11 and studio executives said they were suspending discussions because they were “no longer moving” forward “in a productive direction.” In short, the actors and studios remain in a stalemate.\\n   \\n      In case you haven’t followed the actors’ strike, the AMPTP and SAG-AFTRA are negotiating revenue sharing and policies around use of artificial intelligence (AI), among other items. Until we get a deal, actors like me remain on the picket lines. And as long as we’re on the picket lines, a lot of great shows won’t be filmed, and a lot of folks who rely on this industry will be out of work.\\n   \\n      Maybe you’re thinking “wait, I thought actors make tons of money?” Well, sure, it can be millions and millions of dollars — if you’re an A-lister. Most of us don’t come anywhere close.\\n   \\n      In my case, you may not know my name, but you might recognize my kind-of-familiar face from one of the shows I’ve appeared in. Some have been pretty big hits over the last five years, including the supernatural drama series “Manifest,” the psychological thriller series “You,” and “Modern Love,” an anthology series about human connection.\\n   \\n      I’m fortunate to have enough success acting full time that I’ve been able to pay my bills and acquire health insurance. Back when my bookings were really booming, I proposed to my now wife and added a dog to our family — the typical sorts of things people do when they have financial stability.\\n   \\n      But it’s never been easy for the average actor to afford the conventional trappings of middle-class life — and it’s getting harder all the time. One big problem for actors is that the business model for Hollywood film productions has completely changed, but the contracts have not. That’s why actors went out on strike in July, a couple of months after the writers did.\\n   \\n      Suffice to say, my not working for the past few months has been a financial hardship on my family. But the roughly 160,000 actors on strike are enduring what we hope to be a short-term pain for long term gains in pay, benefits and job protection. We miss the profession that we love, but we can’t continue to work in conditions that compensate us less than our due and in an industry that fails to safeguard our careers as it embraces AI in a way that potentially could threaten our livelihoods.\\n   \\n      A lot of Hollywood’s biggest stars are on the picket lines too, lending us their moral support, for which I’m grateful. They are fighting with us for fair wages in an industry where the average salary in 2022 was a paltry $27.73 per hour for actors in California, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. But most actors don’t work a 40-hour work week, 12 months a year, so those stats may not fully capture just how precarious our livelihood is.\\n   \\n      Acting is a notoriously tough profession to break into and maintain long-term security. Most of us who could were likely able to make a living did so because we were paid a fair wage based on viewership.\\n   \\n      Prior to the advent of streaming, actors like me relied on residuals paid out based on how often we appeared in a show and how successful it was. That meant essentially, the more views, the more money we earned.\\n   \\n      But the contracts we are operating under do not consider the dramatic increase in streaming numbers and the decline of network and cable viewership. In short, actors work much more to make ends meet and still sometimes find ourselves earning less.\\n   \\n      When streaming first showed up, it had a lot of work to do to draw and maintain audiences. At the time, most of us were working in cable and network TV, which is where the audiences were. That large viewership, and the usage residuals this model provided, is why a lot of us were able to make a living. But the business has completely changed.\\n   \\n      Last year, streaming in the US surpassed cable and network TV in viewership. Many actors depend on residuals from previous programs but in the streaming era, that income has fallen precipitously.\\n \\n      This immense shift has changed the model, and the AMPTP, which represents movie and television producers, including Disney, Warner Brothers and Netflix (CNN’s parent company is Warner Bros. Discovery, which produces movies and television shows.) And even as studios say that they’re being squeezed financially, CEOs continue to earn tens of millions of dollars.\\n   \\n      Meanwhile, SAG-AFTRA says 86% of its members don’t qualify for health care coverage through the union, because they don’t qualify under SAG-AFTRA’s income threshold, which is about $26,500 a year.\\n   \\n      What’s more, many of us live in the most expensive cities in the country like Los Angeles and New York, because that’s where the work and industry infrastructure exists. The average one-bedroom apartment in Los Angeles rents for about $3,000 per month, according to rent.com, which comes to $36,000 per year. So, if you’re a Hollywood actor barely scraping by — well, you can do the math.\\n   \\n      Another major sticking point is how the industry would like to use AI. The AI proposal from the AMPTP impacts the most marginalized and financially vulnerable performers in the entertainment industry — background actors.\\n   \\n      Obviously, the way in which actors’ images will be used is a hugely important issue. SAG-AFTRA negotiators say the proposed contract would pay background actors for a day’s work (they currently are paid at the rate of less than $200 per day), scan their body and use that image any way they want for the rest of the project. The union has also said that the studios want to own that scan to use for perpetuity, without the consent of the background actor and without providing further compensation. The AMPTP rejected this claim, and has said that they will require consent from the actor and the replica would only be used in the movie they signed up for.\\n   \\n      But here’s a sobering thought: AI technology is still incredibly young. We have no way of understanding or knowing what can be done with this information in 10, 20, or 30 years. The potential is limitless and protections for real people need to be put in place now.\\n   \\n      You might be thinking, “With all your reservations about the way the business of Hollywood is run, why don’t you just get a different job?” I’d turn the question around and ask you, “Wouldn’t you fight for the job you love?”\\n   \\n      Acting is my job. It’s more than that – it’s my passion. I’ve done thousands of auditions, performed thousands of hours on stage to hone my craft, finished hundreds of hours of really mediocre improv classes (and some good ones too) and made a cross-country move away from everyone and everything I know to pursue this career.\\n   \\n      I think a lot of people were reminded of the value of on-screen entertainment in their lives during the Covid-19 pandemic. The stories we watched on big and small screens gave us something else to talk about — a way to escape the scary reality just outside our front door.\\n   \\n      Several Hollywood A-listers, including Ben Affleck, Emma Stone and George Clooney, met with SAG-AFTRA leaders this week after the studios suspended negotiations. They’ve made overtures to try to end the strike, according to news reports; I’m hoping that all that star power helps get the talks back on track. The idea that underpaid union workers should “get a different job” while industry executives earn tens of millions of dollars feels like a post-apocalyptic show written by AI. But here we are — in real life.\\n   \\n      Let’s be clear: this fight is about the entire ecosystem that makes your favorite onscreen entertainment run. This includes actors like me, but also casting directors, costume departments, lighting crews, camera operators, producers, teamsters, make-up artists and so many more professionals with real lives, real families and real professional goals. None of us non-executives\\xa0 get rich working in this industry.\\n   \\n      I couldn’t be happier for my extended family in the Writers Guild of America whose sacrifice and determination allowed them to strike a deal with the studio execs that their leaders are happy with. Until the actors can say the same, you won’t find my kind-of-familiar face on screen, but on the picket line.\\n  ',\n",

You can listen to an audio version of the newsletter by clicking the same link.\\n \\n      The Commerce Department is set to report third-quarter gross domestic product Thursday. It’s the broadest measure of economic output, and it’ll likely show that the US economy expanded at a staggeringly rapid pace from July through September, despite higher interest rates, depleted pandemic savings and high inflation.\\n   \\n      The economy is expected to keep growing through the end of the year, though at a slower rate. Some investors say an end-of-year stock rally may be on the table, too. \\n   \\n      The expectation that the economy won’t pick up even more strength may keep the Federal Reserve on track to cutting rates sometime in 2024, since red-hot demand outpacing supply could be maintaining some upward pressure on prices. But how early in the year the Fed begins to cut rates ultimately depends on inflation’s trajectory.\\n   \\n      Fed Chair Jerome Powell has said the central bank needs to see “below-trend growth” to be assured that inflation is on track to slow to 2%, the Fed’s inflation target.\\n   \\n      “The US economy continued to show remarkable resilience over the summer with surprisingly robust job growth and an unexpected consumer spending spree that likely propelled real GDP growth above 5% annualized in (the third quarter),” Gregory Daco, chief economist at EY-Parthenon, wrote in an analyst note. \\n   \\n      “While these signs of economic strength will fuel speculations that the economy is re-accelerating, we do not expect such strong momentum will be sustained.”\\n   \\n      The Fed cuts interest rates whenever unemployment rises sharply or if inflation consistently hovers below 2%. The central bank also doesn’t have any incentive to restrict the economy through elevated interest rates if inflation is already under control. \\n   \\n      Daco expects rate cuts to begin by the middle of next year. \\n   \\n      The Fed’s main strategy to defeat inflation is by slowing demand through rate increases, since higher interest rates make borrowing to purchase cars and homes more expensive, thus prompting consumers to curb their spending. The US central bank has raised interest rates 11 times since March 2022 to their highest level in 22 years.\\n   \\n      Still, the economy seems to have powered through in the third quarter.\\n   \\n      Consumer spending, which accounts for about 70% of economic output, advanced a healthy 0.4% in August, following a 0.7% gain in July. Retail sales, a component of the broader spending figures, grew for the sixth-straight month in September. Meanwhile, industrial production rose in September to its highest level in nearly five years. \\n   \\n      And employers have added about 260,000 jobs a month this year, on average, totaling more than 2 million jobs added since January. A strong job market begets similarly strong spending.\\n   \\n      But to be sure, Americans are still facing several economic obstacles. Soaring Treasury yields are expected to cool the economy, on top of tougher lending standards, the resumption of student-loan repayments, and the exhausted excess savings that many Americans had accumulated during the pandemic. \\n   \\n      The US economy is also contending with two foreign wars, trillions in federal debt, a frozen housing market, and record-low oil inventory, right as geopolitical tensions in the Middle East threaten a spike in oil prices. \\n   \\n      Yet even though uncertainty abounds, some economists maintain a bullish outlook on the economy’s resilience.\\n   \\n      “The rise in bond yields and lags in credit tightening, including effect on corporate debt issued earlier in the pandemic set to reprice at much higher rates, are expected to be headwinds in 2024,” Diane Swonk, chief economist at KPMG, wrote in a post on X, formerly Twitter. \\n   \\n      “That can have a slowdown without fully derailing the economy,” she said.\\n   \\n      From ESG investing (BlackRock) and gay rights (Disney) to Donald Trump after the Capitol riots (mainstream corporate America), companies routinely take a stand on cultural issues. \\n   \\n      Sometimes their stance helps their bottom line, as it did with Nike, after the company supported Colin Kaepernick’s right to kneel during the national anthem in protest against the poor treatment of Black Americans by the police. Sometimes, it does the opposite — think Bud Light’s support of transgender rights, reports my colleague Elliott Gotkine.\\n   \\n      Most companies had avoided wading into the long-running Israeli-Palestinian conflict, but when the barbarous scale of Hamas’s October 7 attacks on Israel became clear, staying silent ceased to be an option, according to some management experts and others in the corporate community.\\n   \\n      “Saying nothing speaks to cowardice,” said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a professor at the Yale School of Management who focuses on corporate leadership among other issues. “They’ll have a hard time celebrating their corporate character and what they stand for if they sit mutely on the sidelines.”\\n   \\n      With that in mind, many companies have rallied in support of Israel. Microsoft (MSFT) CEO Satya Nadella said he was “heartbroken by the horrific terrorist attacks on Israel.” Sundar Pichai, his counterpart at Alphabet (GOOG), was “deeply saddened.” Disney (DIS) donated $2 million in humanitarian relief to Israel, and banks have contributed millions, too. \\n   \\n      All in, around 80 household-name companies in the United States have condemned the Hamas attacks, according to a list compiled by Sonnenfeld.   \\n   \\n      Many organizations, though, have opted for a more cautious approach, especially those outside the United States. In the United Kingdom, London-based football club Tottenham Hotspur, who are known for their large number of Jewish supporters, faced criticism for just saying the club was “\\u200b\\u200bshocked and saddened by the escalating crisis in Israel and Gaza.” \\n   \\nMonday: Earnings from Whirlpool.\\n   \\nTuesday: Earnings from Coca-Cola, Verizon, General Electric, Barclays, 3M, Sherwin-Williams, Kimberly-Clark, General Motors, Haliburton, Spotify, Quest Diagnostics, Microsoft, Alphabet, Visa, and Snap.\\n   \\nWednesday: Earnings from T-Mobile, Boeing, General Dynamics, Moody’s, Hess, Old Dominion, Hilton, Meta, and IBM.

       " {'headline': '\\n      After a summer of Barbenheimer and Beyoncé, can US consumers still afford the holiday season?\\n    ',\n",
       "  'contents': ' \\n      Ballpark attendance boomed this summer, Barbenheimer revived the box office and a Renaissance of live performances brought concerts into new Eras.\\n   \\n      In mid-2023, Americans’ enduring efforts to satisfy post-pandemic cravings for experiences hit a fever pitch.\\n   \\n      “Everybody went out on tour,” said Keith Gentili, a 55-year-old New Hampshire resident who saw 13 shows this summer, a total that surpassed what he’d see in an entire year pre-pandemic. “It was like a buffet. The buffet was open.”\\n   \\n      Consumer spending this year remained strong despite high inflation and rising interest rates. \\n   \\n      But after the summer of splurge, some economists and consumer analysts anticipate that those and other pressures could cause that resilience to buckle — perhaps meaningfully so — during the critical holiday season. \\n   \\n      However, it also could mean that holiday spending just might look a little different and skewed more toward experiences than it has done in past years.\\n   \\n      “I think that, rationally, you would expect there would be some sort of consumer pullback, but then again, we’re seeing so many conflicting signs right now,” said Ted Rossman, senior industry analyst at Bankrate. “We see people spending aggressively on experiences like travel and dining and concerts and sporting events, and that’s not normally what we would see when people get nervous about the state of the economy.”\\n   \\n      He added: “But I think it shows that right now is not a normal time; I think we still have this pent-up demand from the pandemic, and I think a lot of people are saying, ‘You know what? You only live once, and I’m going to do it anyway.’”\\n   \\n      Consumers aren’t expected to pull back entirely this holiday season, and some early surveys indicate that spending will not only be up from last year, but also possibly even higher than levels seen pre-pandemic. \\n   \\n      Respondents to KPMG’s 2023 holiday survey said they plan to spend 5% more this season, said Matt Kramer, KPMG’s consumer and retail national sector leader. \\n   \\n      Discretionary categories such as restaurants, apparel and travel are expected to benefit from people spending less on essentials, which are less expensive because of lower inflation, he said. \\n   \\n      “What stands out the most is this ‘leaning in’ to holiday travel and wanting to have those experiences with friends and family,” he said.\\n   \\n      As broader economic uncertainty grows and consumer sentiment falters, shoppers are expected to be more deal-seeking and price-conscious this season than last year, said Tamara Charm, who heads McKinsey & Company’s consumer insights hub. \\n   \\n      But they’re still going to spend, she said. \\n   \\n      “Our most recent [Consumer Pulse research] measure was that 79% of folks are still trading down,” she said. “And then consumers are also still saying they’re going to splurge, especially higher-income and younger consumers. But the splurge seems to be going to experiences, to travel to out-of-home entertainment, fitness and then also self-care.”\\n   \\n      Consumers closed out the summer with a bang, according to the Commerce Department’s latest retail sales report released earlier this week.\\n   \\n      US retail sales rose 0.7% in September from August, marking the sixth month in a row of growth, according to data that’s adjusted for seasonality but not inflation. \\n   \\n      And in September, that inflation didn’t have an outsized affect on the sales growth, considering the Consumer Price Index for September rose 0.4% on a monthly basis, and goods prices were up only 0.1%.\\n   \\n      However, while the monthly retail sales reports can provide a window into how much Americans’ appetites for goods are growing or waning, they show only part of the consumer spending picture. Aside from sales captured at some restaurants and bars, sales at services-related industries are excluded. \\n   \\n      A more comprehensive look at consumer spending will come at the tail end of the month when the Personal Consumption Expenditures data is released.\\n   \\n      Consumer spending is expected to slow in the coming months but not fizzle out completely, said Gus Faucher, senior vice president and chief economist at the PNC Financial Services Group. \\n   \\n      “There are still some positives: Households still have money saved up, consumer debt burdens are low,” he said, noting that while job growth has slowed considerably from their red-hot pace of the past three years, “it’s still solid job growth.”\\n   \\n      But there’s also plenty of bifurcation occurring in what’s been a post-Covid K-shaped recovery with the wealthiest households having rebounded more strongly than lower-income Americans. \\n   \\n      “Our feeling is that any extra savings that remain are skewed toward upper-income households,” said Nancy Vanden Houten, Oxford Economics’ senior economist. “We think that lower-income households are going to have a harder time maintaining spending.”\\n   \\n      That especially includes Americans who face financial pressures from student loan payments resuming, rising debt, dwindling savings, and high interest rates, she added.\\n   \\n      Additionally, delinquencies are also rising, but are mostly back to pre-pandemic levels; the labor market is slowly becoming less robust; and the geopolitical outlook has grown even more uncertain. \\n   \\n      The growing list of complicating — and potentially culminating — factors are more than mere stumbling blocks to the average American household that has minimal wiggle room in that monthly budget. \\n   \\n      “The economic data has been better than a lot of us expected,” Rossman said. “But I think there are starting to be more and more cracks in the foundation, and that tends to be the most evident among people with lower incomes and lower credit scores.”\\n   \\n      He added: “They’re kind of the canaries in the coal mine.”\\n   \\n      Credit card delinquencies are noticeably worse among people with lower credit scores, he said, noting that subprime auto delinquencies are worse now than they were during the financial crisis of 2007-2009.\\n   \\n      “A lot of folks feel comfortable today, but it wouldn’t necessarily take a whole lot to push them into a situation where they don’t feel all that comfortable,” said Matt Schulz, chief credit analyst with LendingTree. \\n   \\n      For some people, that may be the student loan payment restarting; for others, it may be a job loss or an unexpected medical expense. Every person’s situation is different, but sometimes it doesn’t take much for a comfortable situation to turn dicey, he said. \\n   \\n      “As well as people have generally handled their business over the last couple of years, there comes a point where the headwinds that they face and the challenges that they’re up against become too much,” he said.\\n  ',\n",

       " {'headline': '\\n      Why the housing market is going from tough to terrible\\n    ',\n",
       "  'contents': ' \\n      Mortgage rates are nearing 8%. Prices have climbed for the past three months straight. And there were fewer homes on the market in September than any September ever. No wonder home sales just hit a 13-year low. It is a crummy time to try to buy a house.\\n   \\n      In unwelcome news to homebuyers, none of this is expected to change soon. Prices are expected to stay high, inventory is expected to stay low and rates may climb even further.\\n   \\n      The current housing market offers a crushing affordability picture for would-be-homebuyers and is keeping many out of the market. And it has been steadily worsening for the past two years.\\n   \\n      With the average 30-year fixed rate loan currently at 7.63%, according to Freddie Mac, it now requires a monthly principal and interest payment of $2,528 to afford a median-priced home with a 20% down payment, according to ICE Mortgage Technology, which recently acquired mortgage data provider Black Knight. \\n   \\n      That is up 91% from two years ago and an increase of $1,204 a month, ICE found.\\n   \\n      The monthly payment on an average-priced home now requires 40% of the median household income, making housing the least affordable it’s been since 1984, according to ICE.\\n   \\n      “The last time home affordability was this tight, interest rates were at 13.6% — roughly 6 points higher than today — and the average home price was about 3.5 times the median household income,” said Andy Walden, vice president of enterprise research at ICE Mortgage Technology. “Today, after years of low interest rates helping to drive purchase prices up, the average home costs six times the median income.”\\n   \\n      To bring affordability back to long-term averages, he said, it would take some combination of up to a 37% decline in home prices, mortgage rates dropping by 4 percentage points, or a 60% growth in median household incomes. \\n   \\n      “Unfortunately, the upward shift in Treasury yields this week will likely make returning to ‘normal’ an even more challenging target to hit,” Walden said.\\n   \\n      Inflation is still above the Fed’s stated target of 2%, which means the central bank’s benchmark rate will likely stay higher for longer.\\n   \\n      Ahead of the central bank’s upcoming two-day policy meeting, which starts on October 31, financial markets are pricing in another pause on rate hikes. But the chances of an additional pause in December are much lower, at around 61%, according to the CME FedWatch Tool.\\n   \\n      “Longer term Treasury yields — which mortgage rates tend to follow — depend on expected economic growth and inflation expectations,” said Orphe Divounguy, senior economist at Zillow. “Inflation expectations are moving higher. Political dysfunction in the nation’s capital and rising government borrowing are also likely contributing to the increased pressure on yields.” \\n   \\n      But even if mortgage rates do reach 8%, it wouldn’t make things that much worse for buyers, said Nicole Bachaud, senior economist at Zillow, partly because the market is already so unaffordable.\\n   \\n      A buyer making the median household income and putting a 10% down payment on a typical home in August would have spent almost 40% of their income on their mortgage payments. To get that down to the recommended 30%, which is a standard threshold commonly used as a guideline for an affordable home, a household would need an annual income of almost $107,000, according to Zillow. The median household income was $74,580 in 2022, according to the US Census Bureau.\\n   \\n      If mortgage rates rise to 8%, Bachaud said, the income needed to afford the typical US home would rise to nearly $114,000. \\n   \\n      “Buyers are already in a tight spot and the housing market isn’t likely to look markedly different with rates above 8%,” she said.\\n   \\n      But with a strong labor market and Fed rate cuts pushed out into, perhaps, the third quarter of 2024, the market could stay at this level for a while, said John Toohig, head of whole loan trading at Raymond James.\\n   \\n      So how long can home prices stay strong? And how much longer can would-be homeowners keep putting off buying a home?\\n   \\n      “For much of this year I’ve hunted for good news as to how we will endure ‘higher for longer’ but not see the world break,” Toohig said. \\n   \\n      “An aggressive Fed that is prone to overcorrecting can do real damage,” he said. “Good news in the economy causes rates to stay higher for longer — but the longer rates are higher, the more likely something in the market goes ‘boom.’”\\n  ',\n",

       " {'headline': '\\n      Why this American couple swapped California for Spain\\n    ',\n",
       "  'contents': ' \\n      After a number of failed IVF rounds, health issues and the death of their beloved dog, US couple Jason Luban and Selena Medlen were in need of a change of scenery.\\n   \\n      The couple, then based in Oakland, California, had penciled in a trip to Andalusia, Spain, months before, but were unsure whether to go ahead with it when the health of Luban, who has torsion dystonia, a rare movement disorder, began to deteriorate.\\n   \\n      “We were figuring out how to get him healthy again,” Medlen tells CNN Travel, before explaining that Luban was also grieving the loss of a friend and mentor. “So we had this vacation on the books, and we weren’t sure if he could travel.”\\n   \\n      According to Medlen, they ultimately decided to “go for it” after Luban, who suffers from insomnia, began sleeping better.\\n   \\n      “We thought, maybe we needed a break,” adds Medlen, who was working as an attorney at the time. “That if we could get away from everything, maybe he would start to feel better.”\\n   \\n      A friend had recommended that the pair, married since 2009, spend some time in Ronda, a town located in Spain’s Malaga province, so they decided to book two nights there.\\n   \\n      But neither could have predicted that they’d end up packing up their lives and relocating there just a few months later.\\n   \\n      In May 2016, they flew into Madrid, spending some time in the capital city, as well as Toledo, Cordoba and Seville, before heading to Ronda.\\n   \\n      “As we left Seville for Ronda, something shifted,” says Luban, an acupuncturist. “The land. The energy. “All [of] the plants were blooming.\\n   \\n      “There were all these colors everywhere. And we were both just in shock at how gorgeous it was as we kept climbing and climbing in the car.”\\n   \\n      When they reached the town, they were greeted by a parade, which set the tone for the rest of the weekend.\\n   \\n      The pair celebrated Medlen’s 38th birthday in Ronda, and say they were struck by how friendly everyone was.\\n   \\n      “Everything kind of came together for just a day or two while we were here,” says Luban, who is originally from Oregon while Medlen is from Texas.\\n   \\n      After wrapping up their time in the pretty town, they went on to visit Granada before returning to the US. But Ronda stayed with them.\\n   \\n      “We went back to our lives, which we realized really sucked compared to what our experience was here [in Ronda,]” admits Luban, before explaining that his insomnia returned once they were back in the US.\\n   \\n      “Also, we both had, unbeknownst to one another, looked in the windows of real estate offices to see what the rental prices were here [in Ronda]. And it was a tenth of what we were paying in California.”\\n   \\n      While lying on the couch one day and reflecting on their fertility struggles, they began discussing what they would want for their lives if they weren’t ever able to have children.\\n   \\n      “Selena said, ‘If we’re not going to have a kid, I want my life to be f**king fabulous,’” recalls Luban. “And we were like, ‘Okay, what does that look like?’”\\n   \\n      They decided that, for them, this would be having the opportunity to live in another country, experience a different culture and learn the language.\\n   \\n      And Spain was now right at the top of their list.\\n   \\n      After sitting down and working out the figures, the couple realized that it would be “affordable” for them to live in Ronda for a year, provided Luban sold his acupuncture practice in California, which he managed to do within six weeks.\\n   \\n      They then whittled down all of their belongings “from two cars and a full house to two suitcases a piece,” and booked an Airbnb in Ronda to stay in before they found something more long-term.\\n   \\n      The pair flew back to Madrid in September 2016.\\n   \\n      “Four months after we left Ronda, we were back to stay,” says Luban. “For what we thought would be a year.”\\n   \\n      But while the town had seemed like a magical place when they’d visited a few months before, it looked far less appealing when they returned shortly after Feria de Pedro Romero, a festival dedicated to bullfighting.\\n   \\n      “We arrived on a Sunday, so it was after the party,” explains Medlen. “Everything was closed.\\n   \\n      “The town was kind of dead and they had not had the opportunity to clean up [from the festival] yet. So it was a really different experience.”\\n   \\n      Luban jokes that they found themselves walking down the road with their suitcases thinking, “Oh my God, what did we do to our lives?”\\n   \\n      Although they’d previously been told that they’d have plenty of options for long-term rentals once they were in Ronda, this turned out not to be the case, and they struggled to find somewhere suitable at first.\\n   \\n      The prices were also slightly higher than they’d estimated, although still more affordable than what they’d been paying in California.\\n   \\n      Despite these initial setbacks, the couple persevered and soon found an apartment. They went on to join a language school in order to learn Spanish, and say that this proved to be a massive turning point for them.\\n   \\n      “It’s probably the reason we stayed,” admits Medlen. “Because it was such a great place for forming community.”\\n   \\n      They began going to various classes four times a week, and were able to meet other expats and discuss their experiences with them, which helped them through the process tremendously.\\n   \\n      “Nobody in the US could relate to what we were doing,” explains Luban. “They all thought it was a great idea until we were going to do it. Then they were like, ‘What are you doing?’”\\n   \\n      As Luban has dual US-German citizenship, he didn’t need a visa to live in Spain. However, Medlen was required to obtain a residence permit.\\n   \\n      While they adapted to the Spanish lifestyle quickly, there were some aspects that they found difficult to get used to.\\n   \\n      “I think we struggled with the siesta concept,” admits Medlen. “We’d be gung-ho to get a bunch of things done, and we’d run into town to do those mundane tasks that we all have to do.\\n   \\n      “But everything’s closed between two and five. So you pretty much can’t do anything.”\\n   \\n      The pair admit that it took them some time to transition from being around expats constantly, to integrating within the Spanish community, and say that this is something that they’re still navigating.\\n   \\n      However, Luban emotionally recalls how the importance of this connection really hit home when he ended up in hospital after a bike accident last year and underwent emergency surgery.\\n   \\n      “It would have been a completely different and much less pleasant experience if we didn’t know people who happen to be nurses and knew the whole community,” Luban explains.\\n   \\n      “Whereas when we first got here, we weren’t part of that community. But we thought we were having our Spain experience with expats.”\\n   \\n      While the couple have private medical insurance, Luban was initially admitted to a public hospital, which wasn’t covered under their policy.\\n   \\n      “Being Americans, we thought, ‘This could ruin us. There goes Spain.’” admits Luban. “The next day, when I was released after I’d had surgery, a night there, my own room and two ambulance rides. They said, ‘Well, we need you to pay the bill. It’s 1,380 euros.’”\\n   \\n      He was particularly moved by the kindness shown by the local community, who dropped off food and constantly checked up on both of them.\\n   \\n      “In America, people would text you gift certificates and sad faces on the phone,” says Luban.\\n   \\n      “Here, people literally showed up at the door when Selena would be coming back from the hospital to give her a hug and tell her that they were going to be there. And they were there. For weeks.”\\n   \\n      While they’d initially planned to stay in Spain for a year, Luban and Medlen chose to extend their stay beyond this.\\n   \\n      The couple admit that watching Donald Trump being elected as president of the United States in November 2016 contributed to their decision to remain in Spain.\\n   \\n      “Once that happened, within a couple of months, our families were saying, ‘Don’t come back,’” says Luban, explaining that their relatives had been eager for them to return before the election result.\\n   \\n      “‘This country is changing. You really should just enjoy yourselves and not get caught up in all of the division that’s happening in the United States.’ That was just two months in.”\\n   \\n      Medlen points out that they both worked constantly while they were in the US, and felt as though they rarely got to spend time together, whereas they’ve been able to enjoy each other’s company a great deal more while living in Spain.\\n   \\n      Meanwhile, Luban’s health has improved during their time there, and he regularly rides with various local cycling groups. However, he says that he’s had his ups and downs “sleep-wise.”\\n   \\n      “The biggest thing is that we can manage our stress much better here,” he says. “When we’re not constantly worrying about our safety, money or whatever.”\\n   \\n      As they only had enough funds to cover a year living in Spain without working, the couple needed to start earning money again in order to extend their time there.\\n   \\n      Fortunately, Medlen was able to take on remote work for law firms in the US and Luban launched a website advising other practitioners on how to sell a medical practice.\\n   \\n      “I’d say we spend one fifth of what we would on food here, rather than California,” Luban estimates. “One eighth to one tenth on our living expenses. One eighth on health care.\\n   \\n      “And we had no idea how much your quality of life goes up when you’re not trying to meet all of those bills.”\\n   \\n      They both try to work around 20 hours a week, and say they’ve been able to live comfortably this way because their money goes much further in Spain.\\n   \\n      “We also have more time to cook, which brings your food bills down because you’re not buying takeout,” adds Medlen. “And we have more time to exercise. So I feel like we’re healthier.”\\n   \\n      Seven years after relocating to Ronda, the couple are very much settled, and even have a dog, named Lola Supernova.\\n   \\n      They say that they re-evaluate their decision each year, and weigh up whether they want to stay in Spain or move on.\\n   \\n      However, they’ve chosen not to buy a home there so that they have a little more freedom.\\n   \\n      “Wa take it to one year increments,” explains Medlen. “And we still rent our apartment that we live in.\\n   \\n      “We want to keep things simple and have flexibility so that we could change our minds and go somewhere else.”\\n   \\n      They return to the US every year and joke that they’re always shocked by how much a burrito at American food chain Chipotle is.\\n   \\n      “There’s been a lot of inflation since we left,” notes Medlen.\\n   \\n      While the couple still sometimes struggle with the prospect of not having children, Luban, now 53, says they feel “too old now,” adding that while they previously looked into adoption “the process seemed to be a nightmare, financially and otherwise.”\\n   \\n      “And it was such an emotionally (and financially) painful experience to try and fail, we couldn’t go through it again,” he adds, stressing that they have “no regrets.”\\n   \\n      “So we decided instead that we’d make our lives as interesting as possible.”\\n   \\n      Both acknowledge that one of the downsides of living in a different country for so long is that they don’t necessarily feel they belong anywhere.\\n   \\n      “We may never feel entirely at home in the US again, and we will never be truly accepted as Spanish,” admits Luban, noting that a “great way to learn about your country is to leave it.”\\n   \\n      “But Andalusia has taken us in, cared for us in a way we never could have imagined. Like interest on a bank account we never knew we had.”\\n  ',\n",

       " {'headline': '\\n      Why this American couple swapped California for Spain\\n    ',\n",
       "  'contents': ' \\n      After a number of failed IVF rounds, health issues and the death of their beloved dog, US couple Jason Luban and Selena Medlen were in need of a change of scenery.\\n   \\n      The couple, then based in Oakland, California, had penciled in a trip to Andalusia, Spain, months before, but were unsure whether to go ahead with it when the health of Luban, who has torsion dystonia, a rare movement disorder, began to deteriorate.\\n   \\n      “We were figuring out how to get him healthy again,” Medlen tells CNN Travel, before explaining that Luban was also grieving the loss of a friend and mentor. “So we had this vacation on the books, and we weren’t sure if he could travel.”\\n   \\n      According to Medlen, they ultimately decided to “go for it” after Luban, who suffers from insomnia, began sleeping better.\\n   \\n      “We thought, maybe we needed a break,” adds Medlen, who was working as an attorney at the time. “That if we could get away from everything, maybe he would start to feel better.”\\n   \\n      A friend had recommended that the pair, married since 2009, spend some time in Ronda, a town located in Spain’s Malaga province, so they decided to book two nights there.\\n   \\n      But neither could have predicted that they’d end up packing up their lives and relocating there just a few months later.\\n   \\n      In May 2016, they flew into Madrid, spending some time in the capital city, as well as Toledo, Cordoba and Seville, before heading to Ronda.\\n   \\n      “As we left Seville for Ronda, something shifted,” says Luban, an acupuncturist. “The land. The energy. “All [of] the plants were blooming.\\n   \\n      “There were all these colors everywhere. And we were both just in shock at how gorgeous it was as we kept climbing and climbing in the car.”\\n   \\n      When they reached the town, they were greeted by a parade, which set the tone for the rest of the weekend.\\n   \\n      The pair celebrated Medlen’s 38th birthday in Ronda, and say they were struck by how friendly everyone was.\\n   \\n      “Everything kind of came together for just a day or two while we were here,” says Luban, who is originally from Oregon while Medlen is from Texas.\\n   \\n      After wrapping up their time in the pretty town, they went on to visit Granada before returning to the US. But Ronda stayed with them.\\n   \\n      “We went back to our lives, which we realized really sucked compared to what our experience was here [in Ronda,]” admits Luban, before explaining that his insomnia returned once they were back in the US.\\n   \\n      “Also, we both had, unbeknownst to one another, looked in the windows of real estate offices to see what the rental prices were here [in Ronda]. And it was a tenth of what we were paying in California.”\\n   \\n      While lying on the couch one day and reflecting on their fertility struggles, they began discussing what they would want for their lives if they weren’t ever able to have children.\\n   \\n      “Selena said, ‘If we’re not going to have a kid, I want my life to be f**king fabulous,’” recalls Luban. “And we were like, ‘Okay, what does that look like?’”\\n   \\n      They decided that, for them, this would be having the opportunity to live in another country, experience a different culture and learn the language.\\n   \\n      And Spain was now right at the top of their list.\\n   \\n      After sitting down and working out the figures, the couple realized that it would be “affordable” for them to live in Ronda for a year, provided Luban sold his acupuncture practice in California, which he managed to do within six weeks.\\n   \\n      They then whittled down all of their belongings “from two cars and a full house to two suitcases a piece,” and booked an Airbnb in Ronda to stay in before they found something more long-term.\\n   \\n      The pair flew back to Madrid in September 2016.\\n   \\n      “Four months after we left Ronda, we were back to stay,” says Luban. “For what we thought would be a year.”\\n   \\n      But while the town had seemed like a magical place when they’d visited a few months before, it looked far less appealing when they returned shortly after Feria de Pedro Romero, a festival dedicated to bullfighting.\\n   \\n      “We arrived on a Sunday, so it was after the party,” explains Medlen. “Everything was closed.\\n   \\n      “The town was kind of dead and they had not had the opportunity to clean up [from the festival] yet. So it was a really different experience.”\\n   \\n      Luban jokes that they found themselves walking down the road with their suitcases thinking, “Oh my God, what did we do to our lives?”\\n   \\n      Although they’d previously been told that they’d have plenty of options for long-term rentals once they were in Ronda, this turned out not to be the case, and they struggled to find somewhere suitable at first.\\n   \\n      The prices were also slightly higher than they’d estimated, although still more affordable than what they’d been paying in California.\\n   \\n      Despite these initial setbacks, the couple persevered and soon found an apartment. They went on to join a language school in order to learn Spanish, and say that this proved to be a massive turning point for them.\\n   \\n      “It’s probably the reason we stayed,” admits Medlen. “Because it was such a great place for forming community.”\\n   \\n      They began going to various classes four times a week, and were able to meet other expats and discuss their experiences with them, which helped them through the process tremendously.\\n   \\n      “Nobody in the US could relate to what we were doing,” explains Luban. “They all thought it was a great idea until we were going to do it. Then they were like, ‘What are you doing?’”\\n   \\n      As Luban has dual US-German citizenship, he didn’t need a visa to live in Spain. However, Medlen was required to obtain a residence permit.\\n   \\n      While they adapted to the Spanish lifestyle quickly, there were some aspects that they found difficult to get used to.\\n   \\n      “I think we struggled with the siesta concept,” admits Medlen. “We’d be gung-ho to get a bunch of things done, and we’d run into town to do those mundane tasks that we all have to do.\\n   \\n      “But everything’s closed between two and five. So you pretty much can’t do anything.”\\n   \\n      The pair admit that it took them some time to transition from being around expats constantly, to integrating within the Spanish community, and say that this is something that they’re still navigating.\\n   \\n      However, Luban emotionally recalls how the importance of this connection really hit home when he ended up in hospital after a bike accident last year and underwent emergency surgery.\\n   \\n      “It would have been a completely different and much less pleasant experience if we didn’t know people who happen to be nurses and knew the whole community,” Luban explains.\\n   \\n      “Whereas when we first got here, we weren’t part of that community. But we thought we were having our Spain experience with expats.”\\n   \\n      While the couple have private medical insurance, Luban was initially admitted to a public hospital, which wasn’t covered under their policy.\\n   \\n      “Being Americans, we thought, ‘This could ruin us. There goes Spain.’” admits Luban. “The next day, when I was released after I’d had surgery, a night there, my own room and two ambulance rides. They said, ‘Well, we need you to pay the bill. It’s 1,380 euros.’”\\n   \\n      He was particularly moved by the kindness shown by the local community, who dropped off food and constantly checked up on both of them.\\n   \\n      “In America, people would text you gift certificates and sad faces on the phone,” says Luban.\\n   \\n      “Here, people literally showed up at the door when Selena would be coming back from the hospital to give her a hug and tell her that they were going to be there. And they were there. For weeks.”\\n   \\n      While they’d initially planned to stay in Spain for a year, Luban and Medlen chose to extend their stay beyond this.\\n   \\n      The couple admit that watching Donald Trump being elected as president of the United States in November 2016 contributed to their decision to remain in Spain.\\n   \\n      “Once that happened, within a couple of months, our families were saying, ‘Don’t come back,’” says Luban, explaining that their relatives had been eager for them to return before the election result.\\n   \\n      “‘This country is changing.

       " {'headline': '\\n      Two strangers moved into an apartment in Prague. Then they fell in love\\n    ',\n",
       "  'contents': ' \\n      Mandy Sanchez was sitting in her bedroom in Texas when she saw the listing.\\n   \\n      A spacious room in an Art Nouveau building in the buzzy Vinohrady neighborhood, near the city’s Riegrovy Sady park, known for its beautiful sunsets.\\n   \\n      It was December 2019. Mandy was a 22-year-old about to graduate Texas A&M University. She was planning to move to Prague to teach English.\\n   \\n      She’d joined a Facebook group called “Flatshare in Prague”, hoping to find somewhere to live. The Vinohrady room was advertised by a Facebook user called Marcus Wecksten. Alongside photos of the apartment, Marcus wrote that the current inhabitants were two guys – one Finnish (Marcus) and one German (his roommate, Boris). Marcus and Boris were both students in Prague and were looking for someone to move in ASAP.\\n   \\n      Mandy thought the apartment looked perfect: great neighborhood, nice-looking space – and the room was within her budget. It was almost too good to be true. She fired off a message right away, expressing her interest.\\n   \\n      Marcus was studying in his bedroom in the Prague apartment when Mandy’s message popped up on his laptop.\\n   \\n      “Sounds great,” he said. “Can you come by sometime next week for a viewing?”\\n   \\n      “I’m in Texas,” explained Mandy. “I’m moving to Prague in January.”\\n   \\n      Marcus considered this. They wouldn’t be able to meet Mandy before she signed the lease, which wasn’t ideal. He wrote back to Mandy, apologizing, explaining it wouldn’t work out.\\n   \\n      But Mandy was determined. “We could Skype?” she suggested. “I really want this room.”\\n   \\n      Marcus – who, back then, was 25 and midway through a medical degree at Prague’s Charles University – had met his roommate Boris at college. The two had lived in the Vinohrady apartment for a couple of years.\\n   \\n      “It was a super-nice apartment in one of the coolest neighborhoods in Prague,” Marcus tells CNN Travel.\\n \\n      A revolving door of fellow students had rented the third room over the years.\\n   \\n      “We were looking for somebody social, who wanted to hang out with us in the communal space, in the living room – that’s where we spent quite a bit of time,” Marcus recalls. “I don’t know what the other requirements were, but probably the basic ones – somebody clean…”\\n   \\n      In the subsequent Skype interview, Mandy recalls Boris being particularly concerned about her potential cleanliness.\\n   \\n      “He asked a lot about if I would help out with the cleaning,” she says. “But I was the one who was more worried about, ‘Are they going to be clean?’ Because it’s two guys…”\\n   \\n      Shared standards of cleanliness confirmed, Mandy, Marcus and Boris spent much of the Skype call talking about the Vinohrady neighborhood and the nearby amenities. Towards the end, they segued into chatting about themselves.\\n   \\n      “I thought that it was super-interesting that Mandy was from Texas,” says Marcus. “I had never met a Texan in my life. I had this stereotypical picture of a Texan in a cowboy hat and boots and a revolver.”\\n   \\n      For her part, Mandy hung up the call with the impression Marcus and Boris were friendly and “normal.”\\n   \\n      “I hung up and basically was like, ‘Okay, they’re not going to murder me. They seem like nice people. I probably could enter their apartment and we would be okay.’”\\n   \\n      After a follow-up call to iron out details, Marcus and Boris offered Mandy the room. By coincidence, this message arrived on the day of Mandy’s college graduation.\\n   \\n      Midway through celebrating her graduation, Mandy filled in her parents and sister on her new home. She extolled its virtues – amazing location, great-looking building, and mentioned in passing that the roommates were two guys who were medical students.\\n   \\n      “My parents were like, ‘We hope you don’t fall in love with either of them, because if you do, that means you’re going to live in Europe forever,’” Mandy recalls.\\n   \\n      “I was like, ‘Why would that be the case?’ And they said, ‘Well, because they’re going to be getting medically licensed in Europe, and then that’s not going to transfer easily to the US. So, if you fall in love with one of them, you’re staying there forever.’”\\n   \\n      Her parents were speaking in jest – at least in part. But Mandy cut through their teasing tone, wanting to set the record straight.\\n   \\n      “That is not what I’m going to Europe for,” she said.\\n   \\n      And it was true.\\n   \\n      “I wasn’t moving there to fall in love,” says Mandy today.\\n   \\n      But the universe had other ideas.\\n   \\n      Mandy had never been to Prague before. She’d scrolled through photos online and marveled at how beautiful it looked. She’d got tips from friends who’d visited and fallen in love with the city. She’d started to imagine herself living in the apartment in Vinohrady.\\n   \\n      But none of this could prepare her for the whirlwind of her arrival day.\\n   \\n      “I don’t really think I was thinking – it was just all happening,” Mandy recalls.\\n   \\n      She remembers getting into an Uber at the airport and peering out the window. It was only 5:30 p.m., but it was already pitch black outside. As she got closer to the city, the spires of Prague Castle were illuminated. Mandy felt a mixture of exhaustion, excitement and disbelief that this new stage of her life had started.\\n   \\n      Meanwhile, Marcus and Boris had spent most of that day deep-cleaning their apartment.\\n   \\n      “We were cleaning corners of the apartment that hadn’t been cleaned in a long time,” says Marcus. “We wanted to make a good impression on Mandy.”\\n   \\n      Marcus had just taken out the last trash bag and dumped it in the communal bins when Mandy’s Uber pulled up in front of the building.\\n   \\n      “She gets out, the driver helped her with her bags,” Marcus recalls. “My first impression is that she’s super-cute. She’s tiny, but she seems to have a lot of energy and she’s very cute.”\\n   \\n      Mandy smiled as the Uber drove away.\\n   \\n      “Oh, you must be Marcus,” she said.\\n   \\n      Marcus reached out his hand for Mandy to shake. The moment was a little awkward, but friendly.\\n   \\n      Then, Marcus took Mandy’s bags and carried them up the stairs.\\n   \\n      “I was like, ‘Oh, that’s very nice that he took my bags. Duly noted,’” recalls Mandy.\\n   \\n      Inside the new apartment, Mandy met Boris and offered to treat her new roommates to take-out.\\n   \\n      The next thing she knew, Marcus was putting through a pizza order on his laptop.\\n   \\n      “I had to awkwardly hand him my credit card,” says Mandy “He’s typing in the details. And then, Google Chrome asks if he wants to save the card. And I was like, ‘You better not save that card information.’”\\n   \\n      Mandy was only half-joking. She recalls thinking: “This is kind of weird. I just met this guy. And I’m giving him my credit card information.”\\n   \\n      For the next couple of hours, Mandy, Marcus and Boris sat around eating pizza and chatting.\\n   \\n      Mandy appreciated how welcoming her new roommates were. And she thought Marcus was “cute.”\\n   \\n      “But also I was tired,” she says. “I was like, ‘Maybe I’m delusional.’”\\n   \\n      After dinner, Mandy, exhausted from the flight, decamped to her bedroom and went to sleep. She woke up wondering if she’d still find Marcus attractive after sleeping off the jet lag. Her question was answered as soon as she saw him in the kitchen, smiling at her.\\n   \\n      Over the next week, Mandy and Marcus got to know each other. They ate dinner out most nights – just the two of them. Boris was always invited, but often had plans and couldn’t join.\\n   \\n      Mandy says she and Marcus “clicked right away.”\\n   \\n      “There was a lot of chemistry between us. But it was chemistry that you’re not sure what you should do with,” she says.\\n   \\n      Mandy was conscious they’d just moved in together – she didn’t want to halt a potential friendship or upset their living situation.\\n   \\n      But Marcus didn’t quite have the same reservations about potentially dating his roommate.\\n   \\n      “I was probably more riding the wave of what was happening,” he says. “I didn’t really think about the potential consequences so much, I was more like, ‘Feels good. Let’s go for it.’”\\n   \\n      Despite Mandy’s hesitations, she and Marcus grew closer and closer. Mandy couldn’t deny what she calls “the immediacy of the draw we had to each other.”\\n   \\n      Before long, they were dating in all but name. They went out to dinner together, explored Prague side by side, and spent hours talking together in the apartment. They traveled out of Prague to the Pilsner Brewery together, enjoying a tour and spending the evening sharing beers. On Valentine’s Day, around a month after she’d moved in, Marcus cooked for Mandy. Boris walked in and raised an eyebrow at the obvious romantic undertones.\\n   \\n      But all the while Mandy and Marcus grew closer, the shadow of coronavirus was becoming harder to ignore. When Mandy arrived in Europe, the pandemic was a distant rumbling of thunder. By early March, the storm had broken over Europe.\\n   \\n      Mandy woke up one morning to an email from her parents. The US border was closing. They’d bought her a plane ticket home.\\n   \\n      “Here’s your plane ticket, it leaves on Thursday, and we have 24 hours to cancel it. So it’s fully refundable,” read the email. “You’re an adult, you can make your own decisions. But we would really like you to come home.”\\n   \\n      Mandy wasn’t sure what to do. If she left, her visa would be nulled and it wouldn’t be easy for her to come back. Her burgeoning connection with Marcus would end before it had even begun.\\n   \\n      But on the flip side, this was a global crisis. Surely it made sense to be with her loved ones in her home country? If she stayed, would she be stuck in Prague indefinitely?\\n   \\n      “I think I’m falling in love,” Mandy thought. “I don’t want this to end. But I also don’t know if this is a mistake not to go home.”\\n   \\n      Boris had already returned to Germany. But Marcus wasn’t sure if he would go back to Finland. He hadn’t spoken the words aloud, but it seemed like he was waiting to see what Mandy would do.\\n   \\n      Over the next 24 hours Mandy flip-flopped between staying and going. Eventually, she and Marcus talked through their options together.\\n   \\n      “We didn’t go out and say, ‘Hey, we will fight through this Covid together, united,’” says Marcus. “It was more carefully trying to pique each other’s interest.”\\n   \\n      “If you stay, I’ll stay,” Mandy and Marcus eventually decided.\\n   \\n      “Once we had decided that we would both stay, it felt very exciting for me,” says Marcus.\\n   \\n      Over the next few months, as Prague descended into a strict lockdown, Mandy and Marcus were together pretty much 24/7.\\n   \\n      Marcus started experimenting with cooking elaborate meals. Mandy would sit on the couch, drinking wine, cheering him on and keeping him company.\\n   \\n      The two spent long evenings sharing stories and talking about their lives.\\n   \\n      “We grew much closer and developed much stronger feelings for each other,” says Marcus. “We spent so much time together, just the two of us and got to open up about stuff.”\\n   \\n      For Marcus, the more introverted of the pair, spending time with Mandy at home was the ideal way to get to know her properly.\\n   \\n      “I felt quite comfortable and safe in that home environment,” he says. “So I felt like I could be myself. And also with Mandy – just her personality meant it was very easy to be myself.”\\n   \\n      Mandy found it harder to be in the moment. She loved spending time with Marcus, but she couldn’t help but worry about the potential future complications of dating someone from a different country.\\n   \\n      She also struggled not to let the grim realities of the pandemic infiltrate their bubble.\\n   \\n      “Everything was still quite up in the air,” she recalls. “We hadn’t defined the relationship, but I stayed for this man, basically. And I’ve just moved here, and I’m still under a visa process that’s ongoing, and the world is up in flames and all of these things…So it wasn’t necessarily like, ‘Oh, I feel safe and at home with you.’ It was pretty hectic for me still.”\\n   \\n      Despite this, Mandy recalls many bright spots.\\n   \\n      “We spent a lot of time in the park, drinking prosecco and having a grand old time,” she says.\\n   \\n      Prague, usually packed with tourists, was sleepy and empty.\\n   \\n      Mandy and Marcus recall “walking on the Charles Bridge, and absolutely no one was there.”\\n   \\n      Despite the grim circumstances, the empty city “was pretty cool.”\\n   \\n      Summer rolled around, Prague’s pandemic restrictions eased a little. Marcus was set to head back to Finland for his summer vacation to work. He was set to be away from the Czech Republic for three months.\\n   \\n      “The night before he left, I’m crying and I’m like, ‘Oh, gosh, you’re leaving and I’m so sad,’” recalls Mandy.\\n   \\n      That was the moment Mandy and Marcus finally spoke their feelings aloud – and confirmed they were committed to being together.\\n   \\n      During their three months apart, Mandy and Marcus only grew more certain of this fact. Mandy recalls phoning her mother, telling her she knew she was in love with Marcus and she hoped he felt the same way.\\n   \\n      When Marcus returned to the apartment in Vinohrady, he told Mandy he was in love with her.\\n   \\n      “Thank goodness,” said Mandy, laughing.\\n   \\n      It was then that she finally let herself relax into this new reality. Marcus was her boyfriend, and despite the stresses that defined 2020, Mandy was happy. She loved living in Prague. She decided to extend her time there, using the pandemic as an excuse – pretty much all her teaching had taken place online, after all, she hadn’t really had the experience she’d planned.\\n   \\n      Whenever she was asked, Mandy was vague about how much longer she’d stay.\\n   \\n      “It was always, ‘A while longer,’” says Mandy. “Never really a defined end.”\\n   \\n      Boris returned to Prague, bemused by how Marcus and Mandy’s relationship had grown in his absence. He was happy for them.\\n   \\n      “I left Mandy and Marcus as two new roommates and met them again when I came back as a well established couple with their own traditions and habits,” Boris tells CNN Travel. “It was a very cute situation to witness.”\\n   \\n      The following summer, in July 2021, Mandy traveled with Marcus to Finland to spend time with his friends and family and get a glimpse into his culture and country.\\n   \\n      “Introducing Mandy to my friends felt really great,” recalls Marcus. “She seemed to click with everyone.”\\n   \\n      “Meeting his family and coming to Finland was that final puzzle piece for me,” says Mandy.\\n   \\n      When the US borders reopened later that year, Marcus traveled with Mandy to Texas to meet Mandy’s loved ones.\\n   \\n      “Her parents and sister, they were all super-embracing and I really felt like I was part of the family from the get-go,” says Marcus.\\n   \\n      After those important introductions, “we felt it was getting more serious,” says Mandy.\\n   \\n      But Mandy and Marcus’ future still felt like it came with a lot of question marks. If they stayed together, where would they live? Mandy’s parents’ initial tongue-in-cheek comments about marrying her medical student roommates still stood – Marcus wouldn’t be able to practice medicine in the US, so living there seemed out of the question.\\n   \\n      During this time, Marcus and Mandy decided to go to couples therapy, figuring it was important to talk through some of these uncertainties.\\n   \\n      “I think that was really helpful for us in terms of – there’s so many things to think about with an intercultural relationship – where we’re going to live and all of these really heavy questions,” says Mandy.\\n   \\n      “We had a really great therapist in Prague, and that really helped us to feel a lot more serious and have a very solid foundation.”\\n   \\n      The couple confirmed they “saw life together” and decided it was OK to just “try to figure it out step by step.”\\n   \\n      “We feel very secure,” says Marcus. “We know that it’s going to be the two of us going forward.”\\n   \\n      Cut to spring 2023, three years since Mandy moved to Prague, and three years since she met Marcus.\\n   \\n      The couple were starting to suspect they’d have to leave the city they both loved. Marcus was about to graduate medical school, and it was looking like it would be easier for him to get a job in Finland.\\n   \\n      To mark three years together, Marcus decided to surprise Mandy with a photoshoot – he figured they’d both appreciate having some nice photos at some of their favorite Prague spots.\\n   \\n      The couple, photographer in tow, headed to a park where the trees were covered in pastel-colored blossoms. Mandy had long been obsessed with the blooming spring trees, she’d never seen anything like them in Texas.\\n   \\n      As the photographer took a couple of preliminary photographs of Mandy, Marcus seized the moment. He knelt behind her. When Mandy turned around, she was initially confused. Then it twigged – he was proposing.\\n   \\n      The subsequent photos captured Mandy’s pure delight. In fact, in all the photos taken that day, Mandy and Marcus are glowing with happiness.\\n   \\n      The shoot concluded on the Charles Bridge. As Mandy and Marcus stood there, looking out over the city arm in arm, Mandy suggested they should celebrate at their favorite restaurant.\\n   \\n      “Well, it depends on how long it takes you to pack,” said Marcus.\\n   \\n      “He’d planned a night or two at a spa hotel in Karlovy Vary, which is a spa town two hours outside of Prague,” explains Mandy.\\n   \\n      The couple spent the rest of the weekend toasting their future.\\n   \\n      This past summer, Marcus and Mandy left Prague and moved to Helsinki, Finland. It was bittersweet saying goodbye to the city that shaped their relationship, but the couple are excited for this next chapter, and plan to stay in Helsinki for the next couple of years.\\n   \\n      Mandy and Marcus will return to Prague next spring for their wedding – a weekend celebration in which friends and family from across the globe, including, of course, their former roommate Boris, will convene in the Czech Republic to celebrate Mandy and Marcus’ love story.\\n   \\n      On their wedding website, Marcus and Mandy listed some of their favorite places in Prague for guests unfamiliar with the city. They eschewed the obvious spots – they’re available for anyone to Google – in favor of the local haunts they loved. Naturally, the Vinohrady apartment is top of that list.\\n   \\n      Marcus and Mandy look back at their time there very fondly. Marcus marvels at the “small, tiny events” that lead them to cross paths, live in that apartment together and fall in love.\\n   \\n      Mandy expresses “how absolutely joyful, smitten, and thankful we are that we allowed ourselves the joy of loving each other – even when we weren’t sure how things would turn out.”\\n   \\n      “We’ve experienced quite a bit in these few years together and are so happy that we get to continue going through life together,” Mandy says. “It’s been the greatest and most unexpected adventure.”\\n  ',\n",

       " {'headline': '\\n      Thousands flock to Trinity Site for the first time since ‘Oppenheimer’s’ release\\n    ',\n",
       "  'contents': ' \\n“Oppenheimer” may have given the Trinity Site a boost of fame this summer, but for many history buffs, making a pilgrimage to the area is a journey years in the making.\\n   \\n      Nearly 4,000 people flocked to the Trinity Site this past Saturday, according to the White Sand Missile Range Public Affairs Office, waiting hours to visit the infamous ground zero, where the first atomic bomb was detonated.\\n   \\n      David Tise, a 33-year-old National Park Service Ranger at Carlsbad Caverns in New Mexico and a self-described “historical nutcase,” took Friday off work to make the 2.5-hour drive to Alamogordo, New Mexico. He then woke up at 5:30 a.m. and made the two-hour drive to the site, where he then waited in line for about 90 minutes. In total, that’s about six hours — all just to see the Trinity Site, a goal he’s had for years.\\n   \\n      “The thing that stood out the most was how isolated it was,” Tise told CNN. “Even back then, how they transported everything for the test from Los Alamos without anyone noticing.”\\n   \\n      The Trinity Site only opens to the public twice a year, on the first Saturday in April and the third Saturday in October, said Drew Hamilton, a spokesperson with the White Sand Missile Range Public Affairs Office.\\n   \\n      Because of the success of the “Oppenheimer” movie, which tells the story of J. Robert Oppenheimer and the Manhattan Project, staff were expecting closer to 5,000 visitors this year, Hamilton said. Still, 4,000 is “on the higher end,” he said, a trend he expects to continue for next year’s April opening.\\n   \\n      Tise, who completed his first visit this year, called the experience “sobering.”\\n   \\n      “The Trinity test helped win World War II and saved countless American lives. However, the area is still a little radioactive and the test destroyed the environment for years after,” he said. “I’m not a warmonger or anything but I don’t think anyone should have that much power to destroy the world.”\\n   \\n      Zach Berkowitz, an 18-year-old high school student from Colorado, also had a long journey to see the site. Berkowitz and his father woke up at 5:15 a.m. on Saturday and drove an hour from their hotel to the Trinity Site, where they then waited almost two hours just to enter.\\n   \\n      Berkowitz is interested in nuclear history and has wanted to see the site for years, he said. But his dad needed convincing — only agreeing to do the drive after seeing “Oppenheimer.”\\n   \\n      “Seeing the pieces of trinitite on the ground was really interesting, since it really made it clear that I was standing somewhere special,” Berkowtiz said.\\n   \\n      Trinitite, the glass-like chunks that appeared on the desert floor following the Trinity explosion, are illegal to collect due to concerns of radioactivity. Based on what other people’s Geiger counters detected, the trinitite was more radioactive than Berkowitz had expected, he said. He tried to pick one up, but was told not to by an Army member.\\n   \\n      “If I could have taken a piece home, I would have,” he said. “But doing so is illegal.”\\n   \\n      Though this year’s opening doesn’t quite beat the record for visitors – that would be 2015’s 70th anniversary, for which more than 5,000 people made the trek — this year’s event still attracted the usual “wide array of visitors,” Hamilton said, “from those who just happened to be stopping by to those that had planned entire vacations around making it out.”\\n   \\n      “Everybody that’s there is excited to be there, just because we don’t open the site up so often, so it is kind of a treat,” he said. “And the majority of visitors are history buffs anyway. So getting out and being able to go to a site that isn’t open very often, and is such a significant historical point on the globe, is a real fun thing for them.”\\n  ',\n",

       "  'contents': ' \\n      Cambodia’s newest and biggest airport opened to commercial operations in the province of Siem Reap in the country’s northwest this week.\\n   \\n      The China-funded Siem Reap-Angkor International Airport is now the main gateway to one of the country’s most popular tourist sites, the UNESCO-listed Angkor Archaeological Complex.\\n   \\n      On Monday morning, a flight operated by Thailand’s Bangkok Airways was the first to land at the new airport, which is located about 40 kilometers (25 miles) away from the protected area.\\n   \\n      Using the International Air Transport Association-designated code SAI, it replaces Siem Reap International Airport (REP), which first opened in 1932 and is only a few kilometers away from the Angkor complex.\\n   \\n      The new airport, funded by China as part of its\\xa0Belt\\xa0and\\xa0Road Initiative at a cost of about $1.1 billion, was designed to initially handle 7 million passengers a year – 2 million more than REP – and has a 3,600-meter-long runway.\\n   \\n      According to the Economic and Commercial Office of the Chinese Embassy in Cambodia, it’s the first overseas international airport to be constructed under a “Build-Operate-Transfer” model by Chinese enterprises and is operated and managed by the Yunnan Aviation Industry Investment Group. Designated a “4E\\xa0airport,” it can accommodate larger commercial planes, including many of those used on global long-haul routes.\\n   \\n      Construction began in 2020, with the airport design reportedly inspired by the traditional Cambodian architecture style. The official airport website offers minimal information on available services, shops and restaurants at the new facility, however, it does provide a full schedule of departing and arriving flights.\\n   \\n      Recent data released by Cambodia’s Ministry of Tourism reveals the country received 3.5 million international tourists in the first eight months of 2023.\\n   \\n      That’s an increase of 250.8% over the same period last year, but a decrease of 19.7% over 2019, before the country closed its borders because of the pandemic. Cambodia relaxed its Covid entry restrictions and reopened to tourists in March 2022. The country is on track to receive approximately 4.5 to five million international tourists by the end of this year, says the ministry.\\n   \\n      Many of those visitors head to Siem Reap to experience the Angkor complex,\\xa0which is one of the most important archaeological sites in Southeast Asia, according to the UNESCO inscription.\\n   \\n      Stretching over 400 square kilometers, the park contains the remains of the different capitals of the Khmer Empire, from the 9th to the 15th century. But only a handful of its sites – namely Angkor Wat, Angkor Thom and the Bayon – receive the bulk of tourist traffic.\\n  ',\n",

       " {'headline': '\\n      A kid posed with his pilot dad in an airplane. Almost 30 years later they recreated the photo\\n    ',\n",
       "  'contents': ' \\n      Ruben Flowers stumbled across the photo by accident.\\n   \\n      It was early 2023 and he was thumbing through photo albums at his grandmother’s house. Suddenly, there it was: a snapshot from 1994, taken in an airplane flight deck, depicting him as a toddler, sitting next to his pilot dad.\\n   \\n      In this picture, Flowers is looking at his dad in admiration. His father smiles at the camera, ready to fly the plane.\\n   \\n      Flowers had forgotten the photo existed, but seeing it again, he was flooded with memories of growing up, inspired by his father. He’d loved their trips to the airport, tagging along to the training center, taking a go on the simulators. He’d beamed with pride when his dad talked about his job at the school careers day.\\n   \\n      And the timing of the rediscovered photo was perfect: Flowers, now 30, was just about to follow in his father’s footsteps and begin flying as a First Officer for Southwest Airlines.\\n   \\n      Meanwhile Flowers’ father – also called Ruben Flowers – was nearing retirement and readying for his final Southwest flight as Captain.\\n   \\n      The two men were excited to briefly overlap at Southwest and hoped they’d get an opportunity to fly together.\\n   \\n      “It was a dream of mine to make it to this point to fly with my dad, it was probably my number one aviation goal,” the younger Flowers tells CNN Travel.\\n \\n      After rediscovering the old photo, the two Flowers men added a coda to the goal: not only did they want to fly together, they wanted to recreate the 1990s flight deck photo, over two decades later. Not just as father and son, but as colleagues and co-pilots.\\n   \\n      Cut to March 2023 and the older Flowers was flying his final Southwest flight, piloting an aircraft from Omaha, Nebraska to his home city of Chicago, Illinois. His son was by his side, as his first officer.\\n   \\n      “That was an awesome feeling,” says the older Flowers. “To look over there and see my son, next to me, for my last landing.”\\n   \\n      And, naturally, they recreated the 1994 photo, both grinning happily in the 2023 version.\\n   \\n      “It was just great to be able to recreate that moment,” says the younger Flowers. “It was a dream come true moment.”\\n   \\n      Also on board the older Flowers’ retirement flight was his brother and his cousin, who both work for Southwest too. In case you hadn’t realized by now, flying truly is a family affair for the Flowers.\\n   \\n      “There are seven of us,” explains the older Flowers. “Me. My brother’s a pilot. I have three kids, all pilots. And my brother’s son is a pilot and my cousin is a pilot. And it’s just amazing to me that they all wanted to be pilots.”\\n   \\n      At family events and on holidays, the Flowers family try to keep work talk to a minimum “but there’s always a story that sparks it off, and then it gets into aviation,” as the younger Flowers puts it.\\n   \\n      The Flowers family aviation legacy began when the older Flowers was a kid growing up in Michigan in the 1960s and 70s.\\n   \\n      “A pilot one day asked me if I wanted to come up to the cockpit. And I did it,” he recalls. “And oh, my God, it was like the bug bit me – I wanted to be a pilot. And from that point on, I just focused on being an airline pilot.”\\n   \\n      Once he qualified, the older Flowers made it his mission to inspire others to follow in his footsteps. The fact that ended up including many of his loved ones was accidental. He says he always encouraged his kids to explore whatever they loved, whatever that might be.\\n   \\n      The younger Flowers says that while he grew up in awe of his dad and proud of his work, he didn’t officially decide to become an aviator until midway through college.\\n   \\n      Looking back now though, he thinks the signs were always pointing in that direction.\\n   \\n      “It was always something that was probably in the back of my head that I probably wanted to do all my life,” he says.\\n   \\n      The older Flowers’ retirement flight was always going to be emotional, and having his son by his side only made it more so. He says it’s not surprising that when they pulled into the gate “some tears came down.”\\n   \\n      The younger Flowers says the in-air, father-son working dynamic wasn’t dissimilar from “doing the lawn together, or something of that nature.”\\n   \\n      “It just worked out smooth and naturally, and it went great,” he says, although he adds he was definitely trying to “impress” his dad with his skills and competency.\\n   \\n      The older Flowers says he was aware the flight was a one-off opportunity for him to pass on flying intel to his son in situ.\\n   \\n      “It went really well, it was nice and smooth,” he says of the experience. “And it was an awesome feeling – making a PA to the passengers, and they find out there’s a father and son up there in the cockpit. Everybody clapping…”\\n   \\n      While the older Flowers has now left Southwest, his legacy lives on at the airline – not only via his son, but via other aviators he worked with and mentored over the years.\\n   \\n      Flowers speaks fondly of his own mentor, Louis Freeman, who became Southwest Airlines first Black pilot when he was hired in 1980.\\n   \\n      “He was a mentor to me,” says the older Flowers of Freeman. “And now I’m trying to be a mentor to others. And I hope my son can be a mentor to others, not just family members.”\\n   \\n      While at Southwest, Flowers was part of the airline’s Adopt-A-Pilot program, working with elementary school kids to inspire them to explore careers in aviation.\\n   \\n      He’s also a longtime member of the Organization of Black Aerospace Professionals (OBAP), where he works to uplift Black aviators.\\n   \\n      He encourages prospective pilots to do their research online, look out for programmes, and speak to anyone and everyone they can to get inspiration, information and advice.\\n   \\n      The younger Flowers echoes this – he’s actively involved in mentoring young pilots via social media, but he’s also had the occasional in-person conversation with a prospective pilot while transiting through the airport. He says if he can, he’ll always stop and pass on a few words of wisdom between flights.\\n   \\n      As for his own personal goals, now that he’s achieved his dream of flying with his father, the younger Flowers next dream is to fly side-by-side with his younger brother, who has just recently completed pilot training.\\n   \\n      He’s already had the pleasure of flying with his pilot sister several years ago and says it would be incredible if he could complete the family trifecta.\\n   \\n      “That’s what I’m looking forward to, is to be able to fly in the plane with my brother,” he says.\\n   \\n      The older Flowers is excited for that day too, and says he’s unendingly proud of his three children.\\n   \\n      “It’s unbelievable,” he says. “It’s an awesome feeling to know that my son is flying, and my daughter and my youngest son, all three of them are flyers.”\\n  ',\n",

Neither Real Madrid nor Vinícius have publicly commented on the tweet.\\n   \\n      Vinícius has been the subject of racist abuse multiple times throughout his career\\xa0in Spain, most recently while playing for\\xa0Los Blancos\\xa0against Sevilla last Saturday.\\n   \\n      The Brazilian has spoken out multiple times about the racism he has received and, amid questions about whether they have done\\xa0enough,\\xa0Spanish soccer and legal authorities are ramping up their efforts to combat the abuse.\\n   \\n      Vinícius testified earlier this month in a Spanish court about a racist incident which took place in the Mestalla Stadium when Madrid played Valencia.\\xa0Three people were arrested for allegedly making racist remarks towards the player and are being accused of committing a hate crime.\\n   \\n      Asked about Camps’ tweet after\\xa0Barça’s\\xa02-1 victory against Shakhtar Donetsk on Wednesday, Blaugrana manager Xavi told reporters: “Well, if\\xa0[Camps]\\xa0deleted it, it already means something. No need for me to say anything. If he deleted it,\\xa0we leave it\\xa0with that.”\\n   \\n      He added: “I don’t like tension.

We’ve lived some\\xa0Clásicos\\xa0with a lot of tension and it won’t be me to generate this tension.”\\n   \\n      Saturday’s El Clásico\\xa0– one of the oldest and most famous rivalries in soccer, which has featured intense and controversial incidents throughout the years – sees the first- and third-placed teams in La Liga face each other with just one point separating them in the table.\\n   \\n      Following last Saturday’s game between Sevilla and Real Madrid, the Andalusian club said that a member of the public had been ejected from the stadium, handed to legal authorities and will now have their membership revoked due to racist behavior.\\n   \\n      Footage and pictures widely posted on social media show a man performing monkey gestures towards Vinícius during the match.\\n   \\n      Writing on X about the incident, Vinícius said: “I hope the Spanish authorities do their bit and change the legislation once and for all.

       "  'contents': ' \\n      NBA great and popular TV analyst Charles Barkley has urged Ja Morant to focus on basketball and “stay out of trouble” as the Memphis Grizzlies’ star continues to serve a lengthy suspension for incidents involving firearms.\\n   \\n      In June, the NBA suspended Morant for 25 games without pay after he was involved in several incidents where he was caught on video with guns which were published on social media.\\n   \\n      The suspension runs through the start of the current 2023-24 regular season, which tipped off on Tuesday. The first game Morant would be eligible to play is on December 19 against the New Orleans Pelicans.\\n   \\n      Morant had already been suspended from team activities in May after an Instagram Live video appearing to show him flashing a gun while in a vehicle with others circulated on social media, just two months after he was suspended over a similar video.\\n   \\n      The NBA had previously suspended Morant for eight games without pay in March after he was seen in a different Instagram Live video holding a gun in a nightclub in Glendale, Colorado, a suburb of Denver.\\n   \\n      Barkley, who is set to host a new prime-time show on CNN alongside \\u200b\\u200bGayle King, has previously criticized Morant and explained his reasons for doing so in an in-depth interview with Chris Wallace host of “Who’s Talking to Chris Wallace” streaming now on Max.\\n   \\n      “He’s caught with a gun, he gets suspended and then, less than two months later, he gets filmed again on Instagram with a gun and you’re like, ‘Kid can’t be that stupid,’” said Barkley.\\n   \\n      “[The] kid is getting paid close to $100 million and the only thing you have to do is don’t be a fool. Just play basketball. Ain‘t like it’s a real job.\\n   \\n      “We’re not like teachers. We’re not like firemen. We’re not like policemen. We’re not somebody who’s in the service. We’re not a doctor. Those are five real jobs.\\n   \\n      “Real jobs [with] people who will never make a lot of money and all you have to do is dribble a stupid basketball and stay out of trouble.”\\n   \\n      After receiving his suspension, Morant apologized and said he would use the time off to work on his mental health and decision-making.\\n   \\n      “I’m sorry for the harm I’ve done,” he said in a statement.\\n   \\n      “To the kids who look up to me, I’m sorry for failing you as a role model. I promise I’m going to be better. To all of my sponsors, I’m going to be a better representation of our brands. And to all of my fans, I’m going to make it up to you, I promise.”\\n   \\n      CNN has reached out to Morant’s representatives for comment.\\n   \\n      Barkley said he would never shy away from giving his opinion on air, adding that “you lose credibility” when you don’t tell the truth on television.\\n   \\n      His authenticity and willingness to speak his mind have helped the former NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP) become one of the most popular television personalities in the US.\\n   \\n      It follows a brilliant career in the league, where he played 16 seasons and was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame in 2006.\\n   \\n      Despite never winning an NBA Championship, the 60-year-old won two Olympic gold medals, made 11 All-Star teams, won the MVP award in 1993 and was named to the NBA’s 50th and 75th anniversary teams.\\n   \\n      Since retiring, Barkley has built a successful media career, but had briefly hinted at a possible switch to politics, expressing an interest in becoming the governor of Alabama.\\n   \\n      However, the NBA legend said he was, and is still, uninspired by the major political forces in the US.\\n   \\n      “I consider myself an Independent because I hate the words Republican, Democratic, Conservative and Liberal,” he said.\\n   \\n      “I think you can be one of those things, but you don’t think that way on every subject.\\n   \\n      “I really thought hard about running for governor but then I realized, like, I don’t think either one of these parties are really concerned about people and that’s what America is: people.”\\n   \\n      Barkley said he was equally unimpressed about next year’s US election, which may once again be fought between US President Joe Biden and previous incumbent Donald Trump, saying he didn’t “feel good about a rematch.”\\n   \\n      While not afraid to delve into the world of politics, Barkley still holds a deep love for the game of basketball.\\n   \\n      It’s a sport which gave him the platform to speak about matters he’s passionate about and a career which changed the entire trajectory of his family’s life.\\n   \\n      “I wanted to be successful,” he said, looking back at what inspired him at the start of his playing career. “You know, basketball, it meant so much to me.”\\n   \\n      “I think about my life. I’m from a small town of a couple thousand people. My mom was a maid, my grandmother worked in a meat factory. You know, I grew up in the projects.\\n   \\n      “All I had to do was be good at basketball and I was able to change the entire dynamics of my life and my family’s life. I was thinking about that the whole time.\\n   \\n      “I don’t want to be poor anymore. All I got to do is rebound and the rest is history,” added Barkley, who has donated millions of dollars to a number of causes, including supporting historically Black colleges in the US.\\n   \\n      With the new NBA season back underway, Barkley isn’t shy about predicting this year’s champion.\\n   \\n      “The Boston Celtics,” he said, with his trademark confidence.\\n   \\n      Barkley’s new CNN show, ‘King Charles,’ is set to start this fall and continue into 2024.\\n   \\nThe full interview on “Who’s Talking to Chris Wallace” is streaming now on Max.\\n',\n",

       "  'contents': ' \\n      Newcastle United and Italy midfielder Sandro Tonali has been banned for 10 months for violating betting regulations, the president of the Italian Football Federation (FIGC), Gabriele Gravina, said on Thursday.\\n   \\n      “The agreement has already been reached between the Federal Prosecutor’s Office and Sandro Tonali, which occurred before the referral, therefore it must be endorsed by the undersigned, which I have already done,” said Gravina after leaving the 23-year-old player’s hearing as filmed by a number of Italian media outlets, including CNN affiliate Sky24.\\n   \\n      Tonali, who joined Newcastle from AC Milan in July, will be unavailable for both club and country until August next year, meaning he would be unavailable to represent Italy’s men’s national team at the 2024 Euros if the Azzurri successfully qualify.\\n   \\n      Tonali’s representatives were in Italy to negotiate a plea deal on his behalf. Tonali has not publicly commented on the case.\\n   \\n      CNN has reached out to Tonali’s lawyers and agency for comment.\\n   \\n      Ahead of Newcastle’s Premier League game against Crystal Palace last Saturday, the club’s manager Eddie Howe told the BBC that Tonali had been “handling himself really well and is dealing with emotions incredibly strongly.”\\n   \\n      According to Gravina, the plea agreement reached between the player’s representatives and the federal prosecutor ensures a reduced punishment for the midfielder.\\n   \\n      Article 24 of the FIGC’s sporting justice code prohibits players from placing or taking bets on events organized by the FIGC, FIFA and UEFA. If a player is found to have breached the article, they can be punished with a three-year ban, but this can be reduced with a guilty plea.\\n   \\n      The 23-year-old will also undergo a therapy plan for gambling issues – which his lawyers said were connected to gambling addiction, according to Reuters – as well as making 16 speaking appearances as community service.\\n   \\n      Tonali signed for Newcastle in the summer for a reported fee of $74 million, per Reuters. This was a record sum for an Italian player.\\n   \\n      During his time with AC Milan, Tonali helped the club win its first Serie A title in 11 years in the 2021/22 season and reach last season’s Champions League semifinals.\\n   \\n      Tonali came on as a second-half substitute in Newcastle’s Champions League defeat to Borussia Dortmund on Wednesday.\\n   \\n      The decision comes just weeks after Juventus midfielder Nicolò Fagioli was handed a seven-month ban and fined €12,500 ($13,200) for also breaching betting rules.\\n   \\n      The 22-year-old Fagioli also has to undergo gambling therapy and attend “at least 10 public meetings” to speak as part of his treatment.\\n   \\n      Tonali and his fellow Italy international teammate Nicolò Zaniolo withdrew from the national team squad earlier this month after their involvement in gambling investigations was released.

       " {'headline': '\\n      How the battle for golf’s soul gave Tiger Woods new-found purpose – and human connection\\n    ',\n",
       "  'contents': ' \\nTiger Woods has made so many comebacks in his extraordinary golfing career that they have become an integral part of his legend.\\n   \\n      But after his 2021 high-speed, single-car accident in the Los Angeles suburbs, even Woods must have known that a serious comeback was unlikely. His right leg had been smashed to pieces, and he was lucky that it was still attached to the rest of his body.\\n   \\n      What the 15-time major champion needed now wasn’t so much a comeback in a competitive sense but rather a way back onto the course. Renowned golf writer Alan Shipnuck believes that the emergence of the Saudi-backed LIV Golf tour provided Woods with the most unlikely of pathways.\\n   \\n      “This battle for the soul of professional golf gave Tiger a purpose,” Shipnuck told CNN Sport. “It gave him a rallying cry. He was this galvanizing figure for the PGA Tour, fighting for its legacy.”\\n   \\n      In the spring and summer of 2022, men’s professional golf had been plunged into a crisis. As the game’s biggest stars were being tempted by guaranteed salaries well into eight figures, the game was cleaved into a world of “haves and have-mores,” as Shipnuck described it.\\n   \\n      As the battlelines were drawn and the rhetoric became increasingly heated, Woods arrived on the scene as the game’s elder statesman, eager to make a stand for golfing heritage.\\n   \\n      Fighting back from injury, divorce, and scandal, Woods’ headlines had been less about golf for those who weren’t around for his golden years. He won the Masters in 2019, but that was 11 years after his previous major win.\\n   \\n      “Tiger’s always been a loner,” Shipnuck explained. “He’s always been an introvert, and there’s entire generations that don’t know him at all because he’s been injured for so long.”\\n   \\n      But that began to change after Woods flew into Delaware to head up an impromptu players’ meeting, at which they all thrashed out a new direction for the PGA Tour.\\n   \\n      “I really think it’s been a crucial part of Tiger’s road back from that accident, to have more human connection and to feel the love and the warm embrace of his colleagues. I don’t think you can overstate how important that that this has been for Tiger.\\n   \\n      “We may ultimately have to thank LIV Golf for giving us a new, improved, and more engaged Tiger Woods!”\\n   \\n      Shipnuck’s new book, “LIV And Let Die,” chronicles the tumultuous emergence of the breakaway tour.\\n   \\n      Australian two-time major champion Greg Norman emerges as the chief provocateur in the book, whose long-standing desire to shake up the game was re-energized by the seemingly limitless reserves of Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund.\\n   \\n      It’s a compelling read, littered with so much profanity that it sometimes reads more like a screenplay for a Quentin Tarantino movie than a book about a traditionally genteel sport.\\n   \\n      Two of the 62 f**ks in the book come from five-time major champion Brooks Koepka, who joined the LIV Tour in the summer of June, 2022.\\n   \\n      “F**k all of those country club kids who talk sh*t about me,” Koepka is quoted as saying, “You think I give a f**k what they think about me? You think I care what people say about me? I had three surgeries and I’m supposed to turn down $130 million? I grew up with nothing.”\\n   \\n      Shipnuck accepts that the colorful language speaks to the highly charged emotions on both sides.\\n   \\n      “I never think it’s my job to edit someone’s language, if they’re fired up and if they have something that they want to say forcefully, then I just let it go,” adds Shipnuck.\\n   \\n      “The passions were so inflamed, it became very personal to the players, to the executives, and to the money guys behind the scenes. It took some time to get people to really talk honestly like they did, including those four-letter words!”\\n   \\n      Shipnuck says that he spoke with players, caddies, CEOs, agents, financiers, lawyers, fans and wives for his book, but it has not been well received by everybody.\\n   \\n      Writing on the X platform, formerly known as Twitter, two-time major champion Justin Thomas said: “I’d like to speak on behalf of a lot of tour players and say we’re sick of @AlanShipnuck doing what he does.\\n   \\n      “Bring positivity and good stories to help grow the game of golf, not try and make money bashing guys, earning zero trust, with a lot of incorrect information. Ridiculous.”\\n   \\n      Shipnuck has defended his work, telling CNN that he’s not a “publicist, I’m a journalist.”\\n   \\n      “My obligation’s to the reader, not to the players,” Shipnuck adds. “They count on me to give them the truth and tell them what’s really happening behind the scenes.\\n   \\n      “When you do that, you offer this counter-narrative for what the players want to believe, what they’ve been told by their leadership, what’s in their best interest; they sometimes get upset about it. I feel that it’s really their problem, not mine.”\\n   \\n      Shipnuck describes the overarching themes of the narrative are loyalty and betrayal, vengeance and greed, but there’s much more nuance than might have seemed apparent at the time.\\n   \\n      Rory McIlroy, whose full-throated and principled defense of the PGA Tour earned him a badge of honor in the esteem of many, was seen as “the moral conscience of golf.” But Shipnuck hints that perhaps it wasn’t quite so black-and-white.\\n   \\n      “Rory also emerged as the leading troll,” Shipnuck tells CNN. “Rory was a great ambassador for the tour, but he made it very personal.\\n   \\n      “And the LIV players rolled their eyes about Rory being held up as this white knight because Rory has tremendous business interests through the PGA Tour that he’s also fighting to protect.”\\n   \\n      Equally, perhaps there was more to the so-called villains than first met the eye.\\n   \\n      “It misses all the nuance to say they just sold out and took the money,” says Shipnuck. “I mean, obviously, the money was an inducement. Everybody understands that. But there were more things going on.”\\n   \\n      Shipnuck explains that 2020 US Open champion Bryson DeChambeau, a young man in his prime, was one of the more surprising players to join LIV.\\n   \\n      In the book, a narrative emerges that indicates the American player felt undervalued by his peers on the PGA Tour. Shipnuck told CNN of the pain in DeChambeu’s voice as he spoke about it, writing:\\n   \\n      “He told me that, six years in a row, he tried to get elected to the player Advisory Council on the PGA Tour. It’s like running for president when you’re in high school, but for six years in a row, his peers rejected him. He had real pain in his voice when he told me, ‘I guess they just don’t like me.’”\\n   \\n      Once he’d joined the LIV Tour, DeChambeau assumed a leadership position as a team captain.\\n   \\n      “Patrick Reed and Sergio García had worn out their welcome on the PGA Tour. They were disliked by their peers; they were feuding with the leadership. LIV was just a fresh start, a new organization that caters to the players and has a different mentality.\\n   \\n      “Phil Mickelson needed to be validated as the smartest guy in the room. All of them wanted the money, clearly, but there’s a lot more at play. The ‘good guys’ always have a little shadow, and with the ‘bad guys,’ there’s usually a redeeming quality or two.”\\n   \\n      Ultimately, for all the bitterness and acrimony, it could be that all the players will end up on the same side.\\n   \\n      Almost exactly a year to the day since LIV played its inaugural tournament in London, PGA Tour Commissioner Jay Monahan and PIF Governor Yasir Al-Rumayyan revealed that they had brokered a surprise truce and settled their lawsuits.\\n \\n      While the full details have yet to be hammered out, the pair announced that, along with the European Tour, they would join up to create an entity that would unify the game.\\n   \\n      “They all doubled and tripled their salaries,” Shipnuck explained. “One of Phil Mickelson’s primary complaints was that the PGA Tour was sitting on a lot of money that belonged to the players. You could say he was vindicated in that regard.”\\n   \\n      The fans could also win, as a result.\\n   \\n      “If they can create a schedule where you take maybe the best dozen PGA Tour events, the best five or six on the European tour, and two or three LIV events and you put this together in a way that makes sense geographically and throughout the year – and all the best players will always show up – that would be a huge win for golf fans,” according to Shipnuck.\\n   \\n      Assuming the Saudis remain involved with the project, it would also be a win for them.\\n   \\n      To take a seat at the table of a major international sport and walk the corridors of power and influence in the western world after emerging from the shadow of their alleged involvement in 9/11, the murder of Jamal Khashoggi and a poor human rights record would be a significant coup.\\n   \\n      Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has previously said he doesn’t “care” about the country’s investment in sport being described as sportswashing.\\n   \\n      “Well if sportswashing is going to increase my GDP by one percent, then I will continue doing sportswashing,” MBS said in an\\xa0interview\\xa0with Fox News which aired in September.\\n   \\n      The LIV episode is proof, Shipnuck argues, that sportswashing works.\\n   \\n      “In the first year of LIV, the players were pounded with questions about Khashoggi, about [Crown Prince] Mohammad Bin Salman, about the human rights abuses of the Saudi government against its own citizens. And by year two, those questions started to disappear because fatigue sets in.\\n   \\n      “That’s why sportswashing is so popular among certain bad actors because it does have that effect over time. You normalize these countries.\\n   \\n      “Over time, the resistance starts to fade away and there does become this acceptance that they’re part of professional sports or part of the global economy. And, maybe, they are our allies.”\\n   \\n      CNN has reached out to Woods, McIroy, Reed and Garcia for comment.\\n  ',\n",

It felt like a real opportunity for me.”\\n   \\n      In the years since, Klum has spent hundreds of hours in, and likely hundreds of thousands of dollars on, hair, makeup and prosthetics preparing for her star-studded festivities, dedicated to her goal of doing for Halloween what nobody has dared do before.\\n   \\n      “I have sleepless nights over Halloween; you have no idea,” Klum told People magazine earlier this month. “I can’t rehearse this; it’s only on the day. I always hope that it works out.”\\n   \\n      Musing over what her next costume will be often begins the day after Halloween, she told THR, because of both enthusiasm and needing ample time to construct such elaborate costumes.\\n   \\n      We’ve yet to see what Klum has up her sleeve this spooky season, though she did tell Entertainment Tonight that “it’s going to be very colorful, and super big.” For now, then, here are some of her most iconic Halloween looks from years past — from 2022 dating back to the early aughts.\\n   \\n      Last Halloween, Klum wriggled and writhed into her annual party as a very realistic earthworm, with only her eyes peeking through the sculptural worm-suit itself. (She later changed into a sheer bedazzled bodysuit for the party — lest she be limited to doing the worm on the dance floor — but left her facial prothesis on.)\\n   \\n      Klum’s husband Tom Kaulitz accompanied her on the red carpet dressed as a fisherman with a ghoulish twist — a prosthetic eyeball hanging from his socket.\\n   \\n      Perhaps one of Klum’s creepiest costumes, her 2019 look saw her dressed in a head-to-toe bodysuit resembling a decomposing body — scarred and visceral, flayed in parts and with an exposed brain — seemingly revivified by cables and other surgical bits.\\n   \\n      Klum and Kaulitz — a zombified astronaut, naturally — arrived together in a biohazard truck.\\n   \\n      In 2018 Klum and Kaulitz dressed as animated movie stars Fiona and Shrek, respectively, in costumes so realistic it was as if they had walked off a character parade float at Universal Studios.\\n   \\n      Back in 2017, Klum paid homage to Michael Jackson’s “Thriller” music video by recreating the werewolf look Jackson transformed into in the music video’s movie-within-a-movie opening scene. As well as meticulously copying the clothes Jackson wore in the video, the costume\\xa0also incorporated prosthetics, so Klum’s werewolf face moved with her own features. (Klum’s zombie entourage, also pictured above, referenced the second horror movie trope referenced in “Thriller.”)\\n   \\n      Technically this wasn’t a costume “on” Klum, because she came to her party dressed as herself.

The costume’s two hours-long removal at the end of the night — which cost her some of her own skin — called for a nail polish remover-like substance and a chisel, Klum told People magazine.\\n   \\n      As a longtime Victoria’s Secret Angel, Klum had spent years wearing wings for the lingerie brand’s annual Fashion Show, but never ones quite like this. For her 2014 party, Klum become a butterfly — with wings hand-painted by artisans who’d worked on Victoria’s Secret Angels’ wings. Her glowing bugs’ eyes were powered by batteries placed inside the mask, near her real eyes.\\n   \\n      Klum aged herself by a few decades for this Halloween costume. From head to toe, she was made unrecognizable with layers upon layers of makeup and prosthetics that gave her wrinkles, sagging skin, age spots and yellow teeth. (Nonetheless, she donned an elegant tweed twinset, paired with a paisley blouse, pearls and a tan handbag.)\\n   \\n      “Just going into my future is what I wanted to do for myself,” she told Yahoo Entertainment in 2022. “I wanted to, like, look in the mirror and be like, ‘OK, I want to see, you know, what I might look like when I’m like in my 80s.”\\n   \\n      A predecessor of sorts to her alien zombie look, Klum in 2011 wore a body suit (and matching face paint) designed to look like the human body sans skin. She made a grand entrance to her first of two parties that year in Las Vegas rolling in on a gurney pushed by two people dressed as bloody doctors.\\n   \\n      But that wasn’t all — in her second look for a party in New York City, Klum and then-husband Seal donned outfits inspired by the “Planet of the Apes” films.\\n   \\n      “We didn’t really think about, you know, going to the bathroom,” Klum told Yahoo Entertainment of the costumes. “It was very tricky.”\\n   \\n      In preparation for her red and purple costume that transformed her into a “Transformers”-worthy robot, for days Klum practiced walking on stilts in her backyard, she told People magazine. “It was amazing, though, because I was so tall and I could just tower over everyone,” Klum said — until she’d had a few drinks.\\n   \\n      Then nine months pregnant with her third child, Klum and then-husband Seal dressed as the biblical forbidden fruit (wrapped by the serpent, no less) and Eve, respectively. The original sin here, though, is the lack of effort put into Seal’s ensemble.\\n   \\n      In a testament to just how over-the-top Klum’s costumes have become, it’s telling that her 2004 look — a sexy vampire witch costume which featured a voluminous wig, oversize witch’s hat, knee-high boots and blood red makeup — now seems positively understated. “I was rigged from the ceiling and then I was flying over all the people like ‘Happy Halloween ha ha ha’ on my broom with a skeleton on my back,” she told People of her grand entrance to that year’s party.\\n   \\n      Since she wanted a full, realistic skeleton, Klum bought one from a supply store for doctor’s office materials.\\n   \\n      At her 2003 party, Klum made her arrival by exiting a golden spaceship, dressed as a cyberpunk-style golden alien. Reminiscent also of the Grecian god Hermes, her look featured gold armor and boots with leaf accents, golden belt detailing, gold body glitter, a golden grill and gold ribbons woven into her long braids.\\n   \\n      In 2001, Klum dressed as the 11th-century Anglo-Saxon gentlewoman Lady Godiva. Though the eponymous legend told of Godiva’s naked ride through the English town of Coventry on horseback, Klum covered up, wearing a white bodysuit with crystalline detailing. She added a long blonde wig.\\n   \\n      “I was always looking for something that I hadn’t seen, and so I was Lady Godiva,” Klum told People magazine.\\xa0“I came on a horse, obviously.

       " {'headline': '\\n      The Filipino American creatives who are reclaiming the barong\\n    ',\n",
       "  'contents': ' \\nEditor’s Note:\\xa0This feature is part of CNN Style’s series\\xa0Hyphenated, which explores the complex issue of identity among minorities in the United States.\\n \\nCNN — As a first-generation child of Filipino American immigrants, I grew up with wistful stories my parents told of their homeland, rich in details from their childhoods spent in a country that seemed as foreign to me as the fictitious lands described in fairytales. These stories were told in a tone that encapsulated both a yearning to seize opportunity in the West and for a life where they didn’t feel like outsiders — where conformity to American culture was not a daily burden.\\n   \\n      Many of these stories centered on my paternal great uncle, Philippine President Ramon Magsaysay, and his role cementing the barong Tagalog, a sheer button-down shirt often emblazoned with hand stitched embroidery, as the country’s official formal wear.\\n   \\n      More recently, the barong Tagalog — which translates loosely to “dress of the Philippines” and is often abbreviated to barong — has surged in popularity with Filipinos across the diaspora as a point of national pride and style.\\n   \\n      “(The barong) is inherently so glamorous,” explained wardrobe stylist and fashion editor Rap Sarmiento. “With its sheerness and embroidery, it lends itself to the moment. Second generation kids are embracing this.”\\n   \\n      The origins of the barong are widely seen as dating back to times before the Philippines was colonized by Spain in the 15th century. Both a status symbol and everyday garment, its sheer fabric has been explained as either a practical design choice, to deal with the intense heat and humidity of the Philippines, or one borne of oppression, with Spanish colonizers wanting to ensure Filipino natives could not steal items or conceal weapons under their clothes.\\n   \\n      “The Spanish took (the barong) to all of their colonies… other countries have their own versions,” said Caroline Mangosing, founder and designer of Vinta Gallery, a Canadian-based brand that specializes in Filipino clothing. “Cuba has the guayabera with pockets. The Dominican Republic has a version with pleating.”\\n   \\n      During his 1953 inauguration, President Magsaysay wore a barong to show solidarity with the common man. It sparked wide acceptance of the shirt as the Philippines’ answer to a formal suit or tuxedo, and became a garment which struck a strong contrast to westernized suits and ties on the global stage.\\n   \\n      The inauguration marked one of many times President Magsaysay used the barong as a signal toward Philippine independence and resilience, in the period after the nearly 50-year colonization of the country by the United States had come to an end. Supporting his Filipino First Policy to strengthen and grow the economy, the President and his administration invested in garment manufacturing and textile mills, with many using the native materials from which barongs are traditionally made — piña (pineapple fiber) abaca (hemp) and jusi (piña and hemp combined), in turn stoking local industry and the general Filipino public’s interest in native garments made from native fibers\\xa0— said his son (and my uncle), former Senator of the Philippines Ramon Magsaysay Jr.\\n   \\n      “He was committed to supporting Filipino nationalism for our country and people,” Magsaysay Jr. said. “(During his inauguration), we could see him proudly showing his Filipino-made clothing and shoes to a big crowd.”\\n   \\n      The barong’s evolution following Magsaysay’s presidency is also as compelling as its colorful and complicated past. President Ferdinand Marcos’ use of the garment, for example, saw its popularity wane among many Filipinos over time.\\n   \\n      “There was a political hangover. People didn’t want to be like them,” said Mangosing of Marcos and his wife Imelda, whose predilection for Filipiniana (traditional women’s dress) also saw the fashions go out of style once they were exiled from the country. “After that, I feel like everyone stopped wearing barongs for a while, so it stopped evolving — what remained were mass-market versions in garish colors.”\\n   \\n      But as more Filipinos have permeated fashion, music and pop culture at large in the United States (and around the world) in recent years, the barong has bounced back in ways that are strikingly creative, individual and inspiring.\\n   \\n      Vinta Gallery’s barongs, which are handmade and embroidered at an atelier in the Philippines, range from $300 to $600 for a ready-to-wear version and can swing north of $1000 for custom. They are among the brand’s most popular items, Mangosing told CNN, particularly those embroidered with anting-anting or other charms based on Philippine folk magic.\\n   \\n      Last year, Jian DeLeon, men’s fashion director at Nordstrom, collaborated with the menswear label Bode on a shirt inspired by a traditional barong, but made from a non-traditional cotton linen blend fabric.\\n   \\n      “I took inspiration from when French designer Pierre Cardin redesigned the (shirt) silhouette in the 1970s,” De Leon said.\\xa0“Cardin added touches like a camp collar and French cuffs and embraced a more global style of embroidery. I think these are the kinds of projects that can put these inherently Filipino fashion items into a global context.”\\n   \\n      Attending a Nike “Filipino Forces” dinner in Los Angeles last fall, an event celebrating Filipino Americans working in music, fashion and entertainment, Sarmiento wore his father’s barong over a t-shirt from Rhude, a black tennis skirt and black Margiela Tabi boots. “It was a way to bring it forward,” said the stylist.\\n   \\n      At the same event, designer and influencer Aleali May wore a barong with distressed jeans, hoop earrings and limited-edition Nike Air Force One sneakers.\\n   \\n      “When I first started in music, I was usually the only Filipino at events, and now it’s typical to see 3 or 4 of us, so it’s not unusual to see a barong being worn,” said music executive Marisa Pizarro. “It’s an elevated look without having to wear a suit. You rarely see suits (in creative industries) anymore.”\\n   \\n      Other Filipino-American celebrities have recently opted to don a barong both on red carpets and other highly visible events. Last year, Levi’s created a custom-made denim barong for Jo Koy, juxtaposing the traditional garment’s fabrics with the cut of a trucker jacket. Covering the opening night of Broadway musical “Here Lies Love” for Vogue Philippines, photographer Martin Romero noted that, “a lot of the men, specifically the cast members, and a lot of the guests, wore traditional and modern barongs.” Likewise, the barong has become increasingly ubiquitous among Gen Z on social media, with young people wearing brands like Vinta Gallery and The Mestizo on their Instagram and TikTok feeds.\\n   \\n      NBA players Klay Thompson and Kevon Looney — who are not Filipino — recently wore barongs during their Asia tour as ambassadors for athletic brand Anta. “It looks wonderful. And feels even better, too,” Thompson told Esquire Philippines of the garment. It was a gesture the magazine described as a “Pinoy Pride moment.”\\n   \\n      “It’s a combination of social media and awareness of Filipino culture — wanting to wear traditional garb to show off our culture,” said entrepreneur Rembrandt Flores. “Younger people’s interest is piqued and they are choosing to wear the barong as a source of pride and sartorial creativity.”\\n  ',\n",

       " {'headline': '\\n      The photographer taking couple selfies to the extreme\\n    ',\n",
       "  'contents': ' \\n      In one of Pixy Liao’s photographs, she wrestles with her boyfriend Moro in a hotel room; in another, she flings his naked body over her shoulder and carries him in the way a fireman might rescue someone.\\n   \\n      The images form part of her ongoing project “Experimental Relationship” — first profiled by CNN in 2019 — which began in 2007, a year after she met Moro. The series  playfully explores the intimacy and dynamics of being in a long-term relationship.\\n   \\n      When I meet Liao, she and Moro are crouching in picturesque window arches at La Residencia hotel,\\xa0overlooking the beautiful countryside of the Spanish island of Mallorca. As she\\xa0carefully orchestrates images of the two of them —\\xa0standing, sitting, pointing, holding a mirror to the camera — a nearby couple takes smartphone selfies in the sunshine, kissing. Liao is undertaking a two-month residency here in the art-steeped mountain town of Deià to continue “Experimental Relationship.” Naturally, Moro is along for the ride.\\n   \\n      Liao met Moro — five years her junior — at the University of Memphis, Tennessee, where she studied photography. When she started to take pictures of him, it\\xa0became a vehicle to explore what kind of relationship she wanted — and her own identity.\\xa0“Growing up in China, I didn’t see any examples of female role models that I wanted to be,” she said, sitting in her temporary studio at\\xa0the hotel. “It was like being the second best or supporting role, and I didn’t understand why it had to be that way.”\\n   \\n      Liao is expert at balancing the banal with the erotic, and exploring the power dynamics at play when humans engage in physical and emotional intimacy. In early photographs, Liao appears in a position of domination; deploying the female gaze and exerting power over Moro. One image (“Start your day\\xa0with a\\xa0good breakfast together,” 2009) shows Liao eating breakfast off Moro’s naked body, staring into the camera, as he lies awkwardly on the kitchen table.\\n   \\n      But as her and Moro’s relationship evolved, so did the project. “As we grow older together, our relationship changes,” she explained. The tongue-in-cheek eroticism is still\\xa0there, as is the playful subversion, but in more recent photographs, Moro plays a more active role, in and out of the picture.\\xa0“He’s really involved in the creation process,” Liao said. “He sometimes knows what I want before I do.” It is often Moro, rather than Liao, operating the remote cable release control to take the photograph. Part of this, Liao explained, is about “sharing power with him.”\\n   \\n      Does the project cause tensions in their relationship? Liao doesn’t think so, but noted that it’s hard to work on the project when they’re fighting. “He refuses to collaborate with me,” she said. “My main task in life is to keep a good relationship with him,” she added, laughing.\\n   \\n      Liao believes the two most important things for “Experimental Relationship” are the ideas and the locations. The ideas — from making a naked Moro into human sushi, to screaming at each other, to bending over in underpants and peeking between their legs — are steeped in a kind-of fantasy. “It’s not exactly us, it’s another pair of us in a parallel universe that’s kind-of similar, but maybe something we would never do in real life,” she said. “It’s like a role-playing game.”\\n   \\n      The settings, meanwhile, shape the feel of the images. Liao looks for locations imbued with a sense that “stories can happen there.” We often see the couple in domestic interiors,\\xa0whether a bare-walled, drab house or a slick New York loft. But the series also transports us to more surprising settings: a rural hotel in Japan; a peaceful forest in Woodstock, New York.\\n   \\n      Liao doesn’t want the locations to be “too beautiful,” she said, so while in Deià\\xa0she has been looking for things that are “a little weird,” like a gnarled olive tree trunk with holes that she and Moro could poke their faces through.\\xa0The concept of play infuses much of her work. “Fun is the most important thing for me,” Liao said. “My priority is to satisfy myself, to entertain myself.”\\n   \\n      After her residency completes at the end of October — the last of a series of three this summer for the hotel, also including Anastasiia Podervianska and Sislej Xhafa — Liao will return home to Brooklyn with Moro. The work she creates will go on show in the hotel once it reopens for the 2024 season next March. And what of the future of “Experimental Relationship” — is there a planned end to the project? “I definitely want to do it as long as we’re together,” she said, smiling. With that, she goes off into the idyllic landscape on another photo shoot with Moro, living out their fantasies.\\n  ',\n",

       " {'headline': '\\n      This faux-leather jacket is made by bacteria\\n    ',\n",
       "  'contents': ' \\n      What do you get when you feed bacteria with industrial fruit waste? “A yellow leather jacket” might not be your first answer, but it’s exactly what came out of a collaboration between Danish fashion brand Ganni and Mexican biomaterials company Polybion.\\n   \\n      The blazer — a one-of-a-kind prototype that is meant as a proof of concept for future collections — is made from bacterial cellulose, and rather than trying to replicate the characteristics of leather, it’s designed to feel like an entirely new material.\\n   \\n      “We were impressed by the fact that a lot of people love the jacket because the material did not resemble leather,” said Alexis Gómez-Ortigoza, Polybion’s co-founder. “It’s really easy to recognize that this is not leather — but also that it’s not plastic. It has a unique feel to it.”\\n   \\n      Although it is produced using some of the methods associated with traditional leather, the blazer has a much smaller carbon footprint, without compromising on strength and breathability, say its creators. “This is the first jacket ever made by a global brand out of bacterial nanocellulose,” added Gómez-Ortigoza, “So it is a pretty important milestone for the biomaterials industry.”\\n   \\n      Gómez-Ortigoza, whose background is in finance, founded Polybion in 2014 with his brother, Axel, whose background is in biotechnology. Together with friend and materials scientist Bárbara González Rolón, they initially focused on mycelium, a root-like network of fungal threads, and opened a pilot plant for mycelium materials.\\n   \\n      Then, something peculiar happened. “About five years ago, a friend of mine stepped into my office and he showed me a kombucha jar,” recalled Gómez-Ortigoza. “We isolated our first bacteria from that drink.”\\n   \\n      Kombucha is an increasingly popular fermented tea drink, and the bacterial biomass used to make the jacket, called Celium, comes from that jar. Since then, Polybion has almost entirely pivoted to bacterial fermentation, as it deemed it a promising new source for a high-performance leather alternative.\\n   \\n      To feed the bacteria, Polybion uses scraps sourced from local canned fruit production plants, mainly from mangoes. “We feed the bacteria with fruit waste, which is extremely abundant here in central Mexico,” said Gómez-Ortigoza. “We turn it into food for the bacteria by adding a special formula developed by us that converts it into a growth medium.\\n   \\n      “The bacteria will then reproduce and generate the nanocellulose matrix as a metabolic byproduct, which we harvest after two weeks and then send through a tanning and finishing procedure.”\\n   \\n      The fruit waste would otherwise end up in a landfill, where it would decompose and generate methane — a greenhouse gas 25 times more powerful than carbon dioxide at trapping heat. Some producers, according to Gómez-Ortigoza, also burn or dump the waste illegally. The production of Celium creates about one quarter of the emissions compared to the greenest methods of leather production, and after factoring in the emissions avoided by rescuing the fruit waste, the process becomes carbon negative, Gómez-Ortigoza said.\\n   \\n      Once the nanocellulose is harvested, it is treated using techniques employed by local tanneries. “We use the same equipment as animal leather tanneries, but without chromium or any toxic chemicals,” said Gómez-Ortigoza. “Since this material is organic, it has a natural feel to it — it breathes and wears out in a similar way to leather. This is really important, especially for luxury brands.”\\n   \\n      Polybion is exploring the possibility of using Celium to make something other than textiles, including cardboard, thread, construction wood, and even wound dressings. “It has the potential to become a commodity, a widespread material for a different range of applications,” Gómez-Ortigoza added. “But as of right now, we are focused on a leather alternative, because we believe this application has the shortest time to market.”\\n   \\n      If you want to buy a bacterial jacket, you’ll have to wait just a little bit longer. “The blazer is a one-of-a-kind piece and unfortunately not for sale,” said Lauren Bartley, Ganni’s Sustainability and CSR Director. Ganni, which has committed to a 50% absolute carbon reduction for its operations by 2027, is working with other new types of fabric, with the aim of making 10% of its main collection from them by 2025. However, the company will be selling garments made from Celium in 2024.\\n   \\n      The design of the blazer is the same silhouette that Ganni successfully featured in previous collections using traditional materials — worn by Michelle Obama in an organic cotton version, Bartley says. “We went for a yellow color to give it the same bright feeling and impact as the versions of the blazer in bright pink and green made in wool in previous collections,” she adds.\\n   \\n      Polybion is planning similar projects with other fashion brands, although it won’t reveal the names yet. “All I can say that we are working with the biggest sportswear company in the world as well as three of the most important luxury fashion houses from France,” said Gómez-Ortigoza, adding that he expects to announce these in detail next year.\\n   \\n      Fashion houses are increasingly exploring innovative materials as a way to make their garments more sustainable. “The textile industry is looking to agricultural and food waste as a viable raw material for this new material revolution in response to the climate crisis, making better use of planetary resources without the need to use virgin ones,” said Kate Goldsworthy, a professor of Circular Design and Innovation at the University of the Arts London, who’s not involved with Polybion.\\n   \\n      “Textiles made from cellulose are certainly not new, but a growing range of innovative companies are finding new ways to produce cellulose fibers from waste streams. Polybion have considered the environment in every aspect of their production, and the supply chain is contained within a 30-mile radius, taking local production seriously,” she said, adding that the challenge is now scaling up production and getting consumers to embrace the materials as well.\\n   \\n      According to Kate Fletcher, a professor at the Royal Danish Academy, Copenhagen and Oslo Metropolitan University in Norway, while alternative materials like Celium are a welcome addition to the range of fabrics promising lower-impact clothing, this will never address the root cause of the sustainability challenge for fashion.\\n   \\n      “This challenge lies elsewhere: in addressing the year-on-year growth in scale of the fashion sector and reducing overproduction, without which impacts will continue to rise regardless of what material we make garments in,” she said.\\n  ',\n",

       "  'contents': ' \\n      On October 20, 1973 — exactly 50 years ago this Friday — the Sydney Opera House was opened to great fanfare by the late Queen Elizabeth II.\\n   \\n      Completed a decade late and vastly over-budget, the unusual-looking building was not an immediate hit with Australians. Yet, in the decades since, its striking shell-shaped roof helped it become an architectural icon and an UNESCO World Heritage Site that attracts over 10 million visitors a year.\\n   \\n      How different things might have been.\\n   \\n      Danish architect Jørn Utzon’s successful proposal was just one of 233 entries in an international design competition. Launched in 1955 by\\xa0New South Wales premier Joseph Cahill, who was a long-time advocate of transforming the site of an old tram depot into an opera house, the contest attracted participants from over 30 different counties.\\n   \\n      A document outlining the competition criteria, known as the “Brown Book,” described certain architectural requirements: The building would, for instance,\\xa0need a main hall capable of accommodating 3,000 to 3,500 people (though the final building has a capacity of under 2,700) and parking space for 100 cars. The document also addressed issues like ventilation and exit passageways. But, otherwise, designers were encouraged to indulge their imaginations\\xa0— with organizers\\xa0setting no limit for how much money proposals might cost to realize.\\n   \\n      Entrants were asked only for black and white drawings, including floor plans and diagrams, as well as a report that “should be as concise as possible, explaining only matters which cannot be readily explained on the drawings,” the Brown Book reads. So, in 2019, creative studio NeoMam Studios and now-defunct architecture firm Projection Comunicación Arquitectónica set about researching the entries and visualizing, in full color, how some of the proposals might have looked.\\n   \\n      They picked seven from the 232 unsuccessful entries — a selection process based both on the merits of the submissions and the amount of information available to researchers.\\n   \\n      “Some of them had a story, some of them were ones we knew we could do a good job with, and some were ones where we thought, ‘It would have been hilarious if they’d chosen something like this,’” NeoMam Studios’\\xa0CEO, Gisele Navarro,\\xa0recalled in a phone interview with CNN.\\n   \\n      And while Navarro concludes that competition judges ultimately “made the right choice,” she applauded some of the entrants’ “blue-sky thinking.”\\n   \\n      Quite how close any of these alternatives came to winning may be lost to history. But legend has it that Utzon’s winning design was initially dismissed, only to be saved from the reject pile by Finnish American architect Eero Saarinen, one of the judges.\\n   \\nHere are seven of the alternative designs that didn’t make the cut:\\n',\n",

UN peacekeepers had been deployed but were reluctant to use force to protect civilians, even after evidence surfaced that Bosnian Serbs had engaged in ethnic cleansing and genocide against Bosnian Muslims.\\n   \\n      The US decided it had to intervene after no other option had worked. Using a combination of aggressive diplomacy and the threat of additional NATO airstrikes against the Bosnian Serbs, Washington coordinated agreement on guiding principles for peace negotiations that took place in Dayton, Ohio.\\n   \\n      The US made sure that each party invited to the talks — Serbia, Croatia and the Bosnian Muslims — understood in no uncertain terms that there would be substantial costs for not cooperating.

But there are aspects of the US experience in Bosnia — beyond extreme highs and lows — that can provide guidance to navigating the current crisis. At Dayton, we refused to deal directly with the top Bosnian Serbs given their\\xa0direct role in atrocities, and\\xa0their\\xa0interests were represented by Belgrade. Similarly, Hamas’ current leadership would certainly not be welcome at the table should Mideast peace talks resume.\\n   \\n      In Bosnia, we developed strong incentives for each party to reach a deal, as well as disincentives for failure.

For any talks on Mideast peace, it will be just as crucial to identify important roles for Israel’s neighbors and the broader international community. This should include testing the willingness of Saudi Arabia to recognize Israel. Indeed, one major motive for Hamas’ attack appears to have been its aim to derail normalization.\\n   \\n      The United States will clearly need to galvanize a regional coalition in the Middle East, much as it did with the Bosnia Contact Group that\\xa0kept the EU and major European powers in sync with the pace of American-led efforts to end that war.\\n   \\n      In addition to the United States and Israel, such a Mideast contact group could include at its core Egypt and Jordan, as well as the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Saudi Arabia. Qatar, which is helping to mediate the return of additional hostages and has helped in other ways, could be offered a role provided it acts constructively.\\n   \\n      It remains to be seen if the Hamas attack will serve as a warning to the United States as it struggles to address internal tensions and remain a reliable international partner.

The longer the war in Gaza lasts, the greater the risk that Israel will lose some of the regional and international support that is essential to isolating Hamas, financially, militarily and politically.\\n   \\n      Of course,\\xa0given the threat that\\xa0Iran and groups like the Muslim Brotherhood pose to Egyptian and Gulf interests, these countries have as much to fear from a powerful Hamas as Israel. That should compel them to help increase isolation of Hamas as well as play an active and useful role in future peace talks.\\n   \\n      To maintain international support, but also as a matter of moral imperative, Israel must demonstrate that it is doing all that it can to uphold international humanitarian law, even as it wrestles with an enemy that places military assets\\xa0near civilian hospitals, schools and mosques\\xa0and that then\\xa0discourages civilians\\xa0from fleeing to safer ground.

It is time to take a hard look at concrete ways to bolster Palestinians who still seek peace and encourage the emergence of new leaders.\\n   \\n      The Palestinian Authority suffers from a myriad of problems but these do not diminish the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people— like Israelis, like Americans — to live in peace, with security and dignity. Israel, the United States, the European Union\\xa0 and — importantly — the Gulf states must do more in a coordinated way to address corruption, create economic opportunity and build the local Palestinian institutions needed for successful governance, not only in the West Bank but ultimately in Gaza. Otherwise there will be a political vacuum that the next iteration of Hamas, with\\xa0Iran’s backing, will exploit.\\n   \\n      A strong US commitment to negotiations, coupled with tangible support from regional players to fight Hamas and to build an effective Palestinian Authority, as well as the emergence of Israeli and Palestinian leaders who do support a two-state solution, provide hope that this terrible phase could sow the seeds for a better future.\\n   \\n      With the key players thinking strategically and acting tactically — as eventually happened in Bosnia — peace in the Middle East may have a chance.\\n  ',\n",

It is time to take a hard look at concrete ways to bolster Palestinians who still seek peace and encourage the emergence of new leaders.\\n   \\n      The Palestinian Authority suffers from a myriad of problems but these do not diminish the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people— like Israelis, like Americans — to live in peace, with security and dignity. Israel, the United States, the European Union\\xa0 and — importantly — the Gulf states must do more in a coordinated way to address corruption, create economic opportunity and build the local Palestinian institutions needed for successful governance, not only in the West Bank but ultimately in Gaza. Otherwise there will be a political vacuum that the next iteration of Hamas, with\\xa0Iran’s backing, will exploit.\\n   \\n      A strong US commitment to negotiations, coupled with tangible support from regional players to fight Hamas and to build an effective Palestinian Authority, as well as the emergence of Israeli and Palestinian leaders who do support a two-state solution, provide hope that this terrible phase could sow the seeds for a better future.\\n   \\n      With the key players thinking strategically and acting tactically — as eventually happened in Bosnia — peace in the Middle East may have a chance.\\n  ',\n",

       "  'contents': ' \\n  Editor’s Note: Charles Dunne is a former US Foreign Service officer. He is a nonresident fellow at the Arab Center Washington DC and a nonresident scholar at the Middle East Institute. He teaches\\xa0at the Elliott School of International Affairs at George Washington University.\\xa0The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View\\xa0more opinion\\xa0at CNN.\\n \\nThis piece has been updated to reflect news developments.\\n \\n      A total of\\xa021 US military personnel\\xa0have sustained injuries after coming\\xa0under attack 13 times\\xa0by aerial drones and rockets on\\xa0bases in Iraq and Syria last week,\\xa0defense officials\\xa0told CNN on Wednesday. The injuries might be minor, but the statement behind them isn’t:\\xa0The threat of a broader conflict, possibly involving US forces, is growing almost daily following the gruesome October 7 terrorist attacks on southern Israel by Hamas, the Iranian-supported militant group.\\n   \\n      Indeed, US troops in these locations have often been attacked by Iranian proxy forces at times of rising tension, and Washington, which believes Tehran has been “actively facilitating” these latest attacks, is bracing for a surge.\\xa0Fresh\\xa0US airstrikes\\xa0against\\xa0Iran-backed militia\\xa0targets in Syria on Thursday show\\xa0the United States is not backing\\xa0back down from this fight, and a sharper intensification\\xa0appears likely. However, the White House has, for the moment, rightly stopped short of concluding that a major escalation is inevitable.\\n   \\n      National Security Council spokesman John Kirby\\xa0told reporters\\xa0on Monday that the US is “deeply concerned about the potential for any significant escalation of these attacks in the days ahead,” and is positioning additional air defense forces,\\xa0two aircraft carrier strike groups and\\xa0some 900 additional troops\\xa0in the region as a deterrent.\\xa0President Joe Biden\\xa0himself has issued a starkly simple warning for any country or group that\\xa0might be looking to stir up more trouble: “Don’t.”\\n   \\n      That posture is about right: stern warnings\\xa0backed by a defensive buildup, which allows the US to make possible strikes against discrete targets if the origins of the attacks\\xa0can be identified in real time. The US should also make clear it retains the option to hit\\xa0the\\xa0facilities\\xa0of Iran-backed militias\\xa0responsible\\xa0in Syria and Iraq, as it did in 2021. While this risks escalation, it might be necessary\\xa0—\\xa0and a lack of resolve is also a risk in the face of ongoing attacks.\\n   \\n      In important respects, the Middle East of the moment resembles Europe on the eve of World War I, in which entangling alliances and secret commitments pushed a cascade of combatants to tumble together into war after the first shot was fired in Sarajevo.\\n   \\n      There is a history here that goes beyond the fact that the US is allied with and supporting Israel in its war on Hamas. Iran and the US have been on the brink of open conflict since early 2020 when the US\\xa0assassinated\\xa0the notorious commander of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards (IRGC) Qods Force, Qassem Soleimani, the man widely believed responsible for\\xa0enabling attacks against American troops throughout the region.\\n   \\n      Iran has a long memory, and earlier this year\\xa0renewed\\xa0its call for revenge. For months Tehran apparently has been planning a\\xa0more aggressive strategy\\xa0aimed at US troops in the region.\\n   \\n      Last February, Reuters reported that Iran used earthquake relief flights to Syria\\xa0as a cover\\xa0for secret weapons shipments, and The Washington Post reported that\\xa0documents\\xa0leaked as part of the\\xa0Discord trove\\xa0revealed plans by the IRGC Qods Force to equip and train militias with devastating\\xa0advanced IEDs.\\n   \\n      All this may be part of an effort coordinated among Russia, Iran and Syrian dictator\\xa0Bashar al-Assad to expel the\\xa0900 US troops in Syria, who are there to counter the Islamic State. The\\xa02,500 American troops\\xa0still in Iraq on an\\xa0advise-and-assist mission\\xa0will also present tempting targets.\\n   \\n      That means at the very least that\\xa0Iran is well-positioned to heighten already roiling tensions in the Middle East after spending decades\\xa0building a network of proxies and terror cells in Lebanon, Gaza, Iraq, Yemen and elsewhere to act as a forward line of defense for a clerical regime that sees itself as surrounded by external threats. Most important\\xa0—\\xa0especially in the case of Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in southern Lebanon\\xa0—\\xa0these furnish a direct front and capable forces in the armed fight for Israel’s destruction.\\n   \\n      But there’s also a deeper question of what exactly Iran did to bring about this crisis in the first place with the October 7 attacks\\xa0—\\xa0and what that says about where it goes from here.\\n   \\n      In Gaza, Iran has helped transform and expand the capabilities of Hamas (and its smaller cousin,\\xa0Palestinian Islamic Jihad, also involved in the recent attacks on Israel) almost since the group’s inception in 1987. Tehran has supplied a wide array of\\xa0rockets, missiles\\xa0and\\xa0other weapons, while Israeli intelligence has assessed that it manages a\\xa0sophisticated and complicated ratline\\xa0smuggling weaponry from Iran to Yemen to Sudan by sea, to Egypt by truck, through the Sinai courtesy of Bedouin smugglers, and from there into Gaza via Hamas’ extensive network of cross-border tunnels.\\xa0In addition, Iran has\\xa0provided Hamas up to $100 million\\xa0annually, according to a 2021 State Department report.\\n   \\n      Given that largess, some Biden opponents have charged that the $6 billion in\\xa0embargoed oil sales\\xa0“released” to Iran in exchange for\\xa0freeing five American hostages\\xa0in September played a role in financing the Hamas attack. But the\\xa0funds are held in an account\\xa0controlled by Qatar and carefully monitored for humanitarian purposes, and none of those funds (now frozen) had been released at the time of the attack.\\n   \\n      It’s also important to note that Iran has never been at a loss for funds to support its clients, notwithstanding internationally frozen assets, heavy international sanctions and abiding economic problems. Ironically, such spending is controversial even in Iran itself; revelations concerning the substantial billions Iran spends on foreign adventurism helped fuel anti-government protests in 2018.\\n   \\n      There has been much speculation about whether, given these well-documented ties, Iran ordered the Hamas operation in southern Israel. The White House has tentatively concluded that while Tehran has provided material assistance that could facilitate such an operation, it has\\xa0no information\\xa0to suggest that Iran did so.\\n   \\n      Despite a story in The Wall Street Journal of Hamas sources claiming\\xa0Iran helped plan the attack,\\xa0there is no analytical unanimity, and no firm public evidence, verifying this report. Other intelligence reported in the WSJ that Hamas militants recently received\\xa0some specialized training in Iran hasn’t been linked specifically to the\\xa0October 7 attacks.\\n   \\n      While\\xa0Iran shares an anti-Israel agenda with Hamas, many\\xa0experts assess\\xa0it has never had the ability to control it and doesn’t require prior authorization for its activities. It is reasonable to assume, as the US has said, that\\xa0Iran was surprised\\xa0(albeit\\xa0pleased) with the October 7 operations.\\n   \\n      All of which is consistent with the fact that neither Iran nor Hezbollah appear to have committed to more intensive involvement — yet Iran is reportedly fearful of a harsh response\\xa0if it crosses Israel’s red lines. Meanwhile, Hezbollah’s\\xa0probing attacks\\xa0in Israel’s north over the past two weeks may be intended as signs of solidarity with Hamas and to keep Israel distracted from Gaza. And while the Iran-allied Houthis in Yemen have\\xa0fired shots\\xa0at Israel in recent days, they haven’t yet posed a serious threat to the Jewish state.\\n   \\n      Still, Iran and its allies have their\\xa0red lines, too. Iran-backed forces in Iraq and the Houthis in Yemen have\\xa0both threatened\\xa0American targets if the US intervenes; Iran has warned against Israeli strikes on Iranian soil; and\\xa0Hezbollah has hinted\\xa0that any attempt by Israel to eliminate Hamas would be met with a major response.\\n   \\n      The situation could tip in a number of directions depending on the smallest actions, and even the domestic considerations, of the parties. For example, the alleged beating-induced coma in Iran of 16-year-old\\xa0Armita Geravand\\xa0for refusing to comply with Islamic dress laws earlier this month recalls the\\xa0dramatic nationwide demonstrations\\xa0against the morality police last year that authorities were hard pressed to put down. If a distraction is needed, could Iran’s clerical leaders look to a dramatic foreign crisis?\\n   \\n      Miscalculations — whether by Iran, Israel, Hezbollah or even the US — could rapidly lead to a multifront regional war with casualties easily numbering in the tens of thousands. None of the\\xa0major parties involved appears to have a compelling strategy to address the long-term dangers. The key players might benefit from a pause for reflection, before it’s too late.\\n  ',\n",

       "  'contents': ' \\nEditor’s note: Abood Okal, who spent part of his childhood in Gaza, lives in Massachusetts. The views in this commentary are his own. Read more opinion at CNN.\\n \\n      It started out as a family vacation. Abood Okal, 36, traveled to Gaza in late September with his wife Wafa Abuzayda and their 1-year-old son Yousef to visit relatives they hadn’t seen in years.\\n   \\n      Now, they and several other family members — most of whom have US citizenship — are stranded in Gaza, unable to get out and fearful that they could lose their lives at any time as Israeli airstrikes in the region intensify.\\n   \\n      Okal, a cancer researcher for a Massachusetts pharmaceutical company, is one of about 500 to 600 dual nationals and US permanent residents trapped in Gaza and hoping to be evacuated or to be allowed to exit Gaza by crossing the border into Egypt.\\n   \\n      For decades, his family’s home has been in northern Gaza, but the constant bombardment, and Israeli orders to evacuate, led them to flee. Now a couple dozen family and friends are holed up in a borrowed house in southern Gaza, hoping to make their way across the Egyptian border at the first opportunity.\\n   \\n      Each day, Okal faces the challenge of figuring out how to find food for his extended family amid dwindling provisions available at local shops in southern Gaza, while navigating streets rendered all but impassable after being struck by Israeli bombs.\\n   \\n      He says that never far from mind is the risk of fresh shelling that could strike his household at any time, as Israel continues a bombing campaign in Gaza that already has claimed thousands of lives, according to the Hamas-controlled Palestinian Health Ministry in Gaza. He also worries about a possible Israeli invasion, which he fears could make it even harder for his family to get to Egypt.\\n   \\n      The brutal Hamas attacks on October 7 precipitated an Israeli military response, with the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) ordering Gazans to relocate to the South as it bombarded suspected Hamas strongholds and prepared for a possible ground invasion.\\n   \\n      Okal says he reaches out to the State Department every day looking for news about a plan for when Palestinian Americans like him will be evacuated. Days into his prolonged Gaza stay, he says, he has received no clear guidance from US officials.\\n   \\n      Meanwhile, the White House said this week that it’s considering contingency plans to evacuate Americans from the Middle East. White House national security spokesman John Kirby said the US is “thinking through a broad range of contingencies and possibilities, and certainly evacuations are one of those things. We’re not at the point of execution right now.”\\n   \\nKirby added that “obviously a prime focus for us is the several hundred Americans that we know are there.”\\n   \\n      Okal spoke by phone with CNN Opinion editor Stephanie Griffith. Their conversation has been condensed and edited for clarity.\\n   \\nCNN: What actually took you to Gaza at this point in time?\\n \\nOkal: We left our home in Massachusetts on September 25 for what was supposed to be one month of vacation. We spent the first week of our trip in the West Bank, and then we went to Gaza for what was supposed to be another two weeks of vacation. Then we were supposed to spend another week visiting different cities in Israel and the West Bank because we wanted to explore some of the tourist areas and cities.\\n   \\n      My wife and I have a 1-year-old. We hadn’t been to Gaza for almost six years. We said, okay, let’s go visit some relatives. We said, we should introduce our son to his cousins, uncles and aunts. We were in Gaza for about a week when the [bombing] started, and we’ve been stranded here ever since.\\n   \\nCNN: So several days into what was supposed to be your family vacation, the Israeli bombing of Gaza started?\\n \\nOkal: Yes, when the war started on that Saturday, my wife and I immediately jumped on the phone with the State Department trying to figure out what our best options were to leave. We wanted to get out as soon as possible to protect our lives, but also for our son’s sake — we didn’t want him to live through the trauma. And so, my wife immediately packed our stuff and went to her parents’ house — the area where they live is a little bit safer than where my parents’ house is, where we had been staying.\\n   \\n      We were at my wife’s parents house a couple of days into the war when there was an airstrike about 100 feet from my parents’ house. It basically knocked all the doors out of their frame and shattered glass everywhere. That’s when my parents joined me and my wife at her parents’ house. We all huddled together until we had to leave northern Gaza and head south. As a family, we’ve decided we would live together or die together.\\n   \\nCNN: Tell me about your family in the region. Who are they, and where are they?\\n \\n      Half of us — or half of my siblings — are in the US and the other half are actually in Palestine. We are a family of eight. Four boys, four girls and we’re also split equally in half of those who are in Gaza versus those that are outside of Gaza. A brother and a sister in the US happen to be in New Jersey. And then my other older sister, she’s actually in Ramallah in the West Bank. That’s part of why we were visiting the West Bank at the beginning of our trip. And then I have two brothers and two sisters that live in Gaza.\\n   \\n      My parents are also dual citizens just like their kids. My parents actually live in northern Gaza. And my wife’s parents are between northern Gaza and Gaza City itself. But to be clear: We all fled northern Gaza not just because of the bombings, but because the IDF announced that all residents of Gaza City must immediately move south of Gaza Valley — otherwise, they might be killed during the bombing campaign.\\n   \\nCNN: Is everybody in your family considering leaving Gaza now and coming to the US?\\xa0\\n \\nOkal: That’s the plan. I think anyone who has an opportunity to leave will do so, because of the magnitude of damage and suffering that we’re seeing, which is just unthinkable. And so far, we’ve only lived through phase one [of Israeli assaults on Gaza.] Based on what we hear from news reports, the Israeli military’s phase two will be its ground invasion. Presumably, that will only make things worse.\\n   \\nCNN: After the explosion near your parents’ home in northern Gaza, you succeeded in calling the State Department. And what did they tell you?\\n \\nOkal: The very first few hours they said it’s a very dynamic and fluid situation and that they didn’t have any idea about what’s really happening. But they took our passport numbers, phone numbers, email addresses and made us register through the State Department’s STEP program, which kind of tracks you if you’re traveling overseas for urgent notification. So, we did all that and then we called again and again. We were told each time that there was no new information.\\n   \\n      Ever since, we call every single day, not missing even a single day. On certain days, I have called four or five different times. Sometimes we have switched between calling the US embassy in Jerusalem and the embassy in Cairo. As the days went on, the State Department in Washington, DC, even got involved. Now there are so many numbers for us to track. We call all of them all the time. All they tell us is, “The situation is dynamic. Stay as safe as you can. We’re working on an evacuation plan.”\\n   \\n      Early in the war, we were told by the State Department: If you can make it to the crossing, and you think it’s safe, go there. And you should be able to cross into Egypt. On Saturday, they told us that the Rafah crossing would be open and that we should head there if we deem it to be safe to do so. Nothing happened.\\n   \\n      It was the third time that based on what the State Department told us — we spent eight to 10 hours standing outside in the heat — nothing happened. And while we were waiting there, we all would call the State Department, we would call the embassy in Cairo. And all they would say is, “We don’t have any information.”\\n   \\n      Listen, we live in northern Gaza. We were not asking for a full-fledged, secure path from Gaza City in the North all the way to the South. We were willing to take that risk. All we want is the guarantee that once we make it to the Egyptian border, we will be able to cross. Yet, nobody in the State Department was able to confirm that for us.\\n   \\n      Luckily, where we’re staying right now is less than 10 minutes from the Egyptian border. We could be there in minutes. But like I said, we were told three times since we’ve been here in southern Gaza to go to the border by the State Department and every single time, we were not able to cross, despite spending all day there.\\n   \\nCNN: That must be immensely frustrating. You’ve said you have the impression that there’s a greater level of urgency in getting US citizens or dual nationals out of Israel, compared to what the US government is doing for Palestinian Americans.\\n \\nOkal: No doubt about it. We see firsthand the amount of logistics that are being put in place to get Americans out of Israel, even though I don’t think anyone would disagree that the amount of risk exposure for Americans in Gaza is much greater than for American citizens in Israel.\\n   \\nCNN:. To what do you attribute the different treatment?\\n \\nOkal: I don’t have an explanation for that. I can try to postulate, and it certainly would drive me down a path that I would not like to believe that an American would be treated differently from another American just based on where they are located. So, I still give the benefit of the doubt that there isn’t any type of discriminatory treatment for an American in Gaza versus an American in Israel. But the reality is we see that there is a different level of effort invested in extracting an American citizen out of Israel compared to Gaza.\\n   \\nCNN: You said you’ve been monitoring news sources regarding updates on the border crossing. What news sources are those?\\xa0\\n \\nOkal: In the past 10 days, I would say since everybody started heading south, there is a complete lack of news. The networks are down for both power and internet. We haven’t had internet where we’re staying for the last several days because the network has been blown out. So we rely on cell phone signals, basically internet via the cell phone provider because we have this US number that we use as roaming.\\n   \\n      At the place where we are staying, we have power for just about an hour or two using solar panels. We’re fortunate enough to have that where we’re staying so we can charge our devices. That’s how we get our news — from our phones.\\n   \\n      Also, one of my very best friends in the US lives a mile away from us [in Massachusetts]. We used to work together in Cambridge. He follows the news about this region. I told him, “Hey, if there’s anything about the border crossing or about a ground invasion, then please text me right away. Because it takes time for us to get the news here. It’s kind of ironic that I’m getting my news about Gaza out of Massachusetts.\\n   \\nCNN: Some of that news, as you say, deals with the potential for a ground invasion by Israel. How concerned are you about that?\\xa0\\n \\nOkal: That’s my nightmare. I think it’s going to be nasty and it’s going to be very destructive, based on what the Israeli military spokespeople are saying. We’re terrified because where my parents were before we fled south was an area that’s near the northeastern border of Gaza. So, in a matter of minutes of a ground invasion, the tanks would be rolling next to where my parents’ homes are. We’re terrified because we know that our lives will be at even a greater risk.\\n   \\n      That’s part of why we’re trying to exit Gaza as fast as possible. We’re trying to flee as fast as we can while we still can — before the invasion starts. That is when curfews will happen. You literally wouldn’t be able to move depending on where you are moving. I probably wouldn’t be able to even step outside right now to make this phone call. The invasion will be a huge nightmare if we are still in Gaza when it starts.\\n   \\nCNN: What is the house that you’re living in now? How did you find it? I mean, it sounded like mission impossible when Israel ordered more than a million Gazans to leave the North and go south.\\n \\nOkal: Basically, we were lucky, because this house belongs to a friend of my wife’s dad — basically a friend of a friend of a friend. They’re out of town and they said, yes, you’re welcome to stay at it. The keys are with the neighbors.\\n   \\n      So, we came and stayed here. Right now, we’re a total of 40 people. My family makes up 25 people: basically myself, my wife and our son, her parents, my parents, my brother, his wife and his twin daughters, my sister and her three children, my wife’s two uncles and their families.\\n   \\n      It’s kind of like my entire immediate and closest circle of family because everyone’s fleeing for their lives. And we’re huddled on the first floor. Then on the second floor, the owners of the house have their relatives that are escaping northern Gaza. So, 40 people in total, in a single-family home.\\n   \\nCNN: What do you think is going to become of Gaza?\\n \\nOkal: I don’t know, but it already is no longer the Gaza that I knew before leaving 17 years ago and moving to the US. Entire neighborhoods in the center of Gaza City have been taken out. There were major landmarks that everybody would know are gone. You’re talking about 1.1 million people who have fled south. My parents have the feeling — and my wife’s parents do as well — that they will never see their homes again, even though it’s about a 10-mile drive north of here. I won’t be going back, and I can’t imagine that anyone I know will be back. The amount of destruction there is just unthinkable.\\n   \\nCNN: And all 25 of your relatives are going to try to get the State Department to arrange their passage into Egypt?\\n \\nOkal: We wish. Not all of them are American citizens. We’ve been told by the State Department transit will be allowed for Americans and their immediate relatives, meaning spouse and children if they’re not American. That’s the heartbreaking part: that while we’re trying as hard as we can to leave, we know we will be leaving family and loved ones behind.\\n  ',\n",

       "  'contents': ' \\n  Editor’s Note: Amy Bass (@bassab1) is professor of sport studies at\\xa0Manhattanville College\\xa0and the author of “One Goal: A Coach, a Team, and the Game That Brought a Divided Town Together” and “Not the Triumph but the Struggle: The 1968 Olympics and the Making of the Black Athlete,” among other titles. The views expressed here are solely hers. Read more\\xa0opinion\\xa0on CNN.\\n \\n      I thought about Lewiston, Maine, all day on Wednesday.\\xa0The Lewiston High School boys soccer team, the Blue Devils, the center of my book “One Goal,” had a 5pm quarterfinal game against Farmington’s Mt. Blue on Lewiston’s Don Roux field.\\xa0Since I couldn’t be there, I had to rely on the play-by-play results that the school’s athletic director, Jason Fuller, provides via X (formerly Twitter).\\n \\n      Of course\\xa0I had no idea what was to\\xa0follow that night, when at least 18 people were killed and over a dozen were injured in mass shootings at a local restaurant and bowling alley. No one could have known that was to come. During the day, I was only stressed about the game, worried because just last week, I was in Maine and saw the team lose, which they —\\xa0recently ranked 14th in the nation\\xa0— don’t do very often.\\n   \\n      Lewiston, Maine’s second most-populous city, is a place that once saw its best days in the rearview mirror, a city that has fought hard to find its light. Its story is one of transition, from its former heyday as “Spindle City,” a textile center with factory jobs that brought an influx of French-speaking Canadian immigrants to its triple-decker Italianate-style apartment houses, to its increasingly global landscape, created in large part by the thousands of Somalis who migrated there at the turn of the 21st century, immigrants who carved space for themselves amongst Quebecois culture.\\n   \\n      In short?\\xa0Lewiston is a hardscrabble hockey town that made room for soccer, a place that understands the meaning and worth of community and the work that goes into making a city into home.\\n   \\n      I had been in town for a short residency at Bates College, my alma mater, the reason I first lived in Lewiston as a temporary resident. As always, I centered my trip around high school soccer, and purposely scheduled the visit around the “Battle of the Bridge” game — Lewiston versus Edward Little, which sits just across the Androscoggin River in Auburn, the other half of Maine’s twin cities, in southwest Maine, north of Portland.\\n   \\n      New England never pays much attention to weather forecasts, so despite the best predictions otherwise, it poured. But I was there with Mike McGraw, the now-retired coach of Lewiston soccer who brought the team to its first state championship title in 2015 with a roster in which all but one of the starters was an African refugee.\\xa0We climbed to the top of the bleachers, where McGraw used his own coat to wipe a spot dry for me. We enjoyed a passionate and action-packed match between the two rivals, a game made all the more fun because the players know each other so well, as soccer moves freely back and forth across the river, often transcending the mascots and colors that come with high school life.\\n   \\n      Lewiston lost.\\xa0 But it was a delightful evening, seeing former players and friends who had come out to support the team, to support Dan Gish, who had taken the reins as head coach from McGraw a few years ago, to support the game, and — most importantly — to support the community.\\xa0 The evening finished over a few pitchers of beer at the Blue Goose, a Lewiston institution in the middle of downtown where McGraw has held court since his 21st birthday in 1970.\\n   \\n      Wednesday’s game was a different story in every way.\\xa0On the pitch, a tense, scoreless game under a fading cotton candy sky went into overtime, until Mohammed Gabow got his head on captain Obed Antonio’s corner kick to give the Blue Devils the 1-0 win. That victory sent them to the semifinals,\\xa0a home game scheduled for this Saturday at 2pm\\n \\n      It felt good. But then as news bulletins began to emerge about a shooting spree in Lewiston, everything changed.\\n   \\n      “We went from a playoff overtime win to realizing what really matters in life,” Gish told me Thursday morning.\\xa0 “My wife [the principal at Geiger Elementary School in Lewiston] called me as she was going home from parent teacher conferences; she was stopped immediately by an officer and told to get out of there fast. I was thinking about going to watch the rest of the Edward Little game but instead got home to my family. Checked on my mother. Texted my captains and coaches to make sure they were okay.”\\n   \\n      Edward Little’s quarterfinal game, tied 2-2 with Topsham’s Mount Ararat High School,\\xa0was suspended before overtime began, county officials’ shelter in place and lockdown orders sending folks home.\\n   \\n      “The more time goes on, we realize the connections we have to the people who lost their lives,” Gish\\xa0told me.\\xa0 “I want to see my soccer family and give them a big hug and tell them it’s going to be okay. We have so much to play for.”\\n   \\n      So, while Republican Rep. Lauren Boebert might send her prayers to\\xa0(a misspelled)“Lewistown”\\xa0and much needed debates about guns and the NRA and regulation and legislation undoubtedly will take place, likely to no avail, right now Lewiston needs to find its light amidst unspeakable darkness.\\xa0We all know places like Lewiston, places where everyone is connected in some way, whether through soccer or something else.\\xa0As my social media feeds changed from those marking themselves “safe” to those looking for information about a loved one who didn’t come home, I turned to McGraw, as always, for the last word on the community.\\n   \\n      “I’ve read more than several posts from people that say that Lewiston is a good place to live,” he said. “The city is strong. People are looking out for each other.”\\n   \\n      Go ya’ Big Blue.\\n  ',\n",

       " {'headline': '\\n      Opinion: If only Trump’s Mandela comparison were the most outrageous thing he’s said\\n    ',\n",
       "  'contents': ' \\n      This week, at a campaign stop in New Hampshire, former President\\xa0Donald Trump\\xa0compared himself to Nelson Mandela.\\n   \\n      Yes, the man who was born into a wealthy family and whose companies still managed to declare\\xa0multiple bankruptcies,\\xa0who has been accused of acts of\\xa0sexual harassment\\xa0and abuse, who stoked\\xa0racial and ethnic division, who tried to dismantle American administrative and\\xa0democratic systems\\xa0and norms every chance he got, and who currently faces charges on\\xa091 crimes\\xa0across several jurisdictions, compared himself to\\xa0a man who risked his life\\xa0to end apartheid and establish democratic rule in South Africa, eventually becoming the country’s first Black president and a global icon for all of those who believe in equality and democracy.\\xa0(Trump has denied wrongdoing in the accusations against him.)\\n   \\n      It doesn’t take a whole lot of historical knowledge to know that Trump is no Nelson Mandela. And anyone who has the gall and the gargantuan ego to compare themselves to Nelson Mandela is probably no Nelson Mandela.\\n   \\n      For any other president,\\xa0hyper-narcissistic comments\\xa0like this would be a major liability. For Trump, they’re the norm — and his followers, disturbingly,\\xa0seem to eat it up.\\n   \\n      Trump made the Mandela comparison because he is facing so many criminal charges, which he says are politically motivated. “I don’t mind being Nelson Mandela, because I’m doing it for a reason,” he told his\\xa0New Hampshire audience. Mandela, of course, was jailed for his pro-democracy activism; he fought one of the most brutally racist regimes in the world and was a political prisoner for 27 years. He won the presidency in South Africa’s first ever free, fair, democratic election.\\n   \\n      Trump, by contrast,\\xa0faces charges\\xa0related to attempting to overturn a free and fair democratic election. Some of his former allies are set to testify against him, and some have\\xa0pleaded guilty\\xa0to save themselves\\xa0from\\xa0even harsher potential outcomes. This week, Trump’s former attorney and “fixer”\\xa0Michael Cohen\\xa0is set to testify in Trump’s civil fraud trial.\\xa0Three of his former lawyers have pleaded guilty to crimes related to efforts to overturn the 2020 election.\\n   \\n      That isn’t exactly the biography of a pro-democracy national hero fighting a violent system of enforced racial segregation.\\n   \\n      Nor has Trump behaved in any way that could be described as “statesmanlike” since leaving office. He has continued to perpetuate the big lie that the 2020 election was stolen, a flatly false claim that stokes his ego and inflamed his base, but badly undermines\\xa0public confidence\\xa0in American democratic functioning.\\n   \\n      Contrasting Trump with former President\\xa0Barack Obama\\xa0is instructive: while Obama has used his platform to cheer for America and make measured, thoughtful statements in times of\\xa0global crisis, Trump has used his to insult Americans he believes have wronged\\xa0him and to issue absolutely unhinged missives.\\n   \\n      In the aftermath of Hamas’ horrific terrorist attack on Israeli civilians and Israel’s subsequent devastating war in Gaza, Obama\\xa0issued a statement condemning Hamas, empathizing with Israelis, reasserting Israel’s right to defend itself and urging Israel to protect as many innocent Palestinian lives as possible.\\n   \\n      Initially, the former president lashed out at Benjamin Netanyahu, saying the Israeli prime minister was caught unprepared by Hamas’ attack and called Hezbollah terrorists “very smart.” But after facing wide criticism, even among his party, Trump has said he stands with Israel and has vowed to bring back his infamous travel ban and extend it to include people from the Palestinian territory of Gaza.\\n   \\n      The former president is, at this point, notorious for making comments that run the gamut from offensive to delusional to obviously false to disturbingly grandiose to profoundly dehumanizing.\\n   \\n      In 2020, enough Americans were sick of him to boot him from the White House. His base of loyal, almost cult-like supporters, though, continue to rally behind him, seemingly determined to prove\\xa0Trump’s claim\\xa0that he “could stand in the middle of 5th\\xa0Avenue and shoot somebody and [he] wouldn’t lose voters.”\\n   \\n      Comparing himself to Mandela is unhinged, egomaniacal and outrageous, but it’s also far from the most absurd thing this president has ever said. And it very well might not lose him even one voter.\\xa0\\xa0But it does, again, show just how troublingly tolerant a vast swath of the US electorate is of a man who has repeatedly demonstrated he cares about himself (and his own wealth and his own power) more than anything else — and at the expense of the nation.\\n   \\n      It is not good for a country to have a malignant narcissist in charge. It is not good to have a president who chooses\\xa0self-aggrandizement and self-pity over statesmanship. It’s a shame that so much of America didn’t learn that lesson the first time around.\\n  ',\n",

       " {'headline': '\\n      Opinion: Britney Spears’ howl of rage is one we all need to hear\\n    ',\n",
       "  'contents': ' \\n  Editor’s Note: Holly Thomas is a writer and editor based in London. She is morning editor at Katie Couric Media. She tweets\\xa0@HolstaT. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. View\\xa0more opinion\\xa0on CNN.\\n \\n      Britney Spears’ recently released memoir, “The Woman In Me,” opens with a succinct but devastating bit of family history. Her paternal grandfather dispatched her grandmother Jean to an asylum. Jean was consumed with grief following the death of their three-day-old baby. She was put on lithium in the facility and subsequently shot herself over the grave of her dead child. “Tragedy runs in my family,” Spears observes. Given what follows, it’s hard to argue.\\n   \\n      Spears’ own story is a howl of rage that appears more justified with every chapter. Born in 1981, she describes her childhood in Kentwood, Louisiana trying to avoid her “mean, apathetic, and cold” father Jamie, and waiting tables from 8 years old between efforts to break into show business. In 1997, at 15, she was signed by Jive Records and swiftly commodified as a pop superstar espousing hollow family values. In 2007, a bereavement, a vicious custody battle and the paparazzi’s relentless hounding saw her start to unravel. Like a monster who’d been lurking in the shadows, Jamie reappeared. We all know what came next.\\n   \\n      The ridicule that met Spears’ 2007 “meltdown” has since been reevaluated. We’d like to think that nowadays, the public and the media would have a more nuanced, sympathetic response (though for the record, “If Britney survived 2007…” merch is still on sale). By Spears’ own admission, her behavior was concerning, but she remains adamant that it didn’t remotely merit what followed. Either way, we have a language for mental health crises that didn’t exist then, plus (slightly) more empathy for famous young women. Unfortunately, that’s only half the battle.\\n   \\n      In Spears’ chilling account, she says her father exploited that period of unrest to secure his position as conservator of her person and estate for 13 years. Empowered by California law to govern the most prosaic, minute aspects of her life and work, he subjected her to a regime so punishing that she writes: “I started to wonder if they did want to kill me.” Her mother, meanwhile, rode the crest of her public humiliation — and stratospheric fame — to promote her own book. The specifics of Spears’ situation were bizarre. But her central problem of being gaslit into submission was embedded in hyper-normalized and potentially dangerous ideals.\\n   \\n      Once Spears realized her conservatorship was inevitable, she begged the court not to appoint her father to oversee it. “Anyone off the street would have been better,” she writes. Her pleas were ignored. She recounts how Jamie — who she describes as an abusive, previously bankrupt alcoholic who’d been absent from her life for years — was deemed more capable of running her life than she was. Positioned as a doting father, Jamie’s depiction of his daughter as incompetent was accepted despite his lack of qualifications, and the fact that his colossal salary and those of his attorneys were allegedly funded by Spears’ own exceptionally demanding work.\\n   \\n      The fact that Jamie was able to reenter and quickly dominate Spears’ life with apparently minimal difficulty shouldn’t surprise us. Though familial estrangement appears to be on the rise, cutting off family members still carries immense shame — and was far more taboo just a decade or two ago. As the media storm around Meghan Markle’s father has recently demonstrated, public efforts to “reconnect” tend to garner support, or at the very least, attention. And Spears wasn’t set up to object.\\n   \\n      Having been marketed as a virginal American sweetheart from her mid-teens, Spears was compelled to offer proof of her wholesome family ethos throughout her early career. In a now-notorious 2003 interview, Diane Sawyer asked the then-21-year-old to justify her breakup with Justin Timberlake (who, Spears claims in her book, cheated on her and dumped her by text). Unaware of the details, Sawyer told Spears she’d “upset a lot of mothers in this country.”\\n   \\n      Another journalist in 2004 preempted a question about how supportive her mother was with the leading remark: “I just love seeing you with your mom so much and holding hands in magazines…” Once she became a mother herself, Spears’ aptitude was under constant scrutiny. In a 2007 interview that was meant to focus on her album “Blackout,” she recalls Ryan Seacrest asking: “How do you respond to those who criticize you as a mom?” Again and again, she was coerced to portray her family as irreproachable bastions of support, and taught that any resistance would be interpreted as incriminating.\\n   \\n      The exhausting responsibility of being accountable to such absurd standards since childhood, followed by the constant refrain that she was a hapless, immature wreck under the conservatorship, resulted in a self-fulfilling, “Benjamin Button”-like effect. “I became a robot… a sort of, child robot,” Spears writes in “The Woman In Me.” “I had been so infantilized that I was losing pieces of what made me feel like myself.” In 2019, in a cruel echo of her grandmother’s fate, she says she was put on lithium during an involuntary stint in rehab. The catalyst? She’d objected to a dance move in her Las Vegas show.\\n   \\n      Spears’ determination to escape this torturous cycle — and her conservatorship’s termination in 2021 — should be irrefutable proof of her fortitude. And yet, her Instagram page, which Spears sees as a lighthearted forum to explore self-expression, has repeatedly been the subject of concern trolling. Observers called the police to her home after she briefly deleted her account in January, and again in September after she posted a video of herself dancing with knives (she later said they were fake). Both times, the authorities left without incident.\\xa0As Spears explains in her book, dancing and messing around — in outfits even she acknowledges are “bad” — are her rebukes to years spent being trussed up by other people. After what she’s been through, the freedom to express herself feels like the least she deserves.\\n   \\n      In her remarkably prescient 2001 single, “I’m Not A Girl, Not Yet a Woman,” the lyrics of which appear to have inspired the title of her memoir, Spears sang: “All I need is time, a moment that is mine, while I’m in between.” At 41, with a decades-long career already in the rearview, she can hardly be characterized as a girl in the literal sense. Nevertheless, her desire to play following years of chaos and exorbitant premature responsibility is relatable to anyone who knows the pain of a stolen childhood. The assumption that our relations have our best interests at heart doesn’t always bear out. But as Spears’ story shows, it can be remarkably hard to disprove.\\n  ',\n",

So far, four have pleaded guilty. \\n   \\n      In a tearful apology in court, Ellis spoke of her personal “failures” and expressed “deep remorse” while disavowing her involvement in Trump’s legal efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election. \\n   \\n      “As an attorney who is also a Christian, I take my responsibilities as a lawyer very seriously and I endeavor to be a person of sound moral and ethical character in all of my dealings,” Ellis said. But after the 2020 election, “I failed to do my due diligence,” she said. \\n   \\n      “I relied on others, including lawyers with many more years of experience than I, to provide me with true and reliable information … what I did not do, but should have done, your honor, was to make sure that the facts the other lawyers alleged to be true were, in fact, true,” Ellis said. \\n   \\n      The plea from Ellis implicated Giuliani in a state crime – lying to Georgia legislators by peddling false voter-fraud theories.

       " {'headline': '\\n      The 10 Senate seats most likely to flip in 2024\\n    ',\n",
       "  'contents': ' \\n      While events on the other side of the world – and the other end of the US Capitol – have dominated recent news, the race for control of the Senate is a crucial factor in what Washington could look like after next year’s elections. \\n   \\n      The 2024 Senate map is advantageous for Republicans as they try to pick up the one or two seats needed to flip the chamber, depending on who wins the White House next year. Members of the Senate Democratic Caucus are defending the most competitive seats – the top eight on this list of 10 seats most likely to flip – which is not likely to change ahead of November 2024.  \\n   \\n      The order of the ranking, however, is changing. (Rankings are based on CNN’s reporting, fundraising figures and historical data about how states and candidates have performed.) Pennsylvania, for example, shoots up from No. 7 in July to No. 4 this month – in large part because it’s the one battleground where Republicans aren’t facing a messy primary. \\n   \\n      GOP candidate fields elsewhere have only grown over the past couple of months, despite the National Republican Senatorial Committee’s new policy of taking sides in primaries. Besides Pennsylvania, the national party has made its preference known for specific candidates in West Virginia, Montana, Nevada and Michigan. The NRSC is neutral in Ohio’s crowded primary and hasn’t ruled out endorsing in Arizona.  \\n   \\n      Whether engaging in primaries early on will pay off remains to be seen. So far, however, NRSC Chairman Steve Daines’ tactic of keeping Donald Trump close appears to be working, as the former president hasn’t yet endorsed against any of the campaign committee’s picks. \\n   \\n      The GOP presidential front-runner – with his four criminal indictments – is likely to be a liability in some places next year if he is the party’s nominee. But Republicans take comfort in the fact that he won the top three states on this list handily in 2020 and red-state Democrats will have to run with an unpopular President Joe Biden atop the ticket. In an era of increasingly nationalized politics, it’s becoming harder to run for Senate in a state that voted for the opposite party’s presidential nominee. In Democrats’ favor, however, Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, Jon Tester of Montana and Sherrod Brown of Ohio have succeeded at it before.  \\n   \\n      Vulnerable Democratic senators will try to distance themselves from Biden where they can or try to signal that they represent a check on the White House. For example, six of them (plus independent Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, who caucuses with Democrats) recently joined a bipartisan call to the secretary of state to freeze $6 billion in Iranian assets after Hamas’ attack on Israel – even though the administration has made clear that the money hasn’t been touched, has strict restrictions around it and the US hasn’t found a direct link between Iran and the Hamas attack. \\n   \\n      It’s too early to say whether current events – especially abroad – could have any impact on elections that are still over a year away, but with the GOP-led House paralyzed without a speaker and Congress being called upon to approve aid to Israel and Ukraine, the moment has underscored how congressional contests have very real consequences. \\n   \\n      Here’s where things stand in the race for the Senate just over a year before Election Day 2024: \\n   \\nIncumbent: Democrat Joe Manchin\\n \\n      West Virginia remains the seat most likely to change party hands next year, whatever Sen. Joe Manchin does. The most conservative Democrat in the Senate – who hasn’t ruled out running as an independent for reelection or for president – Manchin isn’t expected to announce his plans until the end of this year. He raised $715,000 in the July-to-September third quarter – enough to maintain appearances that he’ll be a candidate next year. The haul is also more than what either of his major GOP opponents raised but about half a million less than his previous quarter total. (The chances of this seat flipping only go up if Manchin declines to seek a third full term.)  \\n   \\n      Even if he runs without the “D” after his name, he’ll have an uphill battle in a state Trump won by 39 points in 2020. His vulnerability is apparent in the way GOP-affiliated ads are tying him to Biden and Democratic-aligned spots are tying him to Trump. One Nation, for example, has attacked him over his support of Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act, while Duty and Honor PAC has touted Manchin’s work with Trump to protect miners’ pensions.  \\n   \\n      The immediate fight, however, is the GOP primary, where Jim Justice, the popular Democrat-turned-Republican governor, has outraised Rep. Alex Mooney by about $300,000. While national Republicans and Trump are behind Justice, the Club for Growth and an allied super PAC have committed nearly $13.6 million to the House Freedom Caucus member. The club’s political arm is airing ads calling Justice a RINO, or Republican in Name Only, and trying to tie him to Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell.  \\n   \\nIncumbent: Democrat Jon Tester\\n \\n      Sen. Jon Tester, another red-state Democrat, is no stranger to tough races. But the most pressing question is whether GOP Rep. Matt Rosendale – fresh off his vote to oust House Speaker Kevin McCarthy – decides to complicate national Republicans’ plans by mounting his own bid to avenge his 2018 loss to Tester. The NRSC likes retired Navy SEAL Tim Sheehy, who already has the backing of the two other members of Montana’s congressional delegation (including Daines, the NRSC chairman) and Gov. Greg Gianforte. Sheehy, who entered the race in July, raised $2.9 million in the most recent fundraising quarter (including about $653,000 in personal money), but he’s a relative newcomer. (The Minnesota native has taken heat, for example, for saying in a Breitbart News interview that there were more bears than people in Montana.)  \\n   \\n      Rosendale, too, has out-of-state roots, and his House campaign only brought in about $335,000 during the third quarter. But as a previous statewide candidate – he was elected state auditor in 2016 and lost to Tester by about 4 points in 2018 – he starts with more built-in name recognition than Sheehy and could potentially benefit from assistance from the Club for Growth. Sheehy has been on air trying to introduce himself, leaning heavily into his military service and using ranching motifs to highlight his ties to the state. He’s also been attacking Tester for not adhering to some of the commitments in an ethics pledge he ran on during his first campaign, as CNN’s KFile reported.  \\n   \\n      An outside group called Last Best Place PAC, seemingly linked to Democrats, is attacking Sheehy – a sign Democrats may think he’d be a tougher opponent than Rosendale. Tester appears to be taking the race seriously – he raised more than $5 million in the third quarter and ended September with $13 million. \\n   \\nIncumbent: Democrat Sherrod Brown\\n \\n      Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown is gearing up for a tough race in a state that’s been trending red over the past decade. (He raised $5.8 million in the third quarter, ending the period with $11.2 million.) He’ll need all the money he can get if he faces one of the two self-funders vying for the GOP nomination. Both businessman Bernie Moreno and state Sen. Matt Dolan loaned their campaigns $3 million in the third quarter. Secretary of State Frank LaRose – who raised about $1 million, including $250,000 he loaned his campaign – doesn’t have the same kinds of personal resources, but he likely starts with a name ID advantage as the only statewide elected official in the GOP race. He became the public face of an August ballot effort to raise the threshold for amending the state constitution – seen as a proxy fight over an upcoming November referendum on abortion rights. LaRose admitted the measure was effectively about abortion, so the effort’s failure has been a point of attack from his primary opponents.  \\n   \\n      Trump carried Ohio twice, and his backing proved instrumental in getting now-Sen. JD Vance over the finish line in last year’s Republican primary, which also featured Dolan and, briefly, Moreno. Vance is backing Moreno in this primary, and while Trump has praised Moreno, he hasn’t made any endorsement yet. The NRSC is so far staying neutral in this race. The candidates met for their first forum last weekend, where US aid to Ukraine was a point of divergence between Moreno – who, like Vance, wants to suspend it – and Dolan, who wants it to continue. (LaRose called for making aid contingent on securing the US southern border.)  \\n   \\n      Meanwhile, Brown has been on the picket line with striking United Auto Workers – underscoring the economic populist streak that Democrats hope will allow him to defy the political tilt of his state once again.  \\n   \\nIncumbent: Democrat Bob Casey\\n \\n      The Keystone State moves up several spots this month largely because of how uniquely settled the GOP primary is compared with other battleground states. Republicans coalesced around Dave McCormick to take on Democratic Sen. Bob Casey soon after the former hedge fund executive got into the race in late September. (State Sen. Doug Mastriano announced in May that he was passing on a bid – a major relief for national Republicans who were wary of the failed 2022 gubernatorial candidate and election denier.)  \\n   \\n      But Democrats think McCormick, who unsuccessfully sought the state’s other Senate seat last year, has his own baggage. He tried to tack to the right in an effort to secure Trump’s endorsement and the GOP nomination in the 2022 Senate primary, which could alienate some suburban Philadelphia voters in a general election. He’s also facing questions about his residency. McCormick insists that he lives in Pennsylvania but returns to Connecticut to visit his daughter, who’s still in school there and lives with his ex-wife. “And if there’s a political cost associated with that, so be it,” he recently told ABC27’s “This Week in Pennsylvania.”\\n \\n      Still, the combination of McCormick and his vast personal resources during a presidential year are likely to make this Casey’s most competitive Senate race yet. The three-term incumbent, who raised $3.2 million in the third quarter, has a well-known political name in the state and enjoys a 48% job approval (and 31% disapproval) rating, according to a Quinnipiac University poll released earlier this month. He led McCormick 50% to 44% among registered voters in that survey, but this race is still young.  \\n   \\nIncumbent: Independent Kyrsten Sinema\\n \\n      Kari Lake – who embraced election denialism and conspiracy theories in her losing 2022 gubernatorial bid – was far from Republicans’ dream Senate candidate in this emerging purple state. But the former TV anchor is going to be hard to beat in a primary given her strong connection with the GOP base. Trump endorsed her by video at her announcement rally earlier this month, and there are signs that the party establishment is trying to keep her close. “We have not ruled out endorsing Lake,” a source familiar with the NRSC’s strategy told CNN. Daines has said the national party has had “productive conversations” with Lake, who recently told The Associated Press she’d vote for McConnell for leader. She’s also picked up the backing of Senate GOP Conference Chairman John Barrasso.  \\n   \\n      But Lake still won’t admit she lost last year’s gubernatorial race and her past hard-line positions on abortion could turn off swing voters. Her candidacy represents a familiar challenge for Arizona Republicans, whose recent nominees for key offices swung right in the primary and then struggled to pivot to the general election. Pinal County Sheriff Mark Lamb is also running for Senate, but raised just $475,000 in the third quarter.  \\n   \\n      The race will remain unsettled, however, until Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, who left the Democratic Party to become an independent last year, announces whether she’s running. Her $825,000 haul in the third quarter raised questions about her future, given that it was less than what she’s raised in the past. But Sinema still had more than $10 million in the bank as of September 30. Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego, meanwhile, outraised her yet again – bringing in $3.1 million last quarter – but had about half of her cash on hand.  \\n   \\nIncumbent: Democrat Jacky Rosen\\n \\n      Nevada is a slightly more Democratic state than most on this list, although that’s not saying much. It voted for Biden by about 2 points, so Democrats aren’t taking Sen. Jacky Rosen’s reelection for granted. She raised $2.7 million in the third quarter, ending with $8.8 million in the bank.  \\n   \\n      National Republicans have made clear their preference for retired Army Capt. Sam Brown, an unsuccessful 2022 Senate candidate who’s trying to tie Rosen to Biden and his economic policies. But that hasn’t winnowed the GOP field. Trump’s former ambassador to Iceland, Jeff Gunter, entered the race in August and has cut an ad that refers to him as “110% pro-Trump.” Retired Air Force Lt. Col. Tony Grady, who lost a GOP primary bid for lieutenant governor last year, also jumped into the race in August. Former state Assemblyman Jim Marchant, an election denier and the losing 2022 GOP nominee for Nevada secretary of state, only raised $74,000 last quarter, compared with $1.2 million for Brown. \\n   \\n      The primary isn’t until June, but Democrats are already seizing on what they see as vulnerabilities in Brown’s abortion positioning, including comments he made during a 2014 run for the Texas state legislature and his past work with the Nevada Faith and Freedom Coalition.  \\n   \\nIncumbent: Democrat Tammy Baldwin\\n \\n      Wisconsin slides down one spot on this list, in part because Republicans still don’t have a major candidate to take on Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin. That doesn’t mean this race won’t eventually be very competitive in a battleground presidential state that swung from Trump to Biden in 2020.  \\n   \\n      Republicans are eyeing businessman and 2012 Senate candidate Eric Hovde, who would likely have the ability to self-fund. Baldwin raised $3.1 million during the third quarter and began October with about $6.9 million in the bank. This is one of the few states where presidential performance isn’t necessarily indicative of Senate race outcomes. GOP Sen. Ron Johnson, for example, won a third term last year after Biden had carried the state, albeit by only about half a point, two years earlier.  \\n   \\nIncumbent: Democrat Debbie Stabenow (retiring)\\n \\n      Michigan is a bluer state than its Midwestern neighbor Wisconsin – Biden carried the Wolverine State by nearly 3 points and Democrats saw success up and down the ticket in 2022, in part because abortion was such a galvanizing issue. Democrats are now trying to ensure that retiring Sen. Debbie Stabenow’s seat remains in their hands. Much of the party has coalesced around Rep. Elissa Slotkin, who raised nearly $3 million in the third quarter, although she does face primary challenges, including from actor Hill Harper, who raised about $559,000 and kicked in about $463,000 more of his own money.  \\n   \\n      Republicans landed a prominent recruit in former Rep. Mike Rogers, who succeeded Stabenow in the House and represented an earlier version of Slotkin’s Lansing-area seat for seven terms. Rogers, who raised $824,00 in the third quarter after entering the race in September, earned immediate praise from the NRSC as the “type of candidate who can perform well with suburban Michiganders.” And although the former House Intelligence chairman may use his recent absence from elected politics as a selling point, the GOP has changed a lot since he left Congress in 2015 – especially in Michigan, where the state party has a controversial new chair.  \\n   \\n      Since entering the race, Rogers has already landed a primary challenge from former Detroit Police Chief James Craig, who was disqualified from last year’s governor’s race over signature issues. Former Rep. Peter Meijer, who has formed an exploratory committee, could still run – although the one-term congressman isn’t likely to curry much favor with the GOP base after voting to impeach Trump in 2021.  \\n   \\nIncumbent: Republican Ted Cruz\\n \\n      Texas is a hard state for Democrats to flip – they haven’t won a statewide election here since 1994, their longest losing streak in the country. But GOP Sen. Ted Cruz makes a good villain for national Democrat donors. (See Beto O’Rourke’s massive 2018 fundraising hauls in his closer-than-expected loss to the senator.)  \\n   \\n      The question, however, is whether that grassroots Democratic opposition to Cruz can translate widely enough to deny him a third term. Democratic Rep. Colin Allred, who has already proved to be a strong fundraiser, brought in $4.7 million in the third quarter – more than Cruz’s $3.1 million. Democrats tout the former NFL player’s background as a good fit for Texas – he first won election to the House by flipping a GOP-held district in the Dallas area and has previously won support from the US Chamber of Commerce.  \\n   \\n      But although Allred already appears focused on Cruz, he’ll have to get through a crowded primary first. Among the other candidates is state Sen. Roland Guttierez, who represents Uvalde and raised $632,000 in the third quarter.  \\n   \\nIncumbent: Republican Rick Scott\\n \\n      Former Democratic Rep. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell announced her campaign to take on GOP Sen. Rick Scott in late August. Despite only being in the race for part of the third quarter, she narrowly outraised the first-term senator and former governor – $1.5 million to $1.4 million. Scott gave his campaign an additional $154,000 of his own money, and there’s plenty more where that came from for the wealthy former health care CEO.  \\n   \\n      Florida has been trending red in recent years – Trump carried the state by about 3 points in 2020, nearly tripling his margin from four years earlier. But each of Scott’s races for governor and Senate have been relatively close, and he’s never run in a presidential year. Democrats have targeted him over some of his more unpopular policy proposals – such as a sunset provision for all federal programs, which he later revised to exclude Social Security and Medicare after criticism from within his own party. The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, for example, has been running digital ads casting Scott and Cruz as threats to popular entitlement programs.  \\n   \\n      Even with Democratic investment, though, it’s going to take a lot to flip this seat blue. The state’s senior senator, Republican Marco Rubio, won reelection last year over a high-profile Democratic opponent by 16 points.  \\n  ',\n",

We’re looking back at the strongest, smartest\\xa0opinion takes\\xa0of the week from CNN and other outlets.\\n \\n      It was the speech President Franklin D. Roosevelt never gave. In a radio address scheduled for April 13, 1945, the fourth-term president would have said, “If civilization is to survive, we must cultivate the science of human relationships — the ability of all peoples, of all kinds, to live together and work together, in the same world, at peace.”\\n   \\n      But the day before, Roosevelt was sitting for a portrait at his cottage in Warm Springs, Georgia, when he suddenly slumped in his chair, the victim of a stroke. He didn’t live to see the allies’ victory in World War II that year or the conference in San Francisco that month that established the United Nations.\\n   \\n      Roosevelt originally conceived of the UN as a muscular force to keep the peace, with the United States, Soviet Union, United Kingdom and China acting as “four policemen” to rein in nations that would otherwise go to war. He wanted, in the words of the undelivered April 13 speech, “an end, forever, to this impractical, unrealistic settlement of the differences between governments by the mass killing of peoples.”\\n   \\n      The world in 2023 is a much different place, but peace, as Roosevelt envisioned it, remains elusive. A two-week-old conflict in the Middle East has already claimed thousands of lives against the backdrop of a multipolar web of alliances and rivalries in which the world’s major powers often lack the ability to restrain conflict, and sometimes even encourage it.\\n   \\n      On Thursday evening, though, President Joe Biden, who was a toddler when FDR died, sounded a Rooseveltian tone in asserting that the US still bears a special responsibility for seeking to promote world peace. He proposed billions in new aid to both Ukraine and Israel.\\n   \\n      “We’re facing an inflection point in history — one of the moments where the decisions we make today are going to determine the future for decades to come,” Biden argued. “American leadership is what holds the world together. American alliances are what keep us, America, safe.”\\n   \\n      Biden spoke just after returning from a trip to Israel to demonstrate support for an ally mourning the loss of more than 1,400 people in the October 7 Hamas terrorist attack. But his diplomatic efforts to meet with Arab leaders came undone after a devastating explosion at a hospital in Gaza. While Israel released evidence that the blast resulted from a rocket misfired by militants in Gaza and US officials signaled agreement, that did not tame the fury of the Palestinians and their supporters in the region.\\n   \\n      What’s next?\\n   \\nSeth Moulton, a Marine Corps veteran and a Democratic congressman from Massachusetts, says there are urgent lessons from America’s 2003 war in Iraq.\\n   \\n      “Israel is about to start an invasion of Gaza with the same mission we had in those early days in Iraq: defeat the enemy, or in Netanyahu’s words,\\xa0‘crush and eliminate’ Hamas.”\\n   \\n      “But the lesson America quickly learned in Iraq and Afghanistan was that you have to have a plan for the day after. Outside the southern Iraqi city of Najaf during the invasion, then Colonel David Petraeus famously asked,\\xa0‘Tell me how this ends….’”\\n   \\n      “The next year, I found myself in that same city Petraeus had conquered, trying to win it back. It was my second of what would become four tours in Iraq, facing far worse combat than we saw during the invasion.”\\n   \\n      The origins of the two wars are very different, Moulton pointed out, but there is the commonality that in a war with insurgents, some tactics can backfire.\\n   \\n      “Nobody wants to see five-year-old Palestinian kids killed in the crossfire with Hamas, especially if their deaths only recruit more terrorists.”\\n   \\n      “And nobody wants to see five-year-old Israeli kids dying, in the same forever war, 20 years from today.”\\n   \\n      Israeli analyst Shmuel Rosner observed that “Israel says its goal is toppling Hamas, and Biden is no doubt asking: What comes later? Biden himself initially\\xa0supported the US 2003 war in Iraq\\xa0only to end up as the president who ordered the US pullout of Afghanistan. In the 20 years in between, he witnessed the two countries that the US invaded struggle to transform their leadership from one government to another. He is familiar with the cost involved, the chaos, the bloodshed… he surely wants to see a convincing answer to the question of the day after.”\\n   \\n      Biden’s trip to Israel and Oval Office speech “show\\xa0a confident, experienced commander-in-chief projecting gravitas and a deep knowledge of history,” according to David Mark. “Biden’s efforts stand out even more than usual since his likely 2024 Republican opponent, former President Donald Trump, has been clumsy and ineffective in trying to insert himself into these news events, as when he\\xa0praised Hezbollah, the Iran-backed terror group\\xa0based in Lebanon, in the wake of Hamas’ attack on Israel. At the same time, the Republicans in office are in disarray as an increasingly embarrassing Republican leadership struggle in the House has paralyzed Capitol Hill.”\\n   \\nHani Almadhoun, who grew up in the Gaza Strip, now lives in the US and works as director of philanthropy at the\\xa0United Nations Relief and Works Agency USA.\\xa0“In the northern reaches of Gaza,” he wrote, “over 20 members of my extended family seek shelter under the refuge of a staircase\\xa0—\\xa0a frail shield against the relentless and merciless storm of airstrikes.”\\n   \\n      “They tread cautiously, avoiding windows and the desolate streets where the overwhelming stench of death, fire and chaos hangs heavy in the air…”\\n   \\n      “The negative impact of this war on my family in Gaza is hard to overstate: hospitals running out of space for the dead and injured, pushing the local hospitals to\\xa0use ice cream trucks to preserve the bodies.”\\n   \\nYasmine Mohammed, whose father was born and raised in Gaza, observed that “since Hamas’ attack on Israel, as I have read post after post on social media referring to Hamas as\\xa0freedom fighters\\xa0involved in anti-colonial resistance, I have been struck by the devastating weight of this lie. It is an insult to Palestinians to refer to these terrorists as our freedom fighters.”\\n   \\n      “At the hands of Hamas, the\\xa0Jewish people\\xa0have endured horrors\\xa0not seen since the Holocaust. And, like the Nazis, Hamas does not view Jewish people as human beings. According to\\xa0its 1988 covenant, every Jew must be eradicated from this earth.\\xa0Its goal is not the genocide of Jewish people in Israel; its goal is the genocide of all Jewish people on this planet, period…”\\n   \\n      “Hamas is not Gaza, and Gaza is not Hamas. Gaza is an area of land with people who are trying to do the best that they can to survive under abysmal circumstances. Gazans are just human beings, like their Israeli neighbors. They want to live in a peaceful environment where they do not have to be concerned about the safety of their children.”\\n   \\n      When comedian Pete Davidson was 7, his father, a New York City firefighter, died responding to the 9/11 terrorist attack on the World Trade Center. As Dean Obeidallah noted, that gave Davidson’s cold open on last week’s “Saturday Night Live” a haunting resonance.\\n   \\n“In a time when social media is filled with people saying they stand with one side or the other, Davidson instead made a plea to stand for humanity,” Obeidallah observed.\\n   \\n      Davidson said, “I saw so many terrible pictures this week of children suffering — Israeli children and Palestinian children — and it took me back to a really horrible, horrible place.” He added, “No one in this world deserves to suffer like that, especially not kids.”\\n   \\n      Wadea Al-Fayoume,\\xa0a 6-year-old Palestinian-American boy was stabbed to death last weekend outside Chicago by his family’s landlord, ”a 71-year-old man who’s been charged with murder and hate crimes, among other crimes,” wrote Khaled A. Beydoun. “The attacker also stabbed Wadea’s mother more than a dozen times. She\\xa0lived. But what does that word even mean anymore?… What does ‘living’ mean for\\xa0millions of Arabs and Muslims who call the United States home, burdened with the impossible task of proving their allegiance, over and over again, in response to bellowing demands that bury our humanity?”\\n   \\n      “It feels like we are living on borrowed time, like we were extended a contingent citizenship that can be stripped at any time, on account of events that unfold in America or on the other side of the world.”\\n   \\n      For more:\\n   \\nMukesh Kapila: War didn’t look like this when the Geneva Conventions were written\\n \\nFrida Ghitis: Zelensky’s inescapable new reality\\n \\nNicole Hemmer: Why student protests against Israel are so painful, polarizing and complicated\\n \\nKobi Michael, a longtime intelligence and security analyst for Israel, told Peter Bergen that Hamas used “more than 2,000 terrorists from the special unit of Hamas, the\\xa0Nukhba,” —or more than half the unit’s total manpower — to carry out its attack on southern Israel.\\n   \\n      “What was the strategic aim of such an operation, considering that they knew for sure that the price tag would be very high and they were endangering their very existence? I’m sure that Hamas was sure that the shock and horror of this operation and the casualties that they would cause would be interpreted by all the Palestinians, that this was a sign from God that this was the time to open all the battlefronts and to fight Israel and this will be the end of the state of Israel. They were sure about it.”\\n   \\n      Bergen wrote that “Khaled Hroub,\\xa0a\\xa0Palestinian academic and the author of ‘Hamas: A Beginner’s Guide,’\\xa0says he believes that Hamas did not expect that the October 7 attack on Israel would be the scale that it became, and the\\xa0group didn’t have a plan\\xa0for what came afterward.”\\n   \\n      Neither Israel nor Hamas have “a very clear plan for what happens down the road,” Hroub said. “Even if the Israeli military succeeded in destroying Hamas, the question facing everyone is, what’s next?”\\n   \\n      The election of Jim Jordan as House speaker seemed “to make perfect sense in the era of Trump,” wrote Julian Zelizer.\\n   \\n      “Jordan is as MAGA as they come. Indeed, he was doing MAGA along with the\\xa0Tea Party long before Trump\\xa0came to town. He has been a\\xa0staunch opponent of reproductive rights, a fervent\\xa0believer in radical deregulation, a\\xa0climate change denier, a culture wars soldier and anything-goes politician who believes government shutdowns are just part of the normal price of business.”\\n   \\n      Yet through three embarrassing ballots on the House floor, and after his allies in the party and the conservative media tried to squeeze the anti-Jordan members to flip in his favor, Jordan failed to gain the 217 Republican votes needed to win the post. On Friday afternoon, he lost another vote — a secret ballot among his GOP colleagues to remain the party’s nominee for speaker — and was essentially forced to drop out.\\n   \\n“The question is what has gone wrong? Intimidation, bullying and political pressure certainly can work,” Zelizer noted. “Just look at the Republican who is by far and away the\\xa0leading contender\\xa0in the race to become the nominee for his party in 2024, former President Donald Trump.”\\n   \\n      “It is not a mystery that Trump has built an entire career on the power of intimidation. If you are against him, he will put all his effort in destroying you. If you stand in his way, he rallies his supporters to make it clear that you will not survive being his opponent.”\\n   \\nJohn Avlon pointed to the intimidation tactics used against Republican legislators who refused to vote for Jordan, including an expletive-filled voicemail left for the wife of one congressman, which CNN’s Jake Tapper played on air. “This is the politics that Donald Trump’s rhetoric has wrought among his supporters in the Republican Party,” wrote Avlon. “It reflects the furious worldview that right wing media sells to keep its listeners addicted to the anger and anxiety, turning much of the GOP into what Utah Sen. Mitt Romney calls ‘a pro-authoritarian party.’”\\n   \\nSE Cupp said, “Republicans are squarely to blame for where they are today, more interested in punishing each other than they are in governing or solving problems. But, what if Democrats somewhere down the line are given an opportunity to step in and restore some functionality to the House?” They should take it, Cupp argued.\\n   \\n      “The American people aren’t stupid — they can see the mess Republicans have created for themselves. But at the end of the day, they’ll grow tired of intransigence and dysfunction in Congress. And eventually, Democrats will get the blame for that, too.”\\n   \\n      Sidney Powell drew fame in the closing days of the Trump administration for her bizarre election-denier claims and her threat to “release the Kraken.”\\n \\n      She never unveiled the promised evidence of fraud in the 2020 election and was instead criminally charged in Fulton County, Georgia, along with Trump and 17 other co-defendants for their alleged attempts to overturn the state’s 2020 election results. On Thursday, Powell “released\\xa0herself from the case by\\xa0pleading guilty\\xa0to six misdemeanor offenses and agreeing to testify truthfully against her codefendants as part of her plea deal,” wrote legal analyst Jennifer Rodgers.\\n   \\n      “Powell’s testimony is hugely important and her plea is a big breakthrough for prosecutors. She is the first cooperating witness who was part of the limited group that met with Trump to craft the plans to overthrow the election.

It is crucial that Trump, as odious and dangerous as I personally find him, have the ability to fully campaign: to criticize his opponent, to criticize the system and to make the case for putting him back in the White House. Principles like the importance of free speech cannot bow to political preferences.”\\n   \\n      “But freedom has never existed without any limitation.”\\n   \\nDavid Goldblatt: The people Olympic host cities don’t want you to see\\n \\nAmy Bass: What Mary Lou Retton will always mean to us\\n \\nAmy Klein: Why ‘Old Dads’ made me so mad\\n \\nJudge Glock: The perfect storm hitting homebuyers\\n \\nHolly Thomas: Bearing the weight of all our hopes, the ‘Frasier’ revival never stood a chance\\n \\nRichie Hofmann: The poet who found truth in death, seasons, teaching and even ‘Schitt’s Creek’\\n \\nAND…\\n \\n      De Niro.

       " {'headline': '\\n      Back-to-back plea deals pose grave legal threat to Donald Trump\\n    ',\n",
       "  'contents': ' \\n      Two stalwart allies of former President Donald Trump flipped against him this week, a staggering turn of events that could now pose a grave threat to his ability to fend off criminal charges related to his efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election. \\n   \\n      The rapid-fire developments are a massive boost for prosecutors in Fulton County, Georgia, and the separate but overlapping federal case against Trump that was filed by Justice Department special counsel Jack Smith.  \\n   \\n      The pleas are a stark display of the reality that the Georgia case against Trump and his co-defendants is getting stronger. While Trump has vowed to fight until the bitter end, these newly inked plea deals force his co-defendants to confront the same difficult choice: cut a deal or roll the dice at trial.\\n   \\n      For two prominent Trump co-defendants – Sidney Powell and Kenneth Chesebro – the looming five-month trial, potentially resulting in a yearslong prison sentence, appears to have spurred them into flipping. \\n   \\n      Their decisions to transform from Trump diehards to key witness against him have likely shattered any sense of invincibility that the former president or others charged may be feeling – perhaps for the first time.\\n   \\n      Chesebro pleaded guilty Friday to a felony conspiracy charge, admitting he worked with Trump and other members of the former president’s inner circle to overturn the 2020 election by putting forward slates of fake Republican electors in multiple states that Trump lost.  \\n   \\n      Chesebro directly implicated Trump in a criminal conspiracy, and his plea establishes for the first time that the fake electors plot was illegal. Notably, Chesebro has now admitted that “the purpose” of the fake electors conspiracy was to “disrupt and delay the joint session of Congress on January 6, 2021,” which is a key element of the federal charges Trump is facing.\\n   \\n      As part of the plea, Chesebro established that the fake electors plot was part of “an attempt… to violate” the US Constitution and federal law, by subverting the Electoral College proceedings. This dovetails with the allegations against Trump in Smith’s federal indictment.\\n   \\n      On Thursday, former Trump campaign lawyer Powell pleaded guilty to charges stemming from a separate, but complementary, effort to interfere with the 2020 election by breaching Georgia voting systems.\\n   \\n      While Powell’s guilty plea only covers charges related to the breach of election equipment in Coffee County, Georgia, her deal with prosecutors opens the door for testimony about first-hand interactions with Trump and other key co-defendants. \\n   \\n      For example, if called to the stand in a future trial, Powell could face questions about White House meetings she attended where Trump considered taking extreme steps to overturn the 2020 results, like ordering the Pentagon to seize voting machines.  \\n   \\n      Chesebro similarly agreed to cooperate fully with Fulton County investigators as part of his deal – which includes testifying against Trump and other defendants if called as a witness.  \\n   \\n      Trump is the only person charged thus far in the federal case, but both Chesebro and Powell are unindicted co-conspirators. Chesebro has now admitted conspiring with Trump in the same fake elector plot that is featured prominently in the federal case against Trump – which is set for trial in March.  \\n   \\n      Steve Sadow, Trump’s lead counsel in the Georgia election subversion case, responded Friday to Chesebro’s guilty plea by suggesting it was likely motivated by the “looming threat of prison time.”                                                                                                                                                                \\n   \\n      He speculated in a statement that Chesebro’s guilty plea “was the result of pressure by Fani Willis and her team, and the prosecution’s looming threat of prison time.”\\n   \\n      Trump’s attorney also pointed out that prosecutors dismissed Chesebro’s separate racketeering charge that underpins the indictment against all 19 co-defendants, including the former president. Prosecutors have now dropped that RICO charge against all three defendants who have already taken plea deals.\\n   \\n      But just because a onetime Trump loyalist has decided to help prosecutors go after him, that doesn’t mean the former president is doomed.\\n   \\n      Back in 2018, Trump’s ex-lawyer Michael Cohen struck a plea deal with federal prosecutors and implicated Trump in an illegal campaign finance conspiracy – but the Justice Department never charged Trump with that alleged crime. But Cohen has cooperated with New York state investigators and is set to testify against Trump next week at Trump’s civil business fraud trial there. \\n   \\n      Sadow brushed off the threat of possible testimony from Chesebro and Powell at Trump’s eventual trial on the Georgia election subversion charges.\\n   \\n      “Once again, I fully expect that truthful testimony would be favorable to my defense strategy,” Sadow said.  \\n   \\nThis story has been updated with additional information.\\n',\n",

       " {'headline': '\\n      Redistricting fights in these 10 states could determine which party controls the US House\\n    ',\n",
       "  'contents': ' \\n      Around the country, politicians are waging high-stakes battles over new congressional lines that could influence which party controls the US House of Representatives after the 2024 election.\\n   \\n      In North Carolina, the Republicans who control the state legislature have crafted a map that could help them flip at least three seats. Democrats, meanwhile, could pick up seats in legal skirmishes now playing out in New York, Louisiana, Georgia and other states.\\n   \\n      In all, the fate of anywhere from 14 to 18 House seats across nearly a dozen states could turn on the results of these fights. Republicans currently hold just a five-seat edge in the US House. That razor-edge majority has been underscored in recent weeks by the GOP’s chaotic struggle to elect a new speaker. \\n   \\n      “Given that the majority is so narrow, every outcome matters to the fight for House control in 2024,” said David Wasserman, who follows redistricting closely as senior editor and elections analyst for The Cook Political Report with Amy Walter.\\n   \\n      And with fewer competitive districts that swing between the political parties, Wasserman added, “every line change is almost existential.”\\n   \\n      Experts say several other factors have helped lead to the slew of consequential – and unresolved – redistricting disputes, just months before the first primaries of the 2024 cycle.\\n   \\n      They include pandemic-related delays in completing the 2020 census – the once-a-decade population count that kicks off congressional and state legislative redistricting – as well as a 2019 Supreme Court ruling that threw decisions about partisan gerrymandering back to state courts.\\n   \\n      In addition, some litigation had been frozen in place until the US Supreme Court’s surprise ruling in June, which found that a Republican-crafted redistricting plan in Alabama disadvantaged Black voters in the state and was in violation of the landmark 1965 Voting Rights Act.\\n   \\n      That decision “is functionally reanimating all of these dormant cases,” said Adam Kincaid, the president and executive director of the National Republican Redistricting Trust, which supports the GOP’s redistricting efforts.\\n   \\n      Kincaid said it’s too soon to tell whether Republicans or Democrats will emerge with the advantage by Election Day 2024. In his view, either party could gain or lose only about two seats over redistricting.\\n   \\n      In many of the closely watched states where action is pending, just a single seat hangs in the balance, with two notable exceptions: North Carolina and New York, where multiple seats are at stake. Republicans control the map-drawing in the Tar Heel State, while the job could fall to Democrats in New York, potentially canceling out each party’s gains.\\n   \\n      “Democrats kind of need to run the table in the rest of these states” to gain any edge, said Nick Seabrook, a political scientist at the University of North Florida and the author of the 2022 book “One Person, One Vote: A Surprising History of Gerrymandering in America.”\\n   \\n      Here’s a state-by-state look at recent and upcoming redistricting disputes that could shape the 2024 race for control of the US House:\\n   \\n      In one of the cycle’s highest-profile redistricting cases, a three-judge panel in Alabama approved a map that creates a second congressional district with a substantial Black population. Before the court action, Alabama – which is 27% Black – had only one Black-majority congressional district out of seven seats.\\n   \\n      The fight over the map went all the way to the Supreme Court – which issued a surprise ruling, affirming a lower-court opinion that ordered Alabama to include a second Black-majority district or “something quite close to it.” Under the map that will be in place for the 2024 election, the state’s 2nd District now loops into Mobile to create a seat where nearly half the population is Black.\\n   \\n      The high court’s 5-4 decision in June saw two conservatives, Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Brett Kavanaugh, side with the three liberals to uphold the lower-court ruling. Their action kept intact a key pillar of the Voting Rights Act: that it’s illegal to draw maps that effectively keep Black voters from electing a candidate of their choice.\\n   \\n      The ruling has reverberated around the country and could affect the outcome of similar court cases underway in Louisiana and Georgia that center on whether Republican-drawn maps improperly diluted Black political power in those states.\\n   \\n      Given that Black voters in Alabama have traditionally backed Democrats, the party now stands a better chance of winning the newly reconfigured district and sending to of its members to Congress after next year’s elections. \\n   \\n      The new map – approved in recent days by the lower-court judges – also could result in two Black US House members from Alabama serving together for the first time in state history. \\n   \\n      A state judge in September struck down congressional lines for northern Florida that had been championed by Gov. Ron DeSantis, ruling that the Republican governor’s map had improperly diluted Black voting power. \\n   \\n      This case, unlike the Alabama fight decided by the US Supreme Court, centers on provisions in the state constitution.\\n   \\n      The judge concluded that the congressional boundaries – which essentially dismantled a seat once held by Al Lawson, a Black Democrat, that connected Black communities across a northern reach of the Florida – violated the state’s Fair Districts amendments, enacted by voters. One amendment specifically bars the state from drawing a district that diminishes the ability of racial minorities “to elect representatives of their choice.” \\n   \\n      Arguments before an appeals court are slated for later this month, with litigants seeking a decision by late November. The case is expected to land before the all-Republican state Supreme Court, where DeSantis appointees hold most seats.\\n   \\n      A separate federal case – which argues that the map violates the US Constitution – is pending.\\n   \\n      But observers say the outcome of the state litigation is more likely than the federal case to determine whether Florida lawmakers must restore the North Florida district, given the state constitution’s especially strong protections for the voting rights of racial minorities and the lower burden of proof required to establish that those rights were abridged.\\n   \\n      A redistricting case in the Peach State recently decided by a federal judge could result in an additional seat for Democrats. \\n   \\n      US District Judge Steve Jones has ordered state lawmakers to draw a new congressional map by December 8, arguing that the Republican-controlled legislature improperly diluted the political power of Black voters in their establishment of district boundaries following the 2020 census.\\n   \\n      In his ruling, Jones said state lawmakers had violated the Voting Rights Act\\n   \\n      “The Court commends Georgia for the great strides that it has made to increase the political opportunities of Black voters in the 58 years since the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965,” Jones wrote. “Despite these great gains, the Court determines that in certain areas of the State, the political process is not equally open to Black voters.”\\n   \\n      Jones wrote that minorities accounted for “all” of the state’s population growth over the past decade but that “the number of majority-Black congressional and legislative districts remained the same.” \\n   \\n      Currently, Republicans hold nine of the 14 seats in Georgia’s congressional delegation. Black people make up a majority, or close to it, in four districts, including three in the Atlanta area. \\n   \\n      In 2022, Jones preliminarily ruled that some parts of the Republicans’ redistricting plan likely violated federal law but allowed the map to be used in that year’s midterm elections.\\n   \\n      A separate federal case in Georgia challenges the congressional map on constitutional grounds and is slated to go to trial in November.\\n   \\n      The Kentucky Supreme Court could soon decide whether a map drawn by the state’s Republican-controlled legislature amounts to what Democrats assert is an “extreme partisan” gerrymander in violation of the state’s constitution.\\n   \\n      Much of the case focuses on disputes over state legislative maps, but the congressional lines also are at stake, with critics saying lawmakers moved Kentucky’s capital city – Democratic-leaning Frankfort – out of the 6th Congressional District and into an oddly shaped – and solidly Republican – 1st District to help shore up Republican odds of holding the 6th District.\\n   \\n      The 6th District, represented by GOP Rep. Andy Barr, was one of the more competitive seats in Kentucky under its previous lines. (Democrat Amy McGrath came within 3 points of beating Barr in 2018; last year, Barr won a sixth term under the new lines by 29 points.)\\n   \\n      A lower-court judge already has ruled that the Republican-drawn map does not violate the state’s constitution. \\n   \\n      The Supreme Court’s decision in Alabama could pave the way for a new congressional map in Louisiana ahead of the 2024 election, but the case has quickly become mired in appeals.\\n   \\n      Although Black people make up roughly a third of the state’s population, Louisiana has just one Black lawmaker in its six-member congressional delegation. \\n   \\n      A federal judge threw out the state’s Republican-drawn map in 2022, saying it likely violated the Voting Rights Act. Republican officials in the state appealed to the US Supreme Court, which put the lower-court ruling on hold until it decided the Alabama case, which it did in June this year. \\n   \\n      Once the high court weighed in on the Alabama case, the legal skirmishes again lurched to life in Louisiana.\\n   \\n      Louisiana Republicans have filed an appeal with the 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals and successfully halted a district court hearing to discuss imposing a new, court-ordered map. \\n   \\n      On Thursday, the US Supreme Court declined to allow the federal district judge to move forward with discussions about drawing a new map while the appeal advances through the courts.\\n   \\n      GOP state officials say, among other things, that they are seeking time to redraw the map themselves. Critics of the state’s original map argue that Republicans are using legal maneuvers to delay a new redistricting plan, which could result in a second Democratic-leaning seat.\\n   \\n      Legal battles that drag on risk judges invoking the so-called Purcell Principle, a doctrine that limits changing voting procedures and boundaries too close to Election Day to guard against voter confusion.\\n   \\n      “Some of the reason it becomes too late is because, in many of these cases, the state is prolonging the litigation … and buying more time with an illegal map,” said Kareem Crayton, senior director for voting and representation at the liberal-leaning Brennan Center for Justice.\\n   \\n      Republicans in New Mexico say the congressional lines drawn by the Democrats who control state government amount to an illegal gerrymander under the state’s constitution.\\n   \\n      At stake: a swing district along the US border with Mexico. If Republicans prevail, the seat – now held by a Democratic Rep. Gabe Vasquez – could become more favorable to Republicans.\\n   \\n      A state judge recently upheld the map drawn by Democrats, but the New Mexico Supreme Court is expected to review that order on appeal.\\n   \\n      Republicans flipped four US House seats in New York in the 2022 midterm elections, victories that helped secure their party’s majority in the chamber.\\n   \\n      Current legal fights in the Empire State over redistricting, however, could erase those gains.\\n   \\n      A state court judge oversaw last year’s process of drawing the current map following a long legal battle and the inability of New York’s bipartisan redistricting commission to agree on new lines. But Democrats scored a court victory earlier this year when a state appellate court ruled that the redistricting commission should draw new lines. \\n   \\n      Republicans have appealed that decision, and oral arguments are set for mid-November before New York’s Court of Appeals, the state’s highest court. The commission’s map-making also is on hold.\\n   \\n      If Democrats prevail, it could make it easier for their party to pick up as many as six seats now held by Republicans.\\n   \\n      North Carolina’s legislature, where Republicans hold a supermajority, has drawn new congressional lines that observers say could prove a windfall for the GOP and boost the party’s chances of retaining its House majority next year.\\n   \\n      The state’s current House delegation is split 7-7 between Democrats and Republicans.\\n   \\n      A map that state lawmakers recently approved puts three House Democrats in what one expert called “almost impossible to win” districts.\\n   \\n      The affected Democrats are Reps. Jeff Jackson, who currently represents a Charlotte-area district; Wiley Nickel, who holds a Raleigh-area seat; and Kathy Manning, who represents Greensboro and other parts of north-central North Carolina.\\n   \\n      A fourth Democrat, Rep. Don Davis, saw his district retooled to become more friendly toward Republicans while remaining competitive for both parties.\\n   \\n      State-level gains in the 2022 midterm elections have given the GOP new sway over redistricting in this swing state. Last year, Republicans flipped North Carolina’s Supreme Court, whose members are chosen in partisan elections. The new GOP majority on the court this year tossed out a 2022 ruling by the then-Democratic leaning court against partisan gerrymandering.\\n   \\n      A map that had been created after the Democratic-led high court’s ruling resulted in the current even split in the state’s House delegation.\\n   \\n      Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper does not have veto power over redistricting legislation.\\n   \\n      A redistricting case pending before the US Supreme Court centers on the future of a Charleston-area seat held by Republican Rep. Nancy Mace, who made headlines recently for joining House GOP hard-liners in voting to remove Kevin McCarthy as speaker.\\n   \\n      Earlier this year, a three-judge panel concluded that lines for the coastal 1st Congressional District, as drawn by state GOP lawmakers, amounted to an unconstitutional racial gerrymander.\\n   \\n      The Republican lawmakers appealed to the US Supreme Court. And, during oral arguments earlier this month, several justices in the court’s conservative majority expressed skepticism that South Carolina officials had engaged in an improper racial gerrymander and seemed inclined to reinstate the lawmakers’ map.\\n   \\n      The state Supreme Court, in a case it heard in July, is considering whether it even has the authority to weigh in on map-drawing decisions by the GOP-controlled state legislature.\\n   \\n      Republican state officials argue that the court’s power over redistricting decisions is limited.\\n   \\n      Advocacy groups and a handful of voters are challenging a congressional map that further carved up Democratic-leaning Salt Lake County between four decidedly Republican districts.\\n   \\n      Doing so, the plaintiffs argued in their lawsuit, “takes a slice of Salt Lake County and grafts it onto large swaths of the rest of Utah,” allowing Republican voters in rural areas and smaller cities far away from Salt Lake to “dictate the outcome of elections.”\\n   \\n      Redistricting fights over congressional maps are ongoing in several other states – ranging from Texas to Tennessee – but those cases might not be resolved in time to affect next year’s elections.\\n   \\nThis story has been updated with additional information. \\n',\n",

       " {'headline': '\\n      Kenneth Chesebro: Pro-Trump lawyer pleads guilty in Georgia election subversion case, implicates Trump in fake elector conspiracy\\n    ',\n",
       "  'contents': ' \\n      Kenneth Chesebro, an attorney who helped orchestrate the Trump campaign’s 2020 fake electors plot, pleaded guilty Friday in the Georgia election subversion case to being part of a conspiracy alongside former President Donald Trump and others.\\n   \\n      The plea deal is another blow to Trump and a major victory for Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis, who charged Trump and 18 others in the effort to overturn the 2020 presidential election. It comes one day after former Trump campaign lawyer Sidney Powell also pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors. \\n   \\n      Chesebro pleaded guilty to one felony – conspiracy to commit filing false documents. Fulton County prosecutors recommended that he serve 5 years of probation and pay $5,000 in restitution, and Fulton County Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee imposed that sentence at Friday’s hearing. \\n   \\n      Chesebro has also agreed to testify in future court proceedings.\\n   \\n      As part of his plea deal, Chesebro admitted that he conspired to put forward fake GOP electors in Georgia with Trump and former Trump lawyers Rudy Giuliani and John Eastman. Giuliani and Eastman have both pleaded not guilty in the Georgia case, and now face the prospect of Chesebro taking the witness stand against them. \\n   \\n      The plea came shortly after jury selection in the trial began Friday morning as planned, but was short-lived. A source familiar with the discussions said the likelihood of Chesebro taking a deal increased after Powell made a surprise turn and pleaded guilty on Thursday. \\n   \\n      An attorney who worked to undermine the results of the 2020 election, Chesebro helped develop the Trump’s campaign’s plot to put forward unauthorized slates of GOP electors in Georgia and six other states. (In previous court filings, Chesebro’s lawyers have denied that he devised the plan.)\\n   \\n      He wrote a series of memos in 2020 spelling out what the pro-Trump electors should do in their respective states. In one memo Chesebro acknowledged that he was promoting a “controversial strategy” that even the Supreme Court with its conservative supermajority would “likely” reject. \\n   \\n      Chesebro and other Trump allies hoped then-Vice President Mike Pence would use the GOP electors to justify delaying Congress from certifying Joe Biden’s victory – or even throw out Biden’s lawful electors and recognize the fake GOP slates instead on January 6, 2021.\\n   \\n      Prosecutors said in court that Chesebro acknowledged in the plea that he “created and distributed false Electoral College documents” to Trump operatives in Georgia and other states, and that he worked “in coordination with” the Trump campaign. \\n   \\n      “The defendant provided detailed instructions to co-conspirators in Georgia and other states for creating and distributing these false documents,” prosecutor Daysha Young said at the plea hearing Friday. \\n   \\n      Chesebro was originally charged with seven crimes, including a violation of Georgia’s RICO act, conspiracy to commit forgery and conspiracy to commit impersonating a public officer. Six of the seven felony charges were dropped as part of the deal. \\n   \\n      In addition to testifying at future trials, Chesebro agreed to write an apology letter to the citizens of Georgia. \\n   \\n      Three defendants have now pleaded guilty in the sprawling racketeering case: Chesebro, Powell and Georgia-based bail bondsman Scott Hall.\\n   \\n      Powell and Hall both admitted their roles in the January 2021 breach of election systems in rural Coffee County, Georgia. As part of her plea deal, Powell agreed to testify at future trials, which could hurt Trump’s defense. Both Powell and Hall were sentenced to probation. \\n   \\n      Ahead of their scheduled trial, Chesebro and Powell lost several bids to get the case thrown out, including earlier this week. In a spate of pretrial rulings, McAfee rejected their arguments that Fulton County prosecutors misapplied Georgia’s RICO law and that the indictment failed to establish key elements of the crimes that have been charged.\\n   \\n      Both Powell and Chesebro are unindicted co-conspirators in Trump’s federal election subversion case, which was brought by Justice Department special counsel Jack Smith. Trump’s federal trial is set for March 2024 in Washington, DC.  \\n   \\n      Steve Sadow, lead counsel for Trump in the Georgia case, said he believes Friday’s developments will help the former president.\\n   \\n      “It appears to me that the guilty plea to count 15 of the Fulton County indictment was the result of pressure by Fani Willis and her team and the prosecution’s looming threat of prison time,” Sadow said. “However, it is very important for everyone to note that the RICO charge and every other count was dismissed. Once again, I fully expect that truthful testimony would be favorable to my defense strategy.”\\n   \\n      Hundreds of potential jurors for the Chesebro trial were summoned to the Fulton County courthouse on Friday, where they filled out questionnaires that were designed to weed out people with conflicts-of-interest or anyone who couldn’t act impartially.\\n   \\n      CNN overheard a court official reading aloud from portions the jury questionnaire in a public area of the courthouse where the jury selection process was taking place. The questionnaire itself has not been made public.  \\n   \\n      The potential jurors were asked if they “express divisive political opinions,” if they ever attended a Trump rally or any “MAGA events,” or posted anything online about “Donald Trump’s charges.”\\n   \\n      They were also asked specifically if they watched the highly publicized January 6 committee hearings last year, which presented in dramatic fashion how Trump tried to overturn the election.  \\n   \\n      The potential jurors were also asked if they voted in any federal elections over the past 15 years. There is no indication that they were asked who they voted for, and that is never typically part of a jury questionnaire. \\n   \\n      At a hearing earlier this week, Fulton County prosecutors and attorneys for Chesebro haggled over how many politically charged questions should be included. Specifically, Chesebro’s attorneys wanted to include questions that could tease out how jurors feel about “MAGA Republicans” and Trump’s attempt to “steal the election.” It’s unclear if those questions made it into the questionnaire. \\n   \\n      After Chesebro’s plea, McAfee returned to the jury room to dismiss the jury pool, which responded with applause and cheers.\\n \\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.\\n',\n",

Much of what is known about embryo development comes from animals such as mice, rabbits, chickens and frogs, with research on human embryos very tightly controlled and regulated in most countries.\\n   \\n      But animal studies can only tell researchers so much. What happens during human embryo development, particularly in the crucial first month, remains largely unknown.\\n   \\n      “The drama is in the first month, the remaining eight months of pregnancy are mainly lots of growth,” said Jacob Hanna, a professor of stem cell biology and embryology at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel. “But that first month is still largely a black box.”\\n   \\n      Being able to peer into that black box would open up a world of biomedical possibilities, allowing scientists to demystify a previously obscure window of embryo development — ultimately leading to a better understanding of miscarriages, congenital birth defects and the side effects of medications taken during pregnancy. And some researchers believe they’ve found a way to do it that bypasses the need for eggs or sperm.\\n   \\n      Harnessing advances in stem cells, labs around the world are making embryo-like structures — a group of cells that acts like an embryo but can’t grow into a fetus.\\n   \\n      Recent breakthroughs in the field, the culmination of years of painstaking lab work, have generated hope and some alarm, raising urgent questions\\xa0about the ethical status of these models, to what extent they should be treated like human embryos and whether they are open to misuse.\\n   \\n      The embryo-like structures are essentially clumps of cells grown in a lab, which are smaller than a grain of rice and represent the very earliest stages of human development, before any organs have formed. They don’t have a beating heart or a brain.\\n   \\n      The most advanced models, revealed in September by an Israeli team that Hanna was part of, show all the cell types that are essential for an embryo’s development — the placenta, yolk sac, chorionic sac (outer membrane) and other tissues that an embryo needs to develop.\\n   \\n      The structures were left to develop for eight days — reaching a developmental stage equivalent to day 14 of a human embryo in the womb — an important moment when natural embryos acquire the internal structures that enable them to proceed to the next stage: developing the progenitors of body organs.\\n   \\n      Hanna said\\xa0they were the most accurate models developed so far and, unlike those created by other teams, no genetic modification had been made to turn on the genes necessary to generate the different types of cells, only chemical nudges.\\n   \\n      “It’s not only you put the cells together, and they’re there,” he said. “But you see the architecture, you start also seeing very fine details,” Hanna said.\\n   \\n      Hanna’s team made no use of fertilized eggs. They started out with human cells known as pluripotent stem cells, which have the potential to be programmed into many cell types and are widely used in biomedical research. Some of them were derived from adult human skin cells.\\n   \\n      The team then reprogrammed these cells into what they term a “naïve state” — corresponding to day seven in the development of a natural human embryo, around the time it implants itself in the womb. These “naïve” cells were divided into three groups.\\n   \\n      One group, intended to become the embryo, was left untouched. The two other groups were “nudged” with the use of certain chemicals that turn on specific genes to develop into the tissues needed to sustain the embryo, such as the placenta. After two days, the three groups are then put together, Hanna said.\\n   \\n      “In the first three days, you don’t see much, you just see a clump of cells that is growing,” he explained. “But by day four, you start seeing … this has a structure, you know, you can see where the embryo is going to form … and see where the yolk sac is going to be.”\\n   \\n      At the stage equivalent to day seven, the synthetic human embryo models were aggregates of about 120 cells, together measuring some 0.01 millimeter across. By day 14, they contained about 2,500 cells and measured 0.5 millimeters.\\n   \\n      Hanna and his team say the models faithfully emulate the way an early embryo gains all the structures it needs to begin its transformation into a fetus. The inner organization matched images in embryology atlases produced in the 1960s, and when they applied secretions from the cells to a commercial pregnancy test it came out positive.\\n   \\n      However, only 1% of the aggregated cells went on to self-organize into an embryo-like structure. A much higher percentage would be needed to make the embryo models a useful tool for scientists, something that is possible, Hanna said, but would likely take years to perfect.\\n   \\n      “I think we will be able to learn an awful lot from these stem-cell based embryo models. There are some drawbacks at the minute. They’re very inefficient to make … so clearly the efficiency has to be increased to really\\xa0maximize what we can learn from these models,” said Peter Rugg-Gunn at a news briefing this week. Rugg-Gunn is group leader and head of public engagement at the Babraham Institute, which focuses on life science research.\\n   \\n      To date, none of the embryo models have been grown beyond the equivalent of 14 days, largely because of the limitations and challenges involved in culturing these structures.\\n   \\n      However, 14 days is an important milestone because it is when permitted lab research on cultured human embryos routinely ends. The boundary was established by the United Kingdom’s Fertilisation and Embryology Act in 1990 in the wake of public concern about test tube babies before in vitro fertilization was widely accepted, as well as worries that scientists were ignoring the special moral status of human embryos. The 14-day rule was subsequently adopted by several other countries, eventually becoming an internationally recognized ethical limit.\\n   \\n      This limit, which some scientists want to extend, doesn’t apply to stem-cell based embryo models, which the International Society for Stem Cell Research said should not be considered as embryos. However, the organization did recommend that research involving the models have required ethical oversight. \\n \\n      It’s possible in the future that these models could be used to study human development well beyond the 14-day point. Hanna and other groups have grown mouse embryo models to a later equivalent point. He said, in the future, it might be possible to go as far as 40 days with human embryo models.\\n   \\n      However, dystopian fears that scientists studying the models are trying to create an alternative way to produce human life are the stuff of science fiction, Hanna said.\\n   \\n      “People think immediately we’re trying to, you know, replace pregnancy or gestation with this embryo model, but it’s really not, not only is it not the goal but also I don’t think it’s ever going to be possible,” he said.\\n   \\n      As current research stands, embryo models are still rudimentary, with clear scientific differences from a human embryo and no potential to form a fetus.\\n   \\n      Also, the International Society for Stem Cell Research prohibits the transfer of any embryo model to the uterus of a human or an animal in its guidelines.\\n   \\n      “I want to stress that these models are not embryos and every jurisdiction and society… that’s been looking at this have said it should be illegal to attempt to plant any stem cell-based embryo into a woman or human ones into an animal uterus. That should be forbidden,” said Robin Lovell-Badge, a professor and head of the Laboratory of Stem Cell Biology and Developmental Genetics at the Francis Crick Institute in London, who helped draft the guidelines, at the briefing.\\n   \\n      Many scientists argue that human embryo models, especially if they can be produced in great numbers, offer an ethical alternative to research on scarce and precious human embryos that are usually obtained as a by-product of IVF.\\n   \\n      “Because of their stem cell base, we can scale everything up. We can do experiments on them that we are not able to do on precious, rare (human) embryos. And so it just changes the types of experiments we can do and the questions we can answer,” said Naomi Moris, group leader at the Francis Crick Institute’s Developmental Models Laboratory in London.\\n   \\n      One potential application could be drug screening and research. Pregnant people have often been excluded from drug trials because of concerns about the safety of the parent and unborn child.\\n   \\n      In her lab, Moris has conducted experiments with embryo models to see how they respond to medications like thalidomide, a drug that was once marketed as a treatment for morning sickness that is already known to cause birth defects.\\n \\n      The goal was to find out “are they susceptible to these drugs that we know are going to be toxic to the early embryo and then can we use (the embryo model) to screen drugs we actually don’t know about?” she said.\\n   \\n      Moris agreed that the models shouldn’t be classified as embryos given their stem-cell origins and because they still lack certain features, however, she noted it was impossible to know for sure.\\n   \\n      “We can’t do the golden experiment which would be to put it into uterus and see if it can carry on growing, and without being able to do that experiment — quite rightly — how can we as researchers decide whether we’ve crossed that boundary and tipped over into what we would call an embryo? I think this is a big question. And it’s not an easy one to answer,” Moris said.\\n   \\n      Some in the field envision a “tipping point” wherein human embryo models might be afforded some protection like those surrounding human embryos, as scientific advances diminish the differences between the embryo models and their real-life counterparts.\\n   \\n      It’s also possible that future stem cell-based models could replicate the development of milestones such as the emergence of primitive neural folds, arms buds and early heart-like regions, which may have the potential to develop into beating heart tissue, circulating blood and neurons, according to a paper on the need for national policy and governance on human embryos published in the journal Genetics & Development in August.\\n   \\n      “With yet further advances, it will become increasingly difficult to be certain that the models could not reach the point of pain perception, consciousness or viability,” the paper’s authors noted.\\n   \\n      “Thus the public will soon ask, quite rightly, whether … (embryo models) are appropriately regulated? Are scientists using them in ethically responsible, socially acceptable and suitably accountable ways?”\\n   \\n      Hanna believes that it will be possible to design and genetically modify human embryo structures so that they will be developmentally limited — unable to produce brain cells or heart tissue — allowing scientists to navigate some of the ethical issues.\\n   \\n      Researchers agree that the emerging field needs better regulation as the research advances, addressing what should and should not be permitted.\\n   \\n      “The law is obviously lagging way behind the science and technology,” Moris said.\\n   \\n      “I think that we’re quite keen as researchers to be pushing at the forefront … to get regulation in place,” she added. “Because scientists like working within lines, we feel much more comfortable if we know we’re on the right side of the public perceptions of the field. We’d be a lot happier if we had a clear set of guidelines and regulations that we should all work under.”\\n   \\n      In the UK, the Governance of Stem-Cell Based Embryo Models project, which Moris is involved in, has convened academic researchers, legal scholars, bioethicists and research funders to prepare a set of guidelines for working with the technology. The group expects to publish a draft governance framework in the new year, Moris said.\\n   \\n      Bobbie Farsides, a professor of clinical and biomedical ethics at Brighton and Sussex Medical School, who is also part of that group, said that what was remarkable to her was that scientists themselves are deeply engaged with the ethical issues.\\n   \\n      “When I first worked in these sorts of spaces, it very much felt like society or the public that were worried and the lawyers and the regulators were trying to sort out the scientists,” Farsides said. “What we’ve got now is the scientists themselves saying, ‘OK, how are we going to reassure the public? How are we going to self-regulate? Where are we going to draw red lines?’ And I think that’s a huge sea change.”\\n  ',\n",

Cluster headache attacks can occur every day for six to eight weeks and then go away in a cluster cycle. The theory is that you can actually trigger a cycle by switching the time with Daylight Saving Time.\\n   \\n      The connection between the time change and cluster headaches is that the portion of the brain that is also the generator for cluster headaches is also the portion of the brain that manages our circadian rhythms, which is located in the hypothalamus.\\n   \\n      Also, a lot of migraine sufferers usually will have a little bit of sleep deprivation, or their sleep is affected by this change, so they’ll see an increase in headache frequency during that period.\\n   \\nCNN: Why does Daylight Saving Time have such an impact?\\n \\nDasgupta: Despite being a seemingly small shift, DST can significantly impact our circadian rhythm, which regulates our sleep-wake cycle.\\n   \\n      Sleep is very individualized. Not everyone’s going to be equally affected by the change in our circadian rhythm.

       "  'contents': ' \\nSign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter.\\xa0Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\\n \\n      The James Webb Space Telescope and other observatories witnessed a massive explosion in space that created rare chemical elements, some of which are necessary for life.\\n   \\n      The explosion, observed on March 7, was the second brightest gamma-ray burst ever witnessed by telescopes in more than 50 years of observations, over one million times brighter than the entire Milky Way Galaxy combined. Gamma-ray bursts are short emissions of the most energetic form of light.\\n   \\n      This particular burst, called GRB 230307A, was likely created when two neutron stars — the incredibly dense remnants of stars after a supernova — merged in a galaxy about one billion light-years away. In addition to releasing the gamma-ray burst, the merger created a kilonova, a rare explosion that occurs when a neutron star merges with another neutron star or a black hole, according to a study published Wednesday in the journal Nature.\\n   \\n      “There are only a mere handful of known kilonovas, and this is the first time we have been able to look at the aftermath of a kilonova with the James Webb Space Telescope,” said lead study author Andrew Levan, astrophysics professor at Radboud University in the Netherlands. Levan was also part of the team that made the first detection of a kilonova in 2013.\\n   \\n      In addition to Webb, NASA’s Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory, and the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite observed the burst and traced it back to the neutron star merger. Webb was also used to detect the chemical signature of tellurium within the aftermath of the explosion.\\n   \\n      Tellurium, a rare metalloid, is used to tint glass and ceramics and has a role in the manufacturing process of rewritable CDs and DVDs, according to the Royal Society of Chemistry. Astronomers expect that other elements close to tellurium on the periodic table, including iodine, which is necessary for much of life on Earth, is likely to be present in the material released by the kilonova.\\n   \\n      “Just over 150 years since Dmitri Mendeleev wrote down the periodic table of elements, we are now finally in the position to start filling in those last blanks of understanding where everything was made, thanks to Webb,” Levan said.\\n   \\n      Astronomers have long believed that neutron star mergers are the celestial factories that create rare elements heavier than iron. But it’s been difficult to track down the evidence.\\n   \\n      Kilonovae are rare events, which makes them difficult to observe. But astronomers look for short gamma-ray bursts, which only last about two seconds at the longest, as the telltale byproducts of the scarce events.\\n   \\n      What was unusual about this burst is that it lasted for 200 seconds, making it a long gamma-ray burst. Such extended bursts are usually associated with supernovas created when massive stars explode.\\n   \\n      “This burst is way into the long category. It’s not near the border. But it seems to be coming from a merging neutron star,” said study coauthor Eric Burns, assistant professor of physics and astronomy at Louisiana State University, in a statement.\\n   \\n      Fermi initially detected the gamma-ray burst, and astronomers used ground- and space-based observatories to track the changes in brightness during the aftermath of the explosion in gamma-ray, X-ray, visible, infrared and radio waves of light. The quick changes in visible and infrared light suggested it was a kilonova.\\n   \\n      “This type of explosion is very rapid, with the material in the explosion also expanding swiftly,” said study coauthor Om Sharan Salafia, a researcher at the National Institute for Astrophysics’ Brera Astronomical Observatory in Italy, in a statement. “As the whole cloud expands, the material cools off quickly and the peak of its light becomes visible in infrared, and becomes redder on timescales of days to weeks.”\\n   \\n      The team also used Webb to trace the journey of the neutron stars before they exploded.\\n   \\n      Once, they were two massive stars in a binary system that existed in a spiral galaxy. One of the pair exploded as a supernova, leaving behind a neutron star, and then the same thing happened to the other star. These explosive events launched the stars from their galaxy and they remained as a pair, traveling for 120,000 light-years before merging several hundred million years after being ejected from their home.\\n   \\n      Astronomers have been trying to determine how chemical elements are created in the universe for decades.\\n   \\n      Discovering more kilonovas in the future with sensitive telescopes like Webb and the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope, set to launch in 2027, could provide insights into which heavy elements are created and released by the rare explosions.\\n   \\n      The researchers also want to find more mergers that create longer gamma-ray bursts to determine what drives them and whether there is any connection to the elements created in the process.\\n   \\n      The violent life cycle of stars has distributed the elements found on the periodic table throughout the universe, including those necessary for life to form on Earth in the first place. The ability to study stellar explosions like kilonovas in recent years is enabling scientists to answer questions about the formation of chemical elements, allowing for a deeper understanding of how the universe has evolved over time.\\n \\n      “Webb provides a phenomenal boost and may find even heavier elements,” said study coauthor Ben Gompertz, assistant professor at the Institute for Gravitational Wave Astronomy and the School of Physics and Astronomy at the University of Birmingham in the United Kingdom, in a statement.\\n   \\n      “As we get more frequent observations, the models will improve and the spectrum may evolve more in time,” Gompertz said. “Webb has certainly opened the door to do a lot more, and its abilities will be completely transformative for our understanding of the universe.”\\n  ',\n",

       "  'contents': ' \\nSign up for CNN’s Wonder Theory science newsletter.\\xa0Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\\n \\n      Declassified photos captured by United States spy satellites launched during the Cold War have revealed an archaeological treasure trove: hundreds of previously unknown Roman-era forts, in what is now Iraq and Syria.\\n   \\n      Many of those long-lost structures may be gone forever at this point, destroyed or damaged over recent decades due to agricultural expansion, urban development and war. Nevertheless, the discovery of the forts’ existence challenges a popular hypothesis established in the 1930s about the role of such fortifications along the ancient Roman Empire’s eastern border, researchers reported Wednesday in the journal Antiquity.\\n   \\n      Based on the satellite views, the high number of forts and their widespread distribution hints that the forts may not have been erected to keep enemies out, as the decades-old theory suggested. Rather, the structures were likely built to ensure safe passage for caravans and travelers along routes that saw plenty of nonmilitary traffic. These forts, according to the study authors, were outposts and havens, not hostile barriers.\\n   \\n      High-resolution images analyzed in the new study were taken during flyovers by multiple satellites belonging to two US military programs: the Corona Project (1960 to 1972) and Hexagon (1971 to 1986). Corona’s images were declassified in 1995, and Hexagon’s photos were released to the public in 2011.\\n   \\n      Images from Hexagon and Corona are invaluable for archaeologists because they preserve snapshots of landscapes that have since undergone significant disruption, said lead study author Jesse Casana, an archaeologist and professor in the department of anthropology at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire.\\n   \\n      “Agriculture and urbanization have destroyed a lot of archaeological sites and features to a shocking degree,” Casana told CNN. “This old imagery allows us to see things that are often either obscured or no longer extant today.”\\n   \\n      Satellite images are especially helpful for searches across the northern part of the Fertile Crescent in the Middle East — from the eastern coast of the Mediterranean to western Iran\\xa0— because of the area’s archaeological importance and high visibility of the ground in photos, Casana added.\\n   \\n      The research team pored over the images for signs of Roman forts, which have a distinctive square shape and walls that usually measure about 164 to 262 feet (50 to 80 meters) long. The scientists began their search using reference maps from an aerial survey of the region conducted in the 1920s and 1930s by French archaeologist and Jesuit missionary Father Antoine Poidebard. That survey was among the first to photograph archaeological sites from the air, and in 1934 Poidebard reported finding 116 Roman forts.\\n   \\n      It was an unprecedented achievement. But nearly a century later, mapping Poidebard’s forts to satellite photos was challenging. Because his map wasn’t large-scale, it contained numerous spatial errors, Casana said. Poidebard also did not provide names or numbers for most of the forts he found, identifying them instead by their proximity to geologic features.\\n   \\n      Those forts were aligned north to south along what was once the easternmost boundary of the Roman Empire, according to Poidebard. This arrangement, he claimed, was surely intended to guard against invaders from the east.\\n   \\n      But Poidebard’s survey provided only a partial view of Rome’s ancient infrastructure, the researchers found. What he overlooked — and what the satellite photos revealed — was that the north-to-south line of 116 forts was actually only a narrow sliver of a cluster spreading from east to west and containing 396 fortified structures.\\n   \\n      The forts spanned approximately 116,000 square miles (300,000 square kilometers), “extending from Mosul, on the Tigris River in Iraq, through Ninawa province, across the Khabur and the Balikh valleys, continuing to the semi-arid plains west of the Euphrates River, leading to western Syria and the Mediterranean,” according to the study.\\n   \\n      When the archaeologists performed a second survey of an image subset, they found 106 more fortlike structures, hinting that further investigations will yield many more Roman forts. Based on excavations of other Roman sites in the region, the scientists estimated that the forts were built between the second and sixth centuries.\\n   \\n      While Poidebard’s row of forts along the Roman Empire’s eastern front looked like a military fortification, this new evidence suggested that the forts collectively served a different purpose. Rather than presenting an impassable wall on a violent frontier, they provided oases of safety and order along well-traveled Roman roads.\\n   \\n      Borders in this world “were places of dynamic cultural exchange and movement of goods and ideas,” not barriers, Casana said. And perhaps that perspective holds a lesson for the modern era, he added.\\n   \\n      “Historically, as an archaeologist, I can say that there have been many attempts by ancient states to build walls across borders and it has been a universal failure,” Casana said. “If there’s any way that archaeology contributes to modern discourse, I would hope it is that building giant walls to keep people out is a bad plan.”\\n   \\nMindy Weisberger is a science writer and media producer whose work has appeared in Live Science, Scientific American and How It Works magazine.\\n',\n",

More than a decade later, it remains one of her most popular tunes. Her artistry, as well as that of many others who have mastered the art of tugging at our heartstrings with slow and emotional beats, has a way of managing the emotional pain of heartbreak and loss.\\n   \\n      There is no doubt that music can soothe the soul for some, and it turns out that it could also be a temporary soother for physical pain.\\n   \\n      Listening to favorite songs could reduce people’s perception of pain, according to a new study published Wednesday in the journal Frontiers in Pain Research. And the most effective pain relievers were found to be sad songs detailing bittersweet and emotional experiences.\\n   \\n      “It doesn’t take the place of Tylenol when you have a headache, but music can help take the edge off,” said Patrick Stroman, a professor of biomedical and molecular sciences at Queen’s University in Kingston, Ontario. He was not involved in the latest study but has conducted his own research on the relationship between pain and music. Unlike other medications, he noted, there is no side effect or risk to listening to music (just keep the volume at a reasonable level).\\n   \\n      The small study invited 63 young adults to bring two of their favorite songs, and the only requirement was that they needed to be at least 3 minutes and 20 seconds long. One selection represented their favorite music of all time, and the other was the song they would bring with them on a desert island. The researchers also had the young adults pick one of seven songs that the team considered relaxing and were unfamiliar to the study participants. (The seven they could choose from were “Cotton Blues,” “Jamaicare,” “Légende Celtique,” “Musique de Film,” “Nuit Cubaine,” “Reggae Calédonien” and “Sega Mizik Kèr.”)\\n   \\n      Each person underwent 7-minute blocks where they were instructed to stare at a monitor screen while listening to their favorite music, one of the seven relaxing instrumental songs (each of which lasted for 6 minutes and 40 seconds), or a scrambled version of both songs and the relaxing song chosen. The scrambled music was a noisy jumble of all three songs, cut into fragments and randomly shuffled so that they lacked their original structure. One 7-minute block had people sitting in silence. All the while, the researchers stuck a hot object — similar to the pain of a boiling hot teacup on your skin — to the participants’ left inner forearms.\\n   \\n      When rating their experiences, people were more likely to report feeling less pain when listening to their favorite songs compared with hearing the unfamiliar relaxing song or silence. The scrambled songs did not reduce pain either, which the authors suggested was evidence of music being more than a distraction from an unpleasant experience.\\n   \\n      With millions of songs available, one person’s favorite song is likely not the same as another. After interviewing the participants about the song they brought and their rating of pain, the researchers found people who listened to bittersweet and moving songs felt less pain than when they listened to songs with calming or cheerful themes.\\n   \\n      “It’s a very cool result,” said lead study author Darius Valevicius, a doctoral student of neurosciences at the University of Montreal. “I think it’s something that myself and probably many people intuitively pick up on why we listen to bittersweet, melancholic or even spiritual music.”\\n   \\n      People who listened to bittersweet songs also reported more chills — the thrill and shivers you get on your skin from listening to pleasurable music. This sensation was associated with lower ratings of unpleasantness elicited by the burning pain they felt in the experiment. While not thoroughly studied here, Valevicius said he thought those musical chills could be causing these pain-blocking effects.\\n   \\n      While he didn’t research chills in this study, Valevicius hypothesized that these sensations might be signs of sensory gating. To prevent overloading the brain with every stimulus around a person, the brain filters out any it considers redundant or irrelevant. In this case, the brain might be tuning into the music and filtering out some messages of incoming pain. While our bodies still feel the pain, the messages to make our conscious mind perceive the pain may not be relayed.\\n   \\nWATCH: Scientists turned spiderwebs into music and it sounds like a nightmare\\n \\n      Your brain on music is likely tapping into the body’s built-in system for regulating pain, Stroman said. The body’s ability to engage emotions and feelings helps to gauge how important the pain is at that moment. Stroman and his research team recently used brain imaging to capture what goes on in the central nervous system when people are exposed to pain while listening to music. The researchers observed music-altering brain connectivity across multiple brain regions involved in pain, memory and processing subjective emotional states.\\n   \\n      “When people are listening to music they enjoy, by our measurements it can reduce the pain that we’re feeling by 10%,” he said. Stroman cautioned, however, that this behavior is not enough of an analgesic to avoid medication or medical services.\\n   \\n      Still, there is nothing wrong with picking a more upbeat song if that is your preference. Music provides many other health benefits, including stress reduction and a good night’s sleep. Valevicius said he has embraced this balm, stating “I definitely have let myself indulge a little more in listening to music.”\\n   \\nJocelyn Solis-Moreira is a New York-based freelance health and science journalist.\\n',\n",

       " {'headline': '\\n      Snapchat isn’t just for teens anymore. Now it needs to make some real money\\n    ',\n",
       "  'contents': ' \\n      When Snapchat announced last month that it had reached 5 million paying subscribers for its Snapchat+ service, it seemed like a stunning achievement. The milestone marked the halfway point to the 10 million subscriber number that CEO Evan Spiegel had just months earlier identified as a “medium-term” goal.  \\n   \\n      The service’s success in just 15 months after launching proved that despite Snapchat’s reputation as an app used mainly by teens, users are willing to cough up money for a premium experience on the platform. At 5 million subscribers paying $3.99 per month, Snapchat+ is set to earn around $239 million in annual revenue. \\n   \\n      That subscriber number is just a fraction of its overall user base of Snapchat, which has quietly become one of the world’s fastest-growing social platforms. As of the end of June, it reported 397 million daily active users — more than X, the platform formerly known as Twitter. The company’s challenge now is figuring out how to successfully monetize those users to turn around a streak of disappointing financial results. When Snap reports earnings next week for the quarter ended in September, it’s expected to post its third consecutive revenue decline. \\n   \\n      Despite having invented some of the most important social media features over the past decade — stories and filters — Snapchat is often thought of as an app mainly for young people with less reach and cultuiral relevance than rivals like TikTok, Instagram and Facebook. But Snapchat’s user growth suggests that the app remains among the most dominant platforms, even as (and perhaps because) it’s charting a different course from most competitors. As other platforms increasingly lean into discoverability and showing users entertaining content from people they don’t know, Snap remains focused on its longtime strategy of connecting users with their real-life social circle. \\n   \\n      “At the end of the day, you have a better time connecting with the people you care about most, and we want to make sure that those connections are enduring and that we can provide experiences to enhance them,” Jack Brody, Snapchat’s vice president of product, told CNN. “By focusing on that, we feel like we’re solving problems that real users face every single day, and creating real, differentiated value.” \\n   \\n      Still, revenue growth hasn’t kept pace with those user gains. In the first six months of this year, Snap’s sales dipped more than 5% compared to the year-ago period, and it posted an operating loss of $769 million. Snap’s (SNAP) shares are down more than 11% since this time last year. \\n   \\n      The sales declines come as Snapchat, like other platforms, works to update its advertising business to cope with changes to Apple’s app tracking policies. And it comes as the company funnels money into innovations in artificial intelligence and augmented reality.  \\n   \\n      Snap has also faced lawsuits from parents alleging the app contributed to their children’s mental health struggles or enabled them to buy illicit drugs, with sometimes fatal outcomes. (Snapchat says it has a range of safety features to protect young users, including restrictions on friend suggestions and requests from strangers, default privacy settings and parental oversight options.)\\n   \\n      Still, analysts say Snap’s user growth continues to represent a major opportunity for the company.  \\n   \\n      “In my view, there’s significant value for a company that’s growing its installed base at this level,” said Angelo Zino, senior equity analyst at CFRA Research. “At the end of the day, when you think about advertisers, they want to go where the eyes are.” \\n   \\n      Snapchat gained popularity following its 2011 launch for the ability to send disappearing photos to friends, with the option to add silly filters. Two years later, Snapchat launched Stories, where users could share a series of photos and videos to all of their friends that would be viewable for only 24 hours, creating demand for more spontaneous, ephemeral types of content across social media.  \\n   \\n      Since then, Snapchat has continued to expand, adding features like a “Discover” section with public content and the Snap Map, where users can see their friends’ locations and public posts from popular locations. The company has also invested in more ambitious, experimental projects like a selfie drone, which it discontinued following mass layoffs last year, and AR glasses, investment in which has also been scaled back. \\n   \\n      But its core mission is to allow users to have more private conversations with their friends. And that’s fueled an ongoing boom in its user numbers. Snapchat has grown its user base by more than 10% year-over-year for the past 16 consecutive quarters. \\n   \\n      “That interpersonal and small group focus is really important and appealing especially to younger social media users who don’t want to broadcast their entire lives to mass audiences,” the way they would on TikTok or Instagram, said Jess Maddox, an assistant professor at the University of Alabama who researches social media platforms and internet popular culture. \\n   \\n      Snapchat says that much of its daily user base is distinct from other platforms, according to a study of 10,000 users conducted on Snap’s behalf by market research firm GWI during the first half of 2023. The group found that 43% of the people aged 16-64 who used Snapchat did not use TikTok, and more than half of daily Snapchatters in the same age range were not using YouTube on a daily basis. \\n   \\n      “Snapchat was really kind of created as an antidote to traditional social media,” Brody said. “This was a platform for connecting with your closest friends, not everybody you’ve ever met … and because of that, people come to Snapchat for a very different reason than why they go to other platforms.” \\n   \\n      Market research firm Insider Intelligence estimated in a June report that Snapchat would overtake TikTok as the fastest growing platform worldwide as of the end of 2023. Already, parent company Snap said at its February investor day that it has 150 million monthly active users in North America — a figure that mirrors the number of users that TikTok says it has in the United States (although TikTok did not specify how often those users are interacting with the app). \\n   \\n      A major portion of that growth is coming from outside of the United States. Snapchat has, for example, made a big push into India, following the country’s TikTok ban in 2020. Users from outside of North America and Europe now make up more than half of Snapchat’s daily active user base and grew at a rate of 25% year-over-year in the second quarter of 2023, compared to 14% overall daily active user growth.  \\n   \\n      Snapchat’s task now: making a meaningful profit from all of those users.  \\n   \\n      “The biggest reason [for its financial challenges] is that when you think about Snap, they are largely a messaging platform, and it is extremely difficult … to monetize messaging platforms,” CFRA’s Zino said. Other major tech companies that operate messaging platforms, including Meta and Apple, don’t count on those services to generate significant revenue, if any.  \\n   \\n      What’s more, advertisers are increasingly looking to invest in so-called “direct response” advertising where users are immediately prompted to buy a product — advertising that is much more easily done on a platform like Instagram where users are already often discussing specific products and it’s easy to link to an advertiser’s website or push users to buy directly on the platform’s e-commerce section. Snapchat, by contrast, has traditionally leaned more heavily into brand awareness, said Scott Kessler, global technology sector lead at research firm Third Bridge, although the company now also gets the majority of its revenue from direct response ads.  \\n   \\n      “While there still is brand advertising online for sure, I think that there are a lot of challenges and a lot of conversations about what this looks like going forward,” Kessler said. “Snap is in a uniquely challenged position because of its historical focus on brand advertising.”  \\n   \\n      Snapchat has also placed a greater emphasis on user privacy than many of its peers — a boon to users but a challenge for advertising, Kessler noted.  \\n   \\n      Engagement time on Snapchat may also play a role — the app has the lowest user time spent compared to social media peers, likely owing to its focus on messaging rather than endless scrolling through content, according to market intelligence firm SensorTower. The average Snapchat user in the third quarter of 2023 spent just 19 minutes per day on the app, compared to 103 minutes per day on TikTok, 60 minutes per day on Instagram and 28 minutes per day on X, SensorTower data shows.  \\n   \\n      But Snapchat says its users are checking in on the app regularly — 40 times a day on average in the United States, according to Brody.  \\n   \\n      Spiegel said during Snap’s July earnings call that following its restructuring last year, which cut 20% of its staff, the company is investing heavily to improve its direct response advertising business. He added that the company’s active advertisers were up 20% year-over-year. \\n   \\n      And Brody says those investments should enable the platform to better capitalize on its user base.   \\n   \\n      “At the end of the day, digital advertising is built on reach and engagement, and we have been growing both steadily,” he said. “It’s been a transition year for us in terms of really rebuilding a lot of the foundational pieces of our ad platform and we’re seeing some really promising signs there. And these ad platforms improvements will allow us to truly capitalize on this opportunity … in the future.” \\n  ',\n",

       " {'headline': '\\n      Snapchat isn’t just for teens anymore. Now it needs to make some real money\\n    ',\n",
       "  'contents': ' \\n      When Snapchat announced last month that it had reached 5 million paying subscribers for its Snapchat+ service, it seemed like a stunning achievement. The milestone marked the halfway point to the 10 million subscriber number that CEO Evan Spiegel had just months earlier identified as a “medium-term” goal.  \\n   \\n      The service’s success in just 15 months after launching proved that despite Snapchat’s reputation as an app used mainly by teens, users are willing to cough up money for a premium experience on the platform. At 5 million subscribers paying $3.99 per month, Snapchat+ is set to earn around $239 million in annual revenue. \\n   \\n      That subscriber number is just a fraction of its overall user base of Snapchat, which has quietly become one of the world’s fastest-growing social platforms. As of the end of June, it reported 397 million daily active users — more than X, the platform formerly known as Twitter. The company’s challenge now is figuring out how to successfully monetize those users to turn around a streak of disappointing financial results. When Snap reports earnings next week for the quarter ended in September, it’s expected to post its third consecutive revenue decline. \\n   \\n      Despite having invented some of the most important social media features over the past decade — stories and filters — Snapchat is often thought of as an app mainly for young people with less reach and cultuiral relevance than rivals like TikTok, Instagram and Facebook. But Snapchat’s user growth suggests that the app remains among the most dominant platforms, even as (and perhaps because) it’s charting a different course from most competitors. As other platforms increasingly lean into discoverability and showing users entertaining content from people they don’t know, Snap remains focused on its longtime strategy of connecting users with their real-life social circle. \\n   \\n      “At the end of the day, you have a better time connecting with the people you care about most, and we want to make sure that those connections are enduring and that we can provide experiences to enhance them,” Jack Brody, Snapchat’s vice president of product, told CNN. “By focusing on that, we feel like we’re solving problems that real users face every single day, and creating real, differentiated value.” \\n   \\n      Still, revenue growth hasn’t kept pace with those user gains. In the first six months of this year, Snap’s sales dipped more than 5% compared to the year-ago period, and it posted an operating loss of $769 million. Snap’s (SNAP) shares are down more than 11% since this time last year. \\n   \\n      The sales declines come as Snapchat, like other platforms, works to update its advertising business to cope with changes to Apple’s app tracking policies. And it comes as the company funnels money into innovations in artificial intelligence and augmented reality.  \\n   \\n      Snap has also faced lawsuits from parents alleging the app contributed to their children’s mental health struggles or enabled them to buy illicit drugs, with sometimes fatal outcomes. (Snapchat says it has a range of safety features to protect young users, including restrictions on friend suggestions and requests from strangers, default privacy settings and parental oversight options.)\\n   \\n      Still, analysts say Snap’s user growth continues to represent a major opportunity for the company.  \\n   \\n      “In my view, there’s significant value for a company that’s growing its installed base at this level,” said Angelo Zino, senior equity analyst at CFRA Research. “At the end of the day, when you think about advertisers, they want to go where the eyes are.” \\n   \\n      Snapchat gained popularity following its 2011 launch for the ability to send disappearing photos to friends, with the option to add silly filters. Two years later, Snapchat launched Stories, where users could share a series of photos and videos to all of their friends that would be viewable for only 24 hours, creating demand for more spontaneous, ephemeral types of content across social media.  \\n   \\n      Since then, Snapchat has continued to expand, adding features like a “Discover” section with public content and the Snap Map, where users can see their friends’ locations and public posts from popular locations. The company has also invested in more ambitious, experimental projects like a selfie drone, which it discontinued following mass layoffs last year, and AR glasses, investment in which has also been scaled back. \\n   \\n      But its core mission is to allow users to have more private conversations with their friends. And that’s fueled an ongoing boom in its user numbers. Snapchat has grown its user base by more than 10% year-over-year for the past 16 consecutive quarters. \\n   \\n      “That interpersonal and small group focus is really important and appealing especially to younger social media users who don’t want to broadcast their entire lives to mass audiences,” the way they would on TikTok or Instagram, said Jess Maddox, an assistant professor at the University of Alabama who researches social media platforms and internet popular culture. \\n   \\n      Snapchat says that much of its daily user base is distinct from other platforms, according to a study of 10,000 users conducted on Snap’s behalf by market research firm GWI during the first half of 2023. The group found that 43% of the people aged 16-64 who used Snapchat did not use TikTok, and more than half of daily Snapchatters in the same age range were not using YouTube on a daily basis. \\n   \\n      “Snapchat was really kind of created as an antidote to traditional social media,” Brody said. “This was a platform for connecting with your closest friends, not everybody you’ve ever met … and because of that, people come to Snapchat for a very different reason than why they go to other platforms.” \\n   \\n      Market research firm Insider Intelligence estimated in a June report that Snapchat would overtake TikTok as the fastest growing platform worldwide as of the end of 2023. Already, parent company Snap said at its February investor day that it has 150 million monthly active users in North America — a figure that mirrors the number of users that TikTok says it has in the United States (although TikTok did not specify how often those users are interacting with the app). \\n   \\n      A major portion of that growth is coming from outside of the United States. Snapchat has, for example, made a big push into India, following the country’s TikTok ban in 2020. Users from outside of North America and Europe now make up more than half of Snapchat’s daily active user base and grew at a rate of 25% year-over-year in the second quarter of 2023, compared to 14% overall daily active user growth.  \\n   \\n      Snapchat’s task now: making a meaningful profit from all of those users.  \\n   \\n      “The biggest reason [for its financial challenges] is that when you think about Snap, they are largely a messaging platform, and it is extremely difficult … to monetize messaging platforms,” CFRA’s Zino said. Other major tech companies that operate messaging platforms, including Meta and Apple, don’t count on those services to generate significant revenue, if any.  \\n   \\n      What’s more, advertisers are increasingly looking to invest in so-called “direct response” advertising where users are immediately prompted to buy a product — advertising that is much more easily done on a platform like Instagram where users are already often discussing specific products and it’s easy to link to an advertiser’s website or push users to buy directly on the platform’s e-commerce section. Snapchat, by contrast, has traditionally leaned more heavily into brand awareness, said Scott Kessler, global technology sector lead at research firm Third Bridge, although the company now also gets the majority of its revenue from direct response ads.  \\n   \\n      “While there still is brand advertising online for sure, I think that there are a lot of challenges and a lot of conversations about what this looks like going forward,” Kessler said. “Snap is in a uniquely challenged position because of its historical focus on brand advertising.”  \\n   \\n      Snapchat has also placed a greater emphasis on user privacy than many of its peers — a boon to users but a challenge for advertising, Kessler noted.  \\n   \\n      Engagement time on Snapchat may also play a role — the app has the lowest user time spent compared to social media peers, likely owing to its focus on messaging rather than endless scrolling through content, according to market intelligence firm SensorTower. The average Snapchat user in the third quarter of 2023 spent just 19 minutes per day on the app, compared to 103 minutes per day on TikTok, 60 minutes per day on Instagram and 28 minutes per day on X, SensorTower data shows.  \\n   \\n      But Snapchat says its users are checking in on the app regularly — 40 times a day on average in the United States, according to Brody.  \\n   \\n      Spiegel said during Snap’s July earnings call that following its restructuring last year, which cut 20% of its staff, the company is investing heavily to improve its direct response advertising business. He added that the company’s active advertisers were up 20% year-over-year. \\n   \\n      And Brody says those investments should enable the platform to better capitalize on its user base.   \\n   \\n      “At the end of the day, digital advertising is built on reach and engagement, and we have been growing both steadily,” he said. “It’s been a transition year for us in terms of really rebuilding a lot of the foundational pieces of our ad platform and we’re seeing some really promising signs there. And these ad platforms improvements will allow us to truly capitalize on this opportunity … in the future.” \\n  ',\n",

       "  'contents': ' \\n      The fallout from the colossal implosion of Sam Bankman-Fried’s crypto business is still rippling through the digital asset industry nearly a year later.\\n   \\n      On Thursday, New York’s attorney general filed a lawsuit against three digital asset firms that were caught up in the collapse of Bankman-Fried’s empire last fall — Gemini Trust, Genesis Global Capital and Digital Currency Group, parent company of Genesis. The lawsuit accused the companies of lying to investors and covering up more than $1 billion in losses. \\n   \\n      The AG’s office said that an investigation found Gemini, the crypto firm founded by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, deceived investors about significant risks associated with a lending service it ran jointly with Genesis. The program, called Gemini Earn, marketed itself as a low-risk investment in which customers could lend crypto assets to Genesis while earning interest payments as high as 8%.  \\n   \\n      “These cryptocurrency companies lied to investors,” Attorney General Letitia James said in a statement. “And it was middle-class investors who suffered as a result.” At least 29,000 New Yorkers were among the 230,000 investors whose money was lost, James said. \\n   \\n      James’ lawsuit is the latest effort among US officials to crack down on the trillion-dollar crypto industry, which for years has operated in the shadows of traditional financial regulation. Crypto advocates argue that regulators have dragged their feet in establishing guidelines for digital assets, which they believe are distinct from traditional securities like stocks or bonds. \\n   \\n      In the immediate aftermath of the FTX crash, Genesis froze customer redemptions in its lending unit, citing market turmoil. The lending unit later filed for bankruptcy. \\n   \\n      According to the latest lawsuit, Gemini knew that Genesis’ loans were risky and, at one point, “highly concentrated” with Bankman-Fried’s crypto trading house Alameda Research. Bankman-Fried is currently on trial in federal court in New York, where he has pleaded not guilty to seven counts of fraud and conspiracy. \\n   \\n      “Gemini hid the risks of investing with Genesis, and Genesis lied to the public about its losses,” James said.\\n   \\n      The lawsuit also names former Genesis CEO Soichiro “Michael” Moro and Digital Currency Group CEO Barry Silbert.\\n   \\n      Gemini’s owners, the Winklevoss twins, have said Genesis owed more than $900 million to some 340,000 customers using the Earn program.\\n   \\n      The AG’s lawsuit follows another civil action brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which in January sued Genesis and Gemini for offering unregistered securities through the Earn product. \\n   \\n      Gemini responded to the latest suit Thursday with a statement on X (formerly Twitter), claiming that Gemini itself was the victim of a “massive fraud.”\\n   \\n      “The NY AG’s lawsuit confirms what we’ve been saying all along” — that Gemini, its customers and other creditors were lied to about Genesis’ finances. But the company said it “wholly” disagrees with the lawsuit. \\n   \\n      “Blaming a victim for being defrauded and lied to makes no sense and we look forward to defending ourselves against this inconsistent position.”\\n   \\n      A Genesis spokesperson said that “while there is no basis for the NYAG’s claims against Genesis, we have been cooperating with all authorities and intend to continue doing so.”\\n   \\n      “Genesis has not violated the law and continues to focus on maximizing recoveries for creditors in its Chapter 11 cases,” the spokesperson added.\\n  ',\n",

It also supports the hover feature, which allows users to preview and switch between different tools and app controls, when used with a 12.9-inch iPad Pro 12.9-inch (6th generation) and 11-inch iPad Pro (4th generation). The price is $79, down $20 from the second-generation Apple Pencil and $50 less than the original. \\n   \\n      The biggest change to the latest model comes to the charging system, which is noteworthy not only because the company has been resistant to making the switch for years but because it’s about to make charging that much easier for its customers.\\n   \\n      At its iPhone 15 event in September, the company announced all of its next-generation smartphones and new AirPods Pro will launch with USB-C charging. Apple previously switched its iPads and MacBooks to USB-C charging, but the push to finally add it to iPhones came less than a year after the European Union voted to approve legislation to require smartphones, tablets, digital cameras, portable speakers and other small devices to support USB-C charging by 2024. \\n   \\n      The first-of-its-kind law aims to pare down the number of chargers and cables consumers must contend with when they purchase a new device and to allow users to mix and match devices and chargers even if they were produced by different manufacturers. In doing so, however, Apple will give up control of its wired charging ecosystem, and identifying good chargers from bad ones won’t be obvious to many consumers.\\n   \\n      Although Apple does not break out its Pencil sales numbers, David McQueen, a director at ABI Research, estimates about 42 million have been sold since it launched in 2015, considering 420 million iPads have been sold since then (assuming 10% or fewer of these consumers have bought an Apple Pencil).\\n   \\n      “I’d have to think it’d be this low because of its relatively high price, high-end use case, and the availability of much cheaper alternatives that are capable of working with iPad,” he said.\\n  ',\n",

Since then, senior administration officials have suggested they needed to be adjusted due to technological developments.\\n   \\n      Raimondo, who visited China in August, said the administration was “laser-focused” on slowing the advancement of China’s military. She emphasized that Washington had opted not to go further in restricting chips for other applications.\\n   \\n      Chips used in phones, video games and electric vehicles were purposefully carved out from the new rules, according to senior administration officials.\\n   \\n      But these assurances are unlikely to placate Beijing, which has vowed to “win the battle” in core technologies in order to bolster the country’s position as a tech superpower.\\n   \\n      China’s Foreign Ministry criticized the Biden administration’s new rules Monday, before they were officially unveiled. \\n   \\n      “The US needs to stop politicizing and weaponizing trade and tech issues and stop destabilizing global industrial and supply chains,” spokesperson Mao Ning told a press briefing. “We will closely follow the developments and firmly safeguard our rights and interests.”\\n   \\n      As part of ongoing dialogue established by Raimondo and other US officials with their Chinese counterparts, Beijing was informed of the impending updates, according to a senior administration official.\\n   \\n      “We let the Chinese know for clarity that these rules were coming, but there was no negotiation with them,” the official told reporters. \\n   \\n      The tech rivalry between the world’s two largest economies has been heating up. In recent months, the United States has enlisted its allies in Europe and Asia in restricting sales of advanced chipmaking equipment to China.\\n   \\n      In July, Beijing hit back by imposing its own curbs on exports of germanium and gallium, two elements essential for making semiconductors.\\n   \\n      Shares of US chipmakers fell Tuesday following the announcement of new export controls.\\n   \\n      Nvidia’s (NVDA) stock closed down 4.7%, while Intel (INTC) slipped 1.4%. AMD (AMD) shares ended 1.2% lower.\\n   \\n      In its filing, Nvidia said the rules imposed new licensing requirements for exports to China and other markets such as Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Vietnam.\\n   \\n      The company said its A800 chip, which was reportedly created for Chinese customers in order to circumvent last year’s restrictions, would be among the components affected. \\n   \\n      However, “given the strength of demand for our products worldwide, we do not anticipate that the additional restrictions will have a near-term meaningful impact on our financial results,” Nvidia said.\\n   \\n      The broader US chipmaking industry is also examining the impact of the new rules.\\n   \\n      The Semiconductor Industry Association said in a statement Tuesday that while it recognized the need to protect national security, “overly broad, unilateral controls risk harming the US semiconductor ecosystem without advancing national security as they encourage overseas customers to look elsewhere.” \\n   \\n      “We urge the administration to strengthen coordination with allies to ensure a level playing field for all companies,” added the group, which represents 99% of the US chip sector.\\n   \\n      The measures are also being reviewed in Europe. On Tuesday, ASML, the Dutch chipmaking equipment manufacturer, said it was evaluating the implications of the rules, though it did not expect them “to have a material impact on our financial outlook for 2023.”\\n   \\n      During a call Wednesday about the company’s third-quarter results, ASML chief executive Peter Wennink said the updated export restrictions would affect between 10% and 15% of the firm’s sales to China. \\n   \\n      On Tuesday, the US Department of Commerce added 13 Chinese entities to a list of firms with which US companies may not do business for national security reasons.\\n   \\n      They include two Chinese startups, Biren Technology and Moore Thread Intelligent Technology, and their subsidiaries. \\n   \\n      The department alleges that these companies are “involved in the development of advanced computing chips that have been found to be engaged in activities contrary to US national security.” \\n   \\n      CNN has reached out to Biren and Moore Thread for comment.\\n   \\n— Anna Cooban contributed reporting.\\n',\n",

Separately, Bloomberg reported on Monday financial firm Jefferies said iPhone 15 sales dropped by a double-digit percentage following strong customer demand for Huawei’s new Mate 60 smartphone line.\\n   \\n      Apple\\n            \\n                (AAPL) shares fell 0.08% following the reports.\\n   \\n      The reports come amid a floundering Chinese economy, a struggling housing market, and more competition among higher-end vendors in China, particularly from Chinese device manufacturer Huawei.\\n   \\n      “We’re seeing a lot of nationalism right now as Chinese consumers who think they’ve been wronged by the US government and sanctions are gravitating toward the Mate 60 and that is edging into Apple volumes,” Jeff Fieldhack, research director at Counterpoint, told CNN.\\n   \\n      At the same time, China remains very important to Apple as it is the largest market behind the US. Fieldhack said he doesn’t believe Huawei will surpass Apple right now in terms of smartphone sales but expects continued interest in the Mate 60 will continue to “eek” into Apple’s numbers. \\n   \\n      “Apple made a lot of gains during its launch period last year, where it became number one in China,” he said. “Things looked strong but now, with the political tension and competition, that is a reason for concern.”\\n   \\n      However, the Phone 15 lineup is up about 10% year-over-year in the US, according to Counterpoint. That’s strong growth for Apple considering sales fell for the third consecutive quarter in August, ahead of the iPhone 15 launch. \\n   \\n      The latest iPhone 15 devices come with a slimmer design, a more-advanced main camera system and a customizable Action button, which gives the silence button additional controls, from starting a voice memo to writing a note. Perhaps the biggest change coming to the models is that they will now use a USB-C charging cord, ending an 11-year run with Apple’s proprietary Lightning charging cable.\\n   \\n      This isn’t the first time the Mate 60 has made headlines since its late August launch. In September, the US government sought more information about the Mate 60 Pro’s 5G Kirin 9000s processor reportedly developed specifically for the manufacturer. Its debut shocked industry experts who questioned how the company could make such a chip following sweeping efforts by the United States to restrict China’s access to foreign chip technology because of perceived national security concerns.\\n  ',\n",

Ultra-exclusive, few have seen it, and even fewer have played it.\\n   \\n      For Bobby Weed, it was at once the most straightforward and most difficult brief he had ever received: “Build me the best golf course. Build me the best driving range.”\\n   \\n      And there had been plenty of briefs before. A protégé, then close friend, of legendary course designer Pete Dye, the South Carolinian served as the PGA Tour’s chief architect before launching his own course design company in 1994.\\n   \\n      Almost three decades on, Bobby Weed Golf Design has sculpted more than 20 courses from the ground up – from Stillwater, Minnesota, to Mito, Japan — and renovated many more, including Hobe Sound’s Medalist Golf Club in 2015.\\n   \\n      With Tiger Woods headlining a member’s list that reads like a who’s who of the game’s elite, the Medalist is a private club that attracts a star-studded cohort of visitors. Among them was Jordan, a keen admirer of the revamp and who, in late 2017, was on the hunt for a course architect.\\n   \\n      A meeting later, Weed’s team was signed on to construct a golf kingdom fit for “His Airness.” As one of history’s most famous athletes, and with a net worth edging towards the $2 billion mark, according to Forbes, Jordan was a special category of client.\\n   \\n      “I knew that it would get a lot of attention because of MJ,” Weed, 68, told CNN.\\n   \\n      “I knew that there was some fanfare associated with it and I didn’t want to let him down.”\\n   \\n      The land was secured soon after, some 200-plus acres of former citrus grove, next to Atlantic Ridge State Park. As he often does for projects, Weed lived on site, making the 265-mile switch across the state from Ponte Vedra Beach.\\n   \\n      Weed was all-in, and encouraged Jordan to be as engaged as he wanted to be in developments, inviting him to come out once weekly to track the progress. Jordan often visited multiple times a week.\\n   \\n      Weed likens his role as course architect to that of a quarterback: calling plays for a large roster of consultants.

Even the grass on the tees is customizable, with different types to mimic warm or cool seasons.\\n   \\n      “It’s a Tour player’s haven to work on their game,” said Weed.\\n   \\n      Compared to Bobby Weed Golf Design, Nichols Architects had considerably less experience in golf courses, but it did have one key advantage in its efforts to beat other bids to build The Grove XXIII’s clubhouse.\\n   \\n      Specializing in hospitality, residential, and commercial design, the firm had worked on the W South Beach in Miami — the favorite hotel of Jordan’s wife Yvette Prieto.\\n   \\n      The team pulled no punches with its pitch to Jordan. “You’re not going to confuse this clubhouse with a clubhouse down the road or anything like that, and that’s what we’re selling you,” planning and design partner Igor Reyes told CNN of the pitching process, likening it to that depicted in the “Air” movie, where Nike must lure a rookie Jordan away from a deal with Adidas.\\n   \\n      “You’ve really got to make an architectural iconic shape, and a shape that you could almost immediately feel was swinging across the landscape. Hopefully you can almost read the concept without anybody having to tell you,” Reyes said.\\n   \\n      The deal clincher — outlined to Jordan in a pitch video — was that clubhouse shape, inspired by the smooth, “almost machine-like” perfection of a golf swing.\\n   \\n      Reyes said his team had heard of Jordan’s purported early struggles with his swing, and, in the video, set up a column grid to map the building’s structure onto Tiger Woods’ club trajectory. Jordan was captivated, and told the firm there and then that it would get the contract.\\n   \\n      “The first time you walk into the room with him, you don’t want to get too close or anything like that, it was kind of an odd thing,” Reyes said. “But by the second or third meeting we were just talking to him like a ‘regular’ client with a huge amount of respect.\\n   \\n      “There was a really a sense of, ‘This isn’t just a guy with a lot of money that wants to do something. This guy knows what he’s doing, he knows what he likes, and how to get to it.’”\\n   \\n      Inside, 15,000 square feet of space leaves ample room for men’s and women’s lockers, indoor and outdoor lounge areas, kitchen and dining facilities, and even a shop.

       " {'headline': '\\n      Six bull sharks inadvertently made their home on an Australian golf course. Then they vanished\\n    ',\n",
       "  'contents': ' \\n      For golfers, staying out of the water could be the difference between winning and losing. At one course in Australia, it was the difference between life and death.\\n   \\n      Because Carbrook in Queensland boasted a membership unlike any other golf club on the planet: six resident bull sharks.\\n   \\n      From their mysterious arrival to their devastating disappearance 17 years later, this is the tale of the sport’s most hazardous water hazard.\\n   \\n      A lake on a landlocked golf course some 14 kilometers (8.7 miles) from the Pacific Ocean may sound like a swim too far for any fish, but the bull shark has a reputation for dipping its fins into a range of habitats.\\n   \\n      River shark, freshwater whaler, estuary whaler, swan river whaler – the clue is in its other names. While native to warm and tropical waters worldwide, bull sharks have organs specially adapted to retain salt, allowing them to venture deep into freshwater environments that would prove fatal to other sharks due to a loss of sodium.\\n   \\n      Hence the presence of the stocky-built, blunt-nosed sharks in the Logan River – which slices inland from the sea halfway between Brisbane and Gold Coast before meandering around Carbrook golf club – came as no real surprise to locals in the 1990s.\\n   \\n      Neither did severe flooding.\\n   \\n      Twinned with the region’s subtropical climate, the club has been a hotspot for floods since its inception in 1978, inundated with water on numerous occasions including in 1991, 1995 and 1996.\\n   \\n      The downpours were so torrential that on the latter three occasions, the roughly 100-meter land bridge separating the river from the sand-mine-turned-lake beside the course’s 14th hole was totally submerged. A new corridor was opened and – sometime during those three temporary windows – six bull sharks glided into uncharted waters.\\n   \\n      As the land bridge dried and reformed, the door slammed shut behind them. It would remain closed for 17 years, when the next severe flood event reforged a path to the river in 2013.\\n   \\n      Towards the end of the century, whispers began to trickle around Carbrook’s fairways – all originating from the 14th green.\\n   \\n      There were reports of loud splashes, large dark shapes moving below the lake’s surface, even laughed-off claims of a tall dorsal fin knifing through the water. “The Carbrook Shark” became a kind of folk legend, Australia’s own Bigfoot, Yeti or – most similarly of all – a local version of another famous lake-dwelling mythical beast.\\n   \\n      “The Loch Ness monster is pretty similar to what it felt like,” Carbrook general manager Scott Wagstaff told CNN.\\n   \\n      “It seemed possible but there wasn’t enough truth to it at that point.”\\n   \\n      That was until the early 2000s, when the Brisbane-based Courier Mail turned folklore into fact by publishing a picture of one of the sharks, Wagstaff recalled. Yet despite having played at the club for years, he had never seen them with his own eyes when he started work there in 2010.\\n   \\n      Determined to satisfy his curiosity, Wagstaff ventured down to the lake armed with his camera and some meat.

       " {'headline': '\\n      Six bull sharks inadvertently made their home on an Australian golf course. Then they vanished\\n    ',\n",
       "  'contents': ' \\n      For golfers, staying out of the water could be the difference between winning and losing. At one course in Australia, it was the difference between life and death.\\n   \\n      Because Carbrook in Queensland boasted a membership unlike any other golf club on the planet: six resident bull sharks.\\n   \\n      From their mysterious arrival to their devastating disappearance 17 years later, this is the tale of the sport’s most hazardous water hazard.\\n   \\n      A lake on a landlocked golf course some 14 kilometers (8.7 miles) from the Pacific Ocean may sound like a swim too far for any fish, but the bull shark has a reputation for dipping its fins into a range of habitats.\\n   \\n      River shark, freshwater whaler, estuary whaler, swan river whaler – the clue is in its other names. While native to warm and tropical waters worldwide, bull sharks have organs specially adapted to retain salt, allowing them to venture deep into freshwater environments that would prove fatal to other sharks due to a loss of sodium.\\n   \\n      Hence the presence of the stocky-built, blunt-nosed sharks in the Logan River – which slices inland from the sea halfway between Brisbane and Gold Coast before meandering around Carbrook golf club – came as no real surprise to locals in the 1990s.\\n   \\n      Neither did severe flooding.\\n   \\n      Twinned with the region’s subtropical climate, the club has been a hotspot for floods since its inception in 1978, inundated with water on numerous occasions including in 1991, 1995 and 1996.\\n   \\n      The downpours were so torrential that on the latter three occasions, the roughly 100-meter land bridge separating the river from the sand-mine-turned-lake beside the course’s 14th hole was totally submerged. A new corridor was opened and – sometime during those three temporary windows – six bull sharks glided into uncharted waters.\\n   \\n      As the land bridge dried and reformed, the door slammed shut behind them. It would remain closed for 17 years, when the next severe flood event reforged a path to the river in 2013.\\n   \\n      Towards the end of the century, whispers began to trickle around Carbrook’s fairways – all originating from the 14th green.\\n   \\n      There were reports of loud splashes, large dark shapes moving below the lake’s surface, even laughed-off claims of a tall dorsal fin knifing through the water. “The Carbrook Shark” became a kind of folk legend, Australia’s own Bigfoot, Yeti or – most similarly of all – a local version of another famous lake-dwelling mythical beast.\\n   \\n      “The Loch Ness monster is pretty similar to what it felt like,” Carbrook general manager Scott Wagstaff told CNN.\\n   \\n      “It seemed possible but there wasn’t enough truth to it at that point.”\\n   \\n      That was until the early 2000s, when the Brisbane-based Courier Mail turned folklore into fact by publishing a picture of one of the sharks, Wagstaff recalled. Yet despite having played at the club for years, he had never seen them with his own eyes when he started work there in 2010.\\n   \\n      Determined to satisfy his curiosity, Wagstaff ventured down to the lake armed with his camera and some meat. No sooner had the bait hit the surface, a shark duly appeared.\\n   \\n      The stunned Wagstaff snapped some shots before taking a short video on his phone to post online. The footage was – by his own admission – “terrible,” but the internet lapped it up: the viral YouTube video has amassed more than 2.3 million views to date.\\n   \\n      Media interest boomed, and the club embraced its toothy tenants with vigor.\\n   \\n      A bull shark was added to the club’s logo, its youth program was named the Junior Shark Academy, and feedings were held at tournaments and corporate events – including one special wedding in 2009 where all six sharks appeared at once, Wagstaff recalls.\\n   \\n      Despite his affection for the sharks, Wagstaff was reluctant to call them pets, though he did nickname one “Patch,” thanks to its distinct back marking.\\n   \\n      Compared to the crocodiles and snakes dotting other courses in the country, Carbrook’s sharks made for extremely low-maintenance residents.

After surviving the eruption\\xa0of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD, the nearly 2,000-year-old documents would crumble if anyone attempted to unroll them, and surviving pieces with writing were considered to be nearly illegible to the human eye — until now.\\n   \\n      After two millennia, the first full word from one of the unopened ancient papyri has been decoded with the help of computer technology and advanced artificial intelligence, according to\\xa0an announcement made\\xa0by\\xa0a team of researchers who launched the\\xa0“Vesuvius Challenge,” a competition designed to accelerate the discoveries made on the scrolls.\\n   \\n      The word, “πορφυρας” or “porphyras,” which is the Greek word for purple, was found first by University of Nebraska computer science student Luke Farritor, who participated in the contest, which calls for competitors to apply a technique known as “virtual wrapping” to two rolled-up scrolls\\xa0released on the site, in an attempt to decipher the hidden words.\\n   \\n      Virtual unwrapping begins with computer tomography, an X-ray procedure that is used to scan each coiled-up, warped papyrus. After following along the curved layers in the scan, researchers then virtually flatten the scrolls and explore them using advanced AI that has been trained to find the ink on the page. The technology was created by University of Kentucky computer science professor Brent Seales and has been in development for nearly 20 years now.\\n   \\n      But efforts to interpret the scrolls have been going on much longer.\\n   \\n      The 79 AD eruption of\\xa0Vesuvius, a volcano\\xa0located near Naples, Italy, covered the ancient Roman cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum in volcanic mud. Herculaneum and the scrolls remained buried until the city’s accidental rediscovery by a worker drilling for a well in the early 1700s,\\xa0according to the Herculaneum Society.\\n   \\n      Approximately 1,100 carbonized scrolls, now referred to as the Herculaneum scrolls, were recovered from a building that was believed to be Julius Caesar’s father-in-law’s house,\\xa0according to the University of Kentucky. The collection is referred to as the only known large-scale library from\\xa0the classical\\xa0antiquity.\\n   \\n      In the 19th\\xa0century, hundreds of scrolls were pulled apart by machine and the brittle papyri were left in pieces, according to the university’s website.\\n   \\n      Like many other Herculaneum papyrologists,\\xa0Michael McOsker, a postdoctoral researcher in papyrology at the University College London who was not involved with the discovery, has been studying the scrolls that were previously unrolled, which had caused the papyri to be fragmentary and hard to read, he said.\\n   \\n      “Obviously, there’s a long way to go before we can read a whole roll, which is the real goal, but I’m sure it’s a solvable problem now, and one that might not even take that long,” McOsker said in an email, regarding the recent discovery.\\n   \\n      “The unrolled papyri are rewarding and important, but it’ll be a quantum leap forward to have complete texts… I’m paralyzed by the number of options and just feel grateful for any new work from antiquity that we find. It’ll be so exciting to study whatever we find.”\\n   \\n      Farritor and Youssef Nader, a biorobotics graduate student at Freie University Berlin, worked independently of one another and found the same word. They shared the “First Letters Prize” of $50,000, with Farritor awarded $40,000 and Nader earning $10,000. But the grand prize of the Vesuvius Challenge — $700,000 for the first team that can read four continuous passages at the minimum length of 140 characters — is still up for grabs.\\n   \\n      Seales hopes that a partially read scroll, satisfactory with the contest conditions, will be seen by the end of this year, while a whole scroll might be deciphered by the end of 2024.\\n   \\n      “This material goes back 2,000 years — there were people who wrote this,” Seales said. “They wrote about love, they wrote about war, they wrote about peace, they argued with each other. These manuscripts are dialogues that they’re having about philosophical views of the world.\\n   \\n      “And so even if we learn nothing, but the deep connection that we have to the ancients in terms of humanity, that’s still significant.”\\n   \\nClarification: This story has been updated to reflect the breakdown of prize money won by Luke Farritor and Youssef Nader.\\n',\n",

       "  'contents': ' \\n      Idina Menzel has shared about some of the “very complicated” reasons she and Taye Diggs split in 2013.\\n   \\n      The “Wicked” star appeared on a recent episode of the podcast “Dinner’s on Me with Jesse Tyler Ferguson.” Ferguson explained that he went from being a fan of Menzel from her time starring in the original Broadway production of “Rent” to costarring with her in “Hair” and becoming friends.\\n   \\n      “Rent” is also where she met Diggs. The former couple married in 2003 and years later welcomed a son, Walker. \\n   \\n      Menzel told Ferguson that while they have always been supportive of each other, being in an interracial relationship brought them outside pressures. \\n   \\n      “The thing that came into play more, I would say, and he’s talked about it too, is the interracial aspect of it,” she said. “When you’re in the theater, it’s just not a thing. We all love each other, sleep with each other and [are] best friends with whoever wants to be, whatever sexual orientation.”\\n   \\n      But leaving the “cocoon” of the theater world was different, she said. \\n   \\n      “I think he had his own stuff to deal with, with that,” she said of Diggs. “It seemed like there was disappointment in the community with him because he was married to a little white Jewish girl from some show that we don’t even remember. So I took that on, too.”\\n   \\n      Diggs talked their split with Redbook in a 2014 interview.\\n   \\n      “I’d be lying if I said there weren’t times when I thought, ‘Oh, man, people are going to trip out [if we split]. Maybe they thought it was cute that we met in ‘Rent,’” he said. “There weren’t a lot of couples like us in the theater community—and I know there aren’t a lot of performers as talented as she is… and then you have the whole mixed [race] thing. It was easy for people to root for us.”\\n   \\n      Menzel married actor turned therapist Aaron Lohr in 2017.\\n  ',\n",

       "  'contents': ' \\n      Having passengers shuffle down the jetway and fumble their way into the cramped seats of a commercial flight is one of the most time-consuming, logistical nightmares that major US airlines execute thousands of times each day.\\n   \\n      Now, the airline with the most planes will start packing in passengers using a new method.\\xa0United Airlines says its six-group boarding procedure will be “improved to save up to two minutes of boarding time.”\\n   \\n      Starting October 26, United says\\xa0that after the initial boarding groups enter,\\xa0window seat passengers in economy class without frequent flyer status will board next. They’ll be followed by those in middle seats, and passengers in aisle seats will board last.\\n   \\n      The process, abbreviated as WILMA for window-middle-aisle, “was tested at four domestic line stations and one hub and it’s faster,” United said in a company memo to its customer service representatives.\\n   \\n      United’s change also means those who book window seats could have a slight edge for coveted and limited overhead bin space.\\n   \\n      “Saving even one minute in airplane turn time can sum up to several hundred million dollars per year for a large airline,” says John Milne of Clarkson University in Potsdam, New York. Milne’s co-authored more than 20 journal articles on the topic of airplane boarding.\\n   \\n      Milne says the time savings come down to better utilizing a key airline resource –airplanes – adding “particularly large savings for an airline result when the boarding time reduction leads to offering an additional flight during the day.”\\n   \\n      The move is the latest change in boarding procedures by a major airline in the United States.\\n   \\n      American Airlines switched to a nine-group boarding system in 2017 and made some tweaks to that system in 2023.\\n   \\n      Earlier this year, Southwest Airlines, which doesn’t assign seats,\\xa0announced changes to its three-group boarding system by limiting the number of passengers who could buy early bird check-in slots in order to snag a better seat.\\n   \\n      There must be a better way, right? Milne is an advocate of the “reverse pyramid” method with four boarding groups.\\n   \\n      The first is of passengers with window seats in the back half of the plane. The second is passengers with middle seats in the back half of the plane and window seats in the front half. The third group is middle seats in the front half of the plane and aisle seats in the back half. The fourth and final group is aisle seats in the front half of the plane.\\n   \\n      “The Reverse Pyramid method boards faster than WILMA and it remains simple,” Milne says. “If airlines can tolerate more complexity – and there is little evidence that they do – there are even better methods.”\\n   \\n      United’s new boarding procedure makes no changes to pre-boarding for those with disabilities or those with the highest level of frequent flyer status. Nor does it make any change to group one, which includes those in first and business class.\\n  ',\n",

The statement gives instructions to cruisers to contact the company, which will pay to reroute people to Amsterdam or Freeport, including covering accommodation and “itinerary.” \\n   \\n      “We understand this change is not desirable, but we are doing our best to accommodate everyone and keep this adventure on track, even if it is a little late,” they added.\\n   \\n      They said they expect to complete the purchase within a week. \\n   \\n      Meanwhile, some passengers are becoming increasingly concerned about the delays – and what they see as a lack of transparency from Life at Sea cruises.\\n   \\n      “We are all sitting on pins and needles right now – the uncertainty is excruciating,” said one resident (as passengers will be known), who wished to remain anonymous.\\n   \\n      “I’m okay with a delay, but I won’t be okay with a cancellation.”\\n   \\n      Another, who also declined to be named, fears the cruise will end up not departing at all, but says they feel “sad but proud that we signed up for such an amazing adventure.”\\n   \\n      “I just hope I get my money back if we don’t sail,” they added.\\n  ',\n",

       "  'contents': ' \\nEditor’s Note: Sign up for Unlocking the World, CNN Travel’s weekly newsletter. Get the latest news in aviation, food and drink, where to stay and other travel developments.\\n \\n      The forthcoming charge for travelers to enter Europe has been postponed – again.\\n   \\n      The ETIAS visa waiver program will come into force in 2025 – a year later than planned. \\n   \\n      On October 19, eu-LISA – the EU agency responsible for the forthcoming digital Entry/Exit system and ETIAS – informed ministers that they need more time to implement the changes. \\n   \\n      The Entry/Exit system – a central database tracking non-EU residents when they enter the block – will now come into force in the second half of 2024. Following that, the ETIAS program will start in the first half of 2025.\\n   \\n      When it does launch, ETIAS will allow entry into EU countries from $7.70. As the name suggests, it isn’t a visa – it’s a system for visitors from countries who don’t require visas to enter Europe, to preregister their visits. Those who currently need visas to enter will still need them.\\n   \\n      While many US citizens appear shocked by the move, they might be surprised that the ETIAS system is modeled on the ESTA visa waiver program, which was introduced in 2009 by the United States. And, of course, citizens of many countries need “real” visas to EU countries – which is not only a costly process, but a time-consuming one, too.\\n   \\n      ETIAS will join the myriad accommodation and “tourist taxes” that are already charged around Europe. Here’s what to know about them.\\n   \\n      Originally slated to start in May 2023, ETIAS has been pushed back several times – until now, it was down for a 2024 launch. That has now been pushed back – again – until 2025. You cannot make applications in advance, so there’s no need to worry about registering for your Mediterranean summer of 2025.\\n   \\n      Citizens of the 60 or so non-EU countries who don’t currently need a visa to the EU – such as the United States, the United Kingdom, Japan, Singapore and the UAE. EU residents are exempt, whatever their nationality.\\n   \\n      Those who currently need a visa to enter the EU, on the other hand, will still need a visa.\\n   \\n      ETIAS will be run along similar lines to the United States’ ESTA program. Travelers must request permission to enter the EU before their travel through a simple online process. \\n   \\n      It’ll cost 7 euros ($7.70) and will cover multiple entries for three years, or until your passport expires – whichever comes first. That’s cheaper than an ESTA, which costs $21 for two years.\\n   \\n      Applications should be processed in “minutes” with the vast majority completed in 96 hours, the EU predicts. “Some applicants may be asked to provide additional information or documentation or to participate in an interview with national authorities, which may take up to additional 30 days,” they warn, however. It suggests not booking flights or accommodation until you have confirmation.\\n   \\n      For more details, check out the official ETIAS website here – going through third parties may incur extra charges. \\n   \\n      Most cities in continental Europe now charge a “tourist tax” for overnight visitors – usually a few euros added to your bill at the end of your stay, though sometimes it must be paid in cash. If you’re staying in an Airbnb, hosts will often collect this from you on arrival. \\n   \\n      The taxes usually go towards buffering public services which are affected by visitors, such as trash collection and street cleaning. Amsterdam, for example, recently allocated an extra 7 million euros to its public transport network. They’re also usually only charged for a set period, usually of up to a week. That way, you’re rewarded if you stay longer.\\n   \\n      The notable exception is the UK – however, this is changing. Manchester became the first UK city to introduce a £1 ($1.30) tax on overnight stays in March 2023. Edinburgh looks set to follow, and Wales is looking to introduce a “visitor levy” for overnight stays.\\n   \\n      Then you’ll probably be paying an overnight tax wherever you do stay, since most European countries charge these taxes, though they tend to be cheaper in less popular municipalities. Don’t forget that tourism adds a heavy burden to destinations, often in countries and areas that are significantly poorer than those of the tourists themselves. \\n   \\n      Good question. Cruises are notoriously bad for the environment, as well as for cities who are engulfed by passengers on port days – passengers who spend precious little money in the destination as they’re already catered for onboard. \\n   \\n      Some cities have reacted by implementing arrival taxes on cruise passengers. If your ship docks at Barcelona for 12 hours or more you’ll pay 4.75 euros (3 euros regional fee and 1.75 euros city surcharge). Amsterdam visitors arriving on a cruise pay 8 euros. It’s only valid for boats that dock for the day – if your cruise starts or ends in Amsterdam, or if you’re staying overnight in the city, you’re exempt.\\n   \\n      It’s not just cruise ships that charge landing taxes for arriving by sea, however. Italy has the “contributo di sbarco” or disembarkation contribution that non-resident passengers must pay when arriving on islands, whether by public ferry or private boat. The price is set by local authorities.\\n   \\n      Yes – essentially, the more popular the place, the more you’ll pay. Stay in Barcelona, for example, and as well as the regular Catalonia tourist tax, you’ll be in line for a “city surcharge” imposed on stays in the region’s capital.\\n   \\n      Amsterdam charges 7% of the hotel rate plus 3 euros per person per night. \\n   \\n      In Vienna, it’s 3.2% of the total room rate, excluding breakfast and sales tax, and then lopping off 11% of the remainder. It works out as about 2.5%.\\n   \\n      In Portugal, three municipalities on the tourist-filled Algarve coastline charge tourist tax: Faro, Vila Real de Santo António and Olhão, which introduced a fee (1 euro in the winter, 2 euros otherwise) in 2023. \\n   \\n      Crucially, the posher your accommodation, the more you pay. In Rome, for example, staying in a three star hotel incurs a 4 euro nightly tax, but a four star hotel is 6 euros and five stars is 7 euros.\\n   \\n      In Venice, the tax goes from 1 euro per person per night in a one star hotel, to 5 euros in a five star. The tax is only payable for the first five nights, in a bid to get people to stay longer.\\n   \\n      And in Paris, it ranges from just 0.20 euros for a one star property to 5 euros per person per night in a swanky “palais” hotel.\\n   \\n      In France overall, the charges vary by both municipality and class of accommodation – ranging from 0.20 euros to 4.20 outside Paris.\\n   \\n      While in Greece, it’s done solely by the type of accommodation, with charges ranging from 0.50 euros to 4 euros per room per night.\\n   \\n      The much mooted “contributo di accesso” or entrance fee to Venice – which has been repeatedly postponed since first being proposed for 2019 – is now slated for 2024. Charges have been announced as starting at 3 euros on a quiet day to 10 euros at peak times. \\n   \\n      However, this charge is only for day-trippers, who are thought to form 90% of the visitor numbers, add little to the local economy but cause plenty of problems in the city. If you’re staying overnight, you’ll already have paid the overnight “city tax” and will be exempt. \\n   \\n      No. Many US states charge “accommodation taxes,” for starters – plus many US hotels add on a “resort fee” too, which doesn’t even go to the community. The taxes are also standard in the Caribbean, where they’re commonly added to hotel fees. There’s an entrance tax on tourists arriving in New Zealand, and a departure tax for vacationers departing from Japan.\\n  ',\n",
