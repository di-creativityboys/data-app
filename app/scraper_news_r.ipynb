       "' \\n      Hamas has released two more hostages following Qatari and Egyptian mediation, two Israeli officials and two other sources briefed on the matter told CNN Monday.  \\n   \\n      One source briefed on the matter said the hostages were Israeli citizens. Though details around the identities of the two hostages were not immediately clear, an Israeli official said both hostages are women. \\n   \\n      The Gaza-based militant group captured over 200 people during its brutal terror attack on Israel on October 7, when Hamas fighters killed more than 1,400 people, according to the Israel Defense Forces. In response, Israel has bombarded Gaza, killing more than 5,000 people and injured more than 15,000 in just over two weeks, according to the Gaza health ministry. The blasts have leveled entire neighborhoods, including schools and mosques, and devastated the already insufficient health care system. \\n   \\n      Hamas confirmed two hostages were released in a statement Monday. “[We] released the two detainees [ ] bearing in mind that the enemy has refused since last Friday to receive them,” Hamas spokesperson Abu Obaida said. “We have decided to release them for compelling humanitarian and health reasons.” \\n   \\n      CNN reached out to the Israeli military, which declined to comment on the statement. The Israeli Prime Minister’s Office also said they have no comment.\\n   \\n      The hostages were released to the Red Cross, according to one of the sources. One of the Israeli officials said they were not in Israel yet.\\n   \\n      The development comes after Hamas released two American hostages — Judith Tai Raanan and her 17-year-old daughter Natalie Raanan – last week. A Hamas spokesperson at the time claimed that the two US hostages had been released “for humanitarian reasons” and to “prove to the American people and the world” that claims made by the United States government “are false and baseless.”h\\n   \\n      In the past days, Israel widened its offensive against Hamas and its regional enemies, intensifying its bombardment of the besieged Gaza Strip, striking Hezbollah cells in Lebanon and targeting the occupied West Bank.\\n   \\n      Hundreds were killed in Gaza after sustained aerial assaults on Monday morning, according to the health ministry in the isolated enclave, which is controlled by Hamas. The ministry said that 436 people, including 182 children, were killed in strikes overnight, and that most of those killed were from the southern part of Gaza.\\n   \\n      A small number of relief aid trucks have been allowed to cross from Egypt into Gaza since the weekend, but relief agencies warn that the current rate of delivery will do little to address the needs of 2 million people living in the enclave.\\n   \\n      Israeli strikes appear to be ramping up; overnight blasts on Sunday were among the most sustained bombardments of northern Gaza in the past two weeks, according to a CNN team on the ground in southern Israel. They came as the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) prepares for a potential ground operation in the besieged territory. Huge numbers of troops and tanks have already massed at the border.\\n   \\n      Israel is preparing for a “multilateral operation” on Hamas from the “air, ground and sea,” Israeli defense minister Yoav Gallant said Monday. After touring the Ashdod Navy base, Gallant released a video statement instructing Israel’s soldiers to “get ready.” \\n   \\n      CNN previously reported that the Biden administration has pressed Israel to delay its imminent invasion of Gaza to allow for the release of more Hamas hostages and aid into the enclave. \\n   \\n      Amid efforts to free the hostages held by Hamas, a senior Israeli official told CNN Sunday there will be “no ceasefire” in Gaza.\\n   \\n      A total of 34 trucks filled with desperately needed aid traveled into Gaza from Egypt over the weekend. But none carried fuel supplies, which is vital for running hospitals and treating water in the isolated territory. Israel has said fuel would be purloined by Hamas.\\n   \\n      A further 20 trucks crossed Rafah into Gaza on Monday, according to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA). But UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric warned that the current aid provisions reaching Gaza were “a drop in the bucket.”\\n   \\n      “No fuel means no functioning water desalination. No fuel also means that humanitarian partners will have to focus almost their entire aid delivery operation on transporting water. It also means no bakeries and no hospitals,” the OCHA statement declared.\\n   \\n      Aid workers and international leaders warned that the supplies were insufficient to combat the “catastrophic” humanitarian situation in Gaza, while the Palestine Red Crescent Society said it is a “drop in the ocean” of what is needed.\\n   \\n      The territory normally receives 455 aid trucks per day, according to the United Nations. That means that with the weekend deliveries, Gaza is more than 7,200 truckloads of aid short of what would normally have been received between October 7 and October 22, CNN calculations suggest. That’s half of 1% – or one two-hundredth – of the amount of aid it ordinarily gets. \\n   \\n      As the situation in the strip gets increasingly dire, doctors in Gaza hospitals are being forced to operate without morphine or painkillers due to shortages, according to Leo Cans from Doctors Without Borders. \\n   \\n      “We currently have people being operated on without having morphine. It just happened to two kids,” said the head of mission in Jerusalem for the group also known as Médecins Sans Frontières. \\n   \\n      “We have a lot of kids that are unfortunately among the wounded, and I was discussing with one of our surgeons, who received a 10-year-old yesterday, burnt on 60% of the body surface, and he didn’t end up having painkillers,” Cans continued.\\n   \\n      “There is no justification at all to block these essential medicines to reach the population.” \\n   \\n      Cans also acknowledged CNN’s reporting on parents who have resorted to writing their childrens’ names on their limbs in the event that either they or the children are killed.\\n   \\n      Medical professionals have also described “catastrophic” conditions at one central Gazan hospital as electricity and fuel supplies run out and crippled medical facilities rapidly become overwhelmed with casualties.\\n   \\n      Dr. Iyad Issa Abu Zaher, director general of Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Gaza, described a “bloody day” for his staff to CNN on Sunday, saying the hospital had received up to 166 bodies and more than 300 injured people.\\n   \\n      “It’s impossible for any hospital in the world to admit this number of injured,” he said.\\n   \\n      Videos obtained by CNN showed the hospital receiving more than a dozen bodies wrapped in shrouds, while grieving family members tried to identify them.\\n   \\n      At another Gaza hospital, doctors have warned that most of the critically ill infants relying on ventilators in the neonatal unit will die if the electricity supply is interrupted. \\n   \\n      “If the electricity is stopped, there will be catastrophic events inside this unit,” said Dr. Fu’ad al-Bulbul, head of the neonatal department Unit at Al-Shifa hospital in Gaza, in a video released by the Health Ministry in Gaza. \\n   \\n      “We can save only one [or] two babies but, we cannot save all babies.”\\n   \\n      Over the weekend, Israel called once again for civilians to leave northern parts of the strip – a warning that was condemned by the World Health Organization and which the Palestinian Red Crescent said amounted to a “death penalty for patients.”\\n   \\n      Residents who chose to remain behind told CNN that no place was safe in the Gaza Strip amid Israel’s heavy bombardment.\\n   \\n      At least 26 people were killed in Israeli strikes on the Jabalia refugee camp – one of the largest in Gaza – the director of the Indonesian Hospital in Gaza, Atef Al Kahlout told CNN. In the southern city of Rafah, 29 people were killed after four houses were struck, according to the Ministry of Health in Gaza spokesperson Ashraf Al Qidra.\\n   \\n      Large plumes of smoke were seen rising from the Gaza skyline after Israeli airstrikes on the strip, a live feed on Al-Jazeera showed. Reuters showed a large smoke cloud rising from Gaza and seen from southern Israel.\\n   \\n      The bombs hit buildings in Rafah, Khan Younis, central Gaza and Gaza City, including homes, the Palestinian Interior Ministry in Gaza said. The IDF said on Monday that it struck 320 “terror targets” in Gaza, including tunnels and “dozens of operational command centers” belonging to Hamas and Islamic Jihad.\\n   \\n      “They want us all dead, they are whipping Gaza, this has nothing to do with a war against Hamas,” one resident of Jabalia, Mahmoud, said.\\n   \\n      “My mother is paralyzed, she refuses to evacuate and says there is no safe place,” he said.  \\n   \\n      Another resident of Jabalia, Mohammad Salama, said he lost 18 family members in a strike on Monday morning, mostly women and children.\\n   \\n      “There are no terrorists here, I swear on all my family members that I lost today, it’s only innocent civilians,” Salama said.\\n   \\n      On Sunday, Hamas and Israeli forces engaged in limited clashes inside Gaza – in what is believed to be one of the first significant skirmishes on the ground inside the strip since the Islamist militants’ October 7 attack on Israel that killed more than 1,400 people, mostly civilians. \\n   \\n      An IDF soldier was killed and three others were wounded during an operation in the area of Kibbutz Kissufim near Gaza on Sunday, according to IDF spokesperson Daniel Hagari. Earlier, Hamas said its fighters had destroyed two Israeli military bulldozers and a tank in an ambush near the Gazan city of Khan Younis, forcing Israeli troops to retreat without their vehicles. \\n   \\n      The United States and its allies have urged Israel to be strategic and clear about its goals during any ground operation in Gaza, warning against a prolonged occupation and placing an emphasis on avoiding civilian casualties, although the past two weeks have seen more people killed in Gaza than during any previous conflict with Israel.\\n   \\n      The mounting death toll has sparked growing protests across the Middle East and further afield as social media fills with imagery of the devastation Gazans are living through. \\n   \\n      On Sunday, US President Joe Biden made a flurry of calls to world leaders, including Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, about the ongoing conflict and amid efforts by US officials seeking to keep it from widening. \\n   \\n      The White House said Netanyahu and Biden “affirmed there will now be a continued flow” of humanitarian assistance to Gaza during their call. \\n   \\n      As Israel readies its troops around Gaza, its military has also been engaged in flare-ups elsewhere, with increasing violence in the occupied West Bank and on its northern border with Lebanon. \\n   \\n      The IDF has launched a series of raids and arrested dozens of alleged Hamas members in the West Bank since the attack on Israel earlier this month. \\n   \\n      Two Palestinians were killed after Israeli forces raided the Jalazoun refugee camp near Ramallah on Monday, according to a statement by the Palestinian Ministry of Health.\\n   \\n      The Monday raid brings the total of those killed since October 7 in the occupied West Bank by both the IDF and Israeli settlers to 95, the ministry said. \\n   \\n      The IDF told CNN that 15 wanted suspects were apprehended in the raid, 10 of whom it claimed were Hamas operatives, and that weapons and ammunition had been found.\\n   \\n      On Sunday, the IDF launched an airstrike on the Al-Ansar mosque in the West Bank refugee camp of Jenin, which it said was being used by militant groups to plan for “an imminent terror attack.” \\n   \\n      It would not say whether the strike came from a jet, in what would be the first fighter jet strike in the West Bank in nearly two decades.\\n   \\n      Meanwhile, late Sunday and into Monday, the IDF said it struck cells belonging to the Lebanon-based Hezbollah, an Iran-backed paramilitary movement, on the Lebanese side of the border, which it said had planned to launch attacks on Israel. \\n   \\n      Netanyahu warned Sunday that if Hezbollah decides to enter the war, it will be crippled “with a force [it] cannot even imagine.”\\n  '"

       "' \\n      As Rabbi Alissa Wise scrolls through social media, her feed is littered with videos of dead Palestinian children, parents holding their lifeless bodies with screams caught in their throats and eyes sunken with grief.\\n   \\n      Like millions around the world, she has been haunted by the gruesome scenes flooding out of Gaza, where civilians have endured more than two weeks of an Israeli siege and bombing campaign that has collapsed homes, destroyed vital infrastructure and sparked a humanitarian crisis. \\n   \\n      The airstrikes have killed more than 4,600 Palestinians so far, including an estimated 1,900 children, and wounded at least 14,000 others, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza. Another 1.4 million people have been internally displaced, the United Nation’s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said. \\n   \\n      “It’s wretched. I wake up every single morning with tears in my eyes, rage in my heart and I channel it into action,” Wise, a rabbinical council member with Jewish Voice for Peace, told CNN. “My coping mechanism is to yell into the void, yell into the halls of Congress.”\\n   \\n      She feels the same grief and horror over Hamas’ surprise attack in Israel on October 7, when the militant group brutally killed more than 1,400 people, including civilians and military personnel, and abducted over 200 others, according to the Israel Defense Forces.\\n   \\n      Israel says its mission in Gaza is to root out and destroy Hamas, which governs the small territory. But it is the 2.2 million Palestinians living there, unable to escape, who are bearing the brunt of the attacks.\\n   \\n      It is these lives that Wise and other Jewish American peace activists are mobilizing to save with their calls for an urgent ceasefire – even when doing so puts them at odds with some groups within their own community, including the Anti-Defamation League, who’ve questioned their morals and even accused them of being anti-Israel.\\n   \\n      On Wednesday, thousands of Jews and allies marched on Capitol Hill, where they carried Palestinian flags and rallied in support of Palestinian rights, while Wise led a smaller sit-in with hundreds of activists inside one of the Capitol buildings. The action was organized by Jewish Voice for Peace and IfNotNow, two of the largest US Jewish groups calling for a just and peaceful resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\\n   \\n      At the sit-in, led by two dozen rabbis, they blew shofars, a traditional horn made from ram’s horn and used in Jewish rituals, and shared testimonials from Palestinians suffering in Gaza. They wore shirts that read, “Not in our name,” and unfurled banners demanding a “ceasefire.”\\n   \\n      The activists also called on the US government to stop providing aid to Israel, which Wise says “encourages and funds the mass murder of Palestinians.”\\n   \\n      Wise was one of more than 355 activists, mostly Jewish, arrested during the event, according to Jewish Voice for Peace spokesperson Sonya Meyerson-Knox.\\n   \\n      Thousands more Jewish Americans continue to gather in protests across the United States, calling on President Joe Biden and other elected officials to rein in Israel – arguing more civilian deaths is not the answer to Hamas’ deadly attack.\\n   \\n      “As Jewish people whose ancestors went through the Holocaust, when we hear Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yoav Gallant use words like ‘the children of darkness’ and ‘human animals’ to describe Palestinians, we feel the resonances of that in our bones,” said IfNotNow political director Eva Borgwardt, referring to recent comments made by the Israeli officials.\\n   \\n      “We know exactly where that language leads, and we are here to stop what they clearly intend to be a genocide. We will come to the doors of our lawmakers, we will be at the doors of our lawmakers for as long as it takes.”\\n   \\n      Moments after Rabbi Wise was released by authorities, she learned one of her closest Palestinian friends lost his entire family in an Israeli airstrike in Gaza.\\n   \\n      “I fell in a puddle on the floor. It was a very sobering reminder of exactly what we’re trying to prevent,” Wise said. “It’s critical for American Jews to stand up and say, ‘never again’ is never again for anyone.” The slogan has been a rallying cry of the Jewish community since World War II.\\n   \\n      “If we’re going to learn anything from history, it’s that the things that we stand for are for everybody, no exception, and that includes Palestinians,” she added. “We’re pulling back on organizations that suggest Jewish safety must come at the expense of Palestinian life. We say, it’s not either-or, it’s all of us or none of us.”\\n   \\n      In addition to organizing civil actions, Jewish Voice for Peace and IfNotNow are also educating communities through digital media, engaging with journalists, organizing petition drives and coordinating telephone and email campaigns aimed at elected officials and news organizations. Much of their work is done in partnership with smaller Jewish groups, as well as Arab, Muslim and Palestine solidarity activists.\\n   \\n      Jewish Voice for Peace, founded in 1996, describes itself as the largest Jewish pro-Palestinian organization in the world, with over 440,000 members and supporters across 30 states. IfNotNow also has a large US network, with tens of thousands of Jewish members who have taken direct actions to protest the Israeli occupation since 2014.\\n   \\n      “The work of our movements over the past nine years and decades of work by our predecessors has been preparing all of us to meet this horrific, genocidal moment,” Borgwardt said. “Stopping this war feels like the biggest test of our lifetimes. We understand how we got here and that to end this nightmare and achieve true safety for Palestinians, Israelis and Jews, we need to end decades of occupation and apartheid and fight for equality, justice and a thriving future for all.”\\n   \\n      Still, Jewish groups that advocate for Palestinian rights face a lot of criticism, especially from pro-Israel groups who say they’re naive, misled or even antisemitic.\\n   \\n      Jonathan Greenblatt, CEO and national director for the Anti-Defamation League, told CNN that he respects the protesters’ right to free speech, but criticized them for what he called a “complete lack of moral clarity,” adding Hamas – not Israel – is responsible for the deaths of innocent civilians in Gaza.\\n   \\n      Meredith Weisel, the ADL’s DC regional director, also dismissed the protesters on Capitol Hill as a fringe minority.\\n   \\n      “Although they claim to do so, these far-left radical organizations do not represent the overwhelming majority Jewish community,” Weisel said in a statement on X. “Rather, these groups are anti-Zionists that challenge Israel’s very right to exist. Let’s be very clear – anti-Zionism is antisemitism.”\\n   \\n      Wise adamantly disagrees, explaining Zionism is the nationalist movement that emerged in the 19th century to support establishing a homeland for Jewish people in Palestine, which was administered by the British at the time. It’s not the same as Judaism, she says.\\n   \\n      “I am Jewish, I’m not a Zionist, and I reject the idea that critiquing the politics of a government, the way you would any other government, is antisemitic. Israel is not a Jew, Israel is a state,” Wise said. “The claim that it’s antisemitic is used as a cudgel to silence people and it’s really egregious, the way that they manipulate Jewish trauma.”\\n   \\n      Wise has experienced backlash for her Palestine solidarity work from within her own community – and even family.\\n   \\n      “The next time I’m at a family table, I’m kind of avoiding and dreading it. But I also feel like the important thing is that we have to fight for the future we want. I feel that the heartache of distance from my family has to be mitigated by a sense of another family and another community that you’re organizing with.”\\n   \\n      Borgwardt of IfNotNow says her group is not anti-Zionist but anti-occupation, and that she is too focused on organizing for a ceasefire to care what critics say. \\n   \\n      “As Jewish Americans, we are here through our grief to tell Biden and Congress that our grief is not their weapon and our pain is not their excuse to enable a government that has clearly genocidal intent, and they must call for a ceasefire now,” Borgwardt said.\\n   \\n      “We are here to scream louder than we ever have: Not in our name.”\\n   \\n      During Wednesday’s sit-in, the halls of Congress echoed with the synchronized voices of hundreds of Jewish Americans shouting: “End killing and the funding of killing!”\\n   \\n      The activists and their allies filled the rotunda, donning black shirts and keffiyehs, the traditional black and white checkered scarf of the Palestinian people. In between their cries for justice came tears – and long, silent hugs.\\n   \\n      “It felt so powerful and necessary to be surrounded by thousands of grieving Jews demanding that our leaders find the courage to end this violence and finally, after decades, to address its root cause: the lie that Jewish and Israeli safety requires Palestinian suffering,” Borgwardt said.\\n   \\n      Meyerson-Knox, of Jewish Voice for Peace, was also in attendance and told CNN her heart breaks for all Israelis and Palestinians killed, but she knows this war didn’t erupt in a vacuum. \\n   \\n      “The clock didn’t start on October 7,” she said. “The horrible acts that Hamas took are in no way isolated from the horrors of Israel’s military occupation and apartheid system that it has run against Palestinians for 75 years.”\\n   \\n      That’s not an excuse or a justification, Meyerson-Knox says, it’s just reality.\\n   \\n      More than half of Gaza’s population are refugees whose ancestors fled or were expelled from their homes in present-day Israel by armed Jewish groups during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, which Palestinians call al-Nakba or “the catastrophe.” Israel has never allowed them to return to their homes and many have lived in poverty ever since. \\n   \\n      In 1967, Israel seized control of Gaza in the Six-Day War with Egypt, Jordan and Syria, and held it for nearly 40 years before withdrawing troops and settlers in 2005. Since then, Israel, in coordination with Egypt, has imposed a blockade that critics say transformed Gaza into “the world’s largest open-air prison.”\\n   \\n      Hostilities have regularly broken out between Israel and Palestinian factions in Gaza, including Hamas, which was elected to power in 2006 and ousted its opposition in 2007.\\n   \\n      The situation for Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and refugee camps in surrounding countries is similarly dire.\\n   \\n      Jewish Voice for Peace and IfNotNow believe that only by addressing these issues can peace ever be achieved between Israelis and Palestinians.\\n   \\n      In this latest war, it’s difficult to predict what comes next – other than more anger, pain and sorrow, Wise says. \\n   \\n      Conditions are growing more desperate each day, the World Health Organization warns, with hospitals on the verge of collapse and Palestinians in Gaza fast running out of food, water and other critical supplies amid near-constant bombardment by Israel. \\n   \\n      Meanwhile, the activists say videos emerging from the territory are becoming increasingly alarming. One of the latest shows Palestinian parents inking their children’s names on their arms and legs so that if they’re killed, they can be identified.\\n   \\n      “The only way for me to maintain hope,” Wise said, “and to imagine a future of a free Palestine, of safety and freedom for all of us, is to take action even in the midst of the pits of despair.”\\n  '"
